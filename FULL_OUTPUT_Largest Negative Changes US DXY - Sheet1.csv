0,2025-04-10,100.870003,-0.019728,"Day after Trump announced a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. Though pause is good, markets interpreted it as evidence of US economic fragility and policy chaos. Recent: China tariffs rising to 125%",https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/business/reciprocal-tariff-pause-trump,https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/business/reciprocal-tariff-pause-trump,"President Donald Trump announced a complete three-month pause on all the “reciprocal” tariffs that went into effect at midnight, with the exception of China, a stunning reversal from a president who had insisted historically high tariffs were here to stay.
But enormous tariffs will remain on China, the world’s second-largest economy. In fact, Trump said they will be increased to 125% from 104% after China announced additional retaliatory tariffs against the United States earlier Wednesday. All other countries that were subjected to reciprocal tariff rates Wednesday will see rates go back down to the universal 10% rate, he said.
“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” Trump said in his social media post. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” he wrote.
Speaking to reporters after the announcement, Trump said, “Nothing’s over yet, but we have a tremendous amount of spirit from other countries, including China. China wants to make a deal, they just don’t know how quite to go about it.”
Mexico and Canada won’t face the 10% tariffs, a White House official told CNN. Almost every good coming from the two nations will continue to be tariffed at 25%, unless they are compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in which case they won’t face tariffs. However, that does not apply to sector-specific tariffs Trump has imposed.
Wall Street breathed a sigh of relief, however, that Trump was backing down on other extreme trade measures. Stocks rallied sharply on the news – even though the 10% universal tariff on all imports coming into the United States remained in effect.
The Dow surged nearly 3,000 points or 7.87%, on Wednesday. The S&P 500 shot up 9.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.2%. This marked the best day for the S&P 500 since October 2008. The Nasdaq posted its best day since January 2001 and its second-best day on record. While the Dow posted its best day in five years.
This comes after markets have been getting slammed by the prospect of the significantly higher tariffs Trump laid out last week.
Hours before making the announcement, Trump said “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!”
He concluded the post with “DJT,” potentially a nod to Trump Media & Technology Group Corp, which trades under the ticker “DJT.” At the time, the parent of Truth Social, DJT shares were down nearly 13% this month. After the announcement, shares were up over 20% for Wednesday alone.
Trump told reporters his decision to move forward with the pause was in part influenced by people “getting a little yippy yappy.”
“You have to have flexibility,” he added, a stark about-face from recent comments he and administration officials have made recently insisting Trump was not going to back off his promises.
Pause was baked into Trump’s tariff strategy
Shortly after the announcement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the pause was part of “his strategy all along.” But he also said that Trump had “great courage to stay the course until this moment.”
CNN previously reported that Bessent traveled to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss the tariffs with Trump, encouraging him to focus on an endgame of reaching new deals with a variety of countries.
Meanwhile, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday testified at a House hearing that he wasn’t aware of the pause until after it was announced.
Greer added he was aware the policy change was a possibility Wednesday morning, but when asked directly if he knew the policy was going into effect, he replied that the administration discusses “all kinds of policies.”
Trump later told reporters that the plan “came together early this morning” after meeting with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Bessent. “We wrote it up from our hearts.”
Bessent said Trump would be “personally involved” in all the discussions as he seeks out concessions.
“No one creates leverage for himself like President Trump,” Bessent said.
The message sought to cast to other countries was: “Do not retaliate and you will be rewarded,” he said, adding that the move “signals that President Trump cares about trade and that we want to negotiate in good faith.”
He and and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick were with Trump when he sent his message on Truth Social, Lutnick confirmed on a post on X.
“Scott Bessent and I sat with the President while he wrote one of the most extraordinary Truth posts of his Presidency,” Lutnick said. “The world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.”
Bessent didn’t offer many details on what could happen after the 90-day pause, but he said the administration will continue to have discussions with other countries in the interim. For example, he said US government officials are meeting with representatives from Vietnam on Wednesday.
“These are complicated negotiations,” he said. But having seen the “maximum level” that Trump is willing to go on tariffs, he feels more countries will be willing to give in.
Escalating tensions with China
The higher tariffs on China came after Beijing announced new retaliatory tariffs of 84% on US goods set to take effect on Thursday.
The Trump administration has taken particular aim at China’s trade practices.
“We will see what China does but what I’m certain of is what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours,” Bessent said Wednesday.
Trump appears to be ratcheting up pressure in the hopes that President Xi Jinping will blink first. He may be waiting a while, according to Wendong Zhang, an assistant professor of applied economics and policy at Cornell University.
“China has vowed to ‘fight to the end,’ and there are risks of even more escalations,” Zhang said in an email. “China has already reduced its reliance on US products, such as soybeans and other agricultural products, since the 2018-19 trade war. But this time around, Chinese leaders have the backing of a more supportive general public to stand up to the US and pivot to domestic consumption.”
Announcing China’s response, the State Council Tariff Commission said in a statement: “The US escalation of tariffs on China is a mistake upon mistake, severely infringing upon China’s legitimate rights and interests, and seriously damaging the multilateral trading system based on rules.”
The amped-up retaliation comes after China repeatedly warned that it would “fight to the end” if the US moved forward with further tariffs.
Pushing off a recession?
Economists significantly increased forecasts for a recession after Trump proceeded with the reciprocal tariff package, which called for tariffs as high as 50% impacting dozens of countries.
While the 90-day pause may have been welcome news to investors, it’s unlikely to stave off a recession, Joe Brusuelas, chief economist of RSM US, told CNN Wednesday.
“My sense here is that the (US) economy is still likely to fall into recession, given the level of simultaneous shocks that it’s absorbed,” Brusuelas said in an interview. “All this does is postpone temporarily what will likely be a series of punitive import taxes put on US trade allies.”
Goldman Sachs economists said after Wednesday’s announcement they were reverting to a prior forecast predicting a 45% chance of a recession in the next 12 months. Before the announcement, they forecast a recession as the “base case,” meaning it was highly likely to occur.
Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, which represents a wide range of importers, said the pause is “a step in the right direction.”
But he cautioned, “Let’s not celebrate the fact that it still seems to leave in place a new baseline of 10% tariffs on most countries, plus significant levies on China, steel and aluminum and autos, with the promise of more duties to come.”
Colvin was referring to the 25% tariffs that remain in place on the three industries. Trump has also vowed to impose tariffs on a slew of other industries, including lumber, pharmaceuticals and copper.
Ultimately the pause does little to alleviate businesses of the uncertainty they’ve faced since Trump’s November victory regarding the tariff environment, he said.

What world leaders are saying about Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement
From CNN's Maureen Chowdhury, Elise Hammond, James Frater, Jennifer Hauser and Joseph Ataman
U.S. President Donald Trump, accompanied by White House staff secretary Will Scharf, signs executive orders imposing tariffs at the White House on Tuesday.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said during a news conference: “For Australia these tariffs are not unexpected but let me be clear — they are totally unwarranted. Trump referred to reciprocal tariffs. A reciprocal tariff would be zero not 10%. The admin’s tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations’ partnership.”
Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristerssonsaid: “Free enterprise and competition have laid the foundations of the West’s success. That’s why Americans can listen to music on Swedish Spotify and we Swedes can listen to the same music on our American iPhones. This is why I deeply regret the path the US has embarked upon, seeking to limit trade with higher tariffs.”
Ireland’s Taoiseach Micheál Martin said: “My priority, and that of the government, is to protect Irish jobs and the Irish economy. And we will work with our companies, multinational companies and Irish companies, to navigate the period ahead.”
Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusksaid: “Friendship means partnership. Partnership means really and truly reciprocal tariffs. Adequate decisions are needed.”
A French government spokesperson accused Trump of wanting to be “master of the world,” in a rare personal attack on the US president. Sophie Primas told French radio station RTL the tariffs would be a “hard blow” for the international and European economies, but said Europe will continue to negotiate with the US. The EU is preparing countermeasures.
Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said: “It’s beyond me that the US wants to start a trade war against Europe. No one’s a winner, everyone loses. Instead of raising walls, we should bring down barriers.”
Cecilie Myrseth, Norwegian minister of trade and industry, told Norwegian state broadcaster NRK: “We are doing the calculations and looking through what has come. But it is obvious that this is serious for the world economy, and it is critical for Norway. What we can at first glance is 20% tariffs against the (European Union), and at least 10–15% against Norway. That is of great importance, because we also send a lot of exports to the EU.”
Karin Keller-Sutter, president of the Swiss Federation,said: “The Federal Council has taken note of the US decisions on tariffs. It will quickly determine the next steps. The country’s long-term economic interests are the priority. Respect for international law and free trade are fundamental.”

Small businesses will be “bearing brunt” of tariff storm, CEO tells CNN
From CNN’s Chris Lau
Small businesses in the US will be “bearing the brunt” of constantly changing tariff policies that are forcing them to raise prices for consumers, a CEO told CNN.
Adam Leeb, co-Founder of Astrohaus, which designs smart typewriters, said he and other small firms had been facing a whiplash of “policies that are changing day by day,” despite their operation requiring them to plan up to 18 months ahead.
He also said some of the tariffs the Trump administration had introduced had nothing to do with trade deficits but about combatting fentanyl trafficking and illegal immigration.
“There’s just so many different factors here, and it’s a lot of changes all at once,” Leeb said.
The CEO also said small businesses operated in competitive markets and would have to raise prices due to the costs incurred.
“There’s really no way around it,” he said, adding that both consumers and businesses were “in for some tough times” ahead.

Trump’s tariff expected to cost $5,000 per American household per year, economist says

The US tariffs unveiled on “Liberation Day” are expected to cost each American household $5,000 per year, dealing a huge blow to working and middle-class families, an economist told CNN.
Economics professor Justin Wolfers from the University of Michigan said the cost of living is also expected to go up by 6% as businesses pass extra costs incurred onto consumers.
“That’s going to turn up in prices pretty much as soon as tomorrow,” he said.
Overseas, Wolfers said poor countries — such as Papua New Guinea and Fiji — would suffer from “damaging effects,” Wolfers said, calling Trump’s tariffs “evil.”
“The idea that they are any threat to Americans is just absurd,” he said.
Rich economies, meanwhile, appear to be banding together to retaliate, leaving the US alone. “All that President trump has managed to do is isolate Americans from the rest of the global economy,” he said.
He also said it would be “nonsense” to suggest Trump’s tariffs are reciprocal in nature given most industrialized economies impose low tariffs.

Trump’s tariffs target some of the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries
From CNN’s Lex Harvey
Some of US President Donald Trump’s most punishing tariffs will target the world’s poorest and most vulnerable countries, including those in the throes of deadly civil wars and emerging from suffocating economic crises.
Five countries singled out by the US for tariffs above the 10% minimum — the Democratic Republic of the Congo (11%), Madagascar (47%), Mozambique (16%), Malawi (18%) and Syria (41%) — are among the world’s 26 poorest economies. Collectively, these economies are responsible for just 0.5% of global output and income but are home to nearly 40% of the world’s poor, according to the World Bank.
In Madagascar, an island of about 25 million people off the coast of Southern Africa, more than 80% of the population lives in extreme poverty and surviveson less than $2.15 per day.
Its exports to the US, its second-largest export market, totaled almost $800 million in 2024, consisting of mainly vanilla, apparel, titanium and cobalt.
Venezuela (15%), which also suffered from an economic collapse and humanitarian disaster, relies on the US as its biggest trading partner. The US imported $6 billion worth of goods from the South American country in 2024.
Among other countries singled out with the highest tariff rates is Myanmar (44%), a Southeast Asian nation recently hit by a massive earthquake that has killed more than 3,000 people. The country has also been embroiled in civil war for four years. Sparked by a military coup, the fighting has seen junta forces battle rebel groups across the country.

The Trump administration is using tariffs as a tool to dismantle levies imposed by other countries and create “truly free and open global trade,” a director with The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, told CNN.
Richard Stern, director of Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at The Heritage Foundation, said other countries have deployed trade barriers, subsidized their products and committed intellectual property theft.
Some context: The Heritage Foundation is a leading conservative think tank with long roots in Washington and had a major role in organizing Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for US President Donald Trump’s second term in office.
Leading economists have told CNN they feared the tariffs could lead to a global recession if they aren’t quickly pulled back.

Here’s why US tariffs will slam South Asian countries
From CNN’s Rhea Mogul and Esha Mitra
President Donald Trump’s historic tariff announcement will have a lasting impact on South Asia, where the US is a top export destination for many countries in the region, analysts say.
The region – which includes the world’s most populous country, India, as well as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka – is “dealing with varying levels of economic stress,” he said.
“There’s a lot of vulnerability, and the tariffs will hit hard,” said Michael Kugelman, South Asia Institute Director at The Wilson Center, a US-based think tank.
Trump imposed the highest tariffs in the region on Sri Lanka, at 44%. The island nation is still recovering from an economic crisis that contributed to the toppling of its government. It is now dependent on a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
Bangladesh, which has a major garment industry, is also expected to grapple with economic pressure after Trump placed 37% tariffs on imports from there.
The US has historically been a top destination for Bangladesh’s garment exports. Trump’s announcement could reduce the competitiveness of the industry, affecting jobs in the sector.
India was slapped with some of the highest tariff rates for a major US trading partner, but at 26%, was not hit as its Asian peers.
New Delhi “made many earlier concessions to Washington to try to shield itself, but it didn’t work,” said Kugelman. Its “saving grace” now is a bilateral trade deal it’s negotiating with the US, he added.
Praveen Khandelwal, a politician from India’s ruling party and head of the Confederation of All India Traders, said the government would “talk to the Trump administration about how to ensure a minimal impact on the trade between America and India.”

Trump’s tariffs will hurt Americans who love Australian beef, economist says

The 10% tariffs that President Donald Trump slapped on Australia will hurt Americans who love beef from its Pacific ally, an economist told CNN.
Richard Denniss, executive director of The Australia Institute, explained that Australia doesn’t export a large amount of beef to the US and would likely divert exports to other countries that impose lower tariffs.
“If they now want to pay more for it… That’s a ‘them’ problem, not an Australia problem.”
But he warned of the tariffs’ implications on the close ties between allies, saying that the US has essentially “ripped up” a free-trade agreement with Australia.
“The US has just shown itself to be an unreliable partner,” he said.

Trump using US consumer market as gambling chip in “high-stakes game,” CNN analyst says
From CNN’s Chris Lau
An analyst has likened President Donald Trump’s tariffs to gambling on “a global poker playing table,” warning of shaky times to come.
“It is a high-stakes game,” she told CNN’s John Vause, adding that it would rock markets.
Foroohar said the move would win the president support from auto workers back home —but hit allies.
Europe is going to come back with a “strong response,” she predicted, while reactions in developing markets may vary, she said, depending on how much they lean on the US for economic security.
The analyst also differentiated Trump’s tariffs during his first administration from the present one, saying previously the taxes were targeted, focusing primarily on China.
“I think it will certainly be the defining moment of his presidency. I’m hoping it doesn’t push the US and the world into recession,” she added.

Taiwan calls Trump’s 32% tariff ""highly unreasonable and regrettable""

President Donald Trump’s tariffs are “highly unreasonable and regrettable,” Taiwan’s cabinet said, as it vowed to lodge solemn representations with the United States.
Taiwan, a major exporting economy and electronics manufacturer, was slapped with 32% tariffs by the Trump administration. But its vital semiconductor industry was exempted.
Some context: Home to the world’s largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC), the island is a key link in the global technology supply chain for companies such as Apple and Nvidia.
The calculation of the tariff rate “lacks scientific basis” and fails to reflect the highly complementary trade relationships between the two sides, Taiwan’s cabinet – the Executive Yuan – said.
Taiwan’s trade surplus with the United States has grown in recent years, in part due to rising demand from US companies for AI-related and information products.
“This reflects Taiwan’s huge contribution to the US economy and national security, but it was used as a reason to subject Taiwan to high tariffs,” the cabinet said.
Taiwan’s cabinet has instructed the Office of Trade Negotiations to demand an explanation from the US Trade Representative, adding it will continue to engage with US officials to safeguard Taiwan’s interests.

South Korea faces dual crisis: Political uncertainty and US tariffs, analyst says
From CNN's Yoonjung Seo in Seoul and Lex Harvey
The imposition of US tariffs on South Korea will be particularly difficult for Seoul to manage effectively while the country is going through unprecedented political turmoil, says Park Sang-in, a professor of economics at Seoul National University.
On Friday, the country’s top court will decide whether to uphold the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol – who faces charges of instigating an insurrection following his short-lived martial law order last December – or reinstate him to office.
There is no doubt that the tariffs are bad for South Korea’s economy, Park told CNN on Thursday, just hours after Trump announced 25% tariffs on US imports from South Korea, a longtime US ally.
Some background: South Korea and the US have a free trade agreement, also known as the Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS), in place, but the Trump administration has imposed tariffs on South Korea differently from other free trade partners, such as Canada and Mexico.
Park said Seoul should push back strongly on US tariffs, enhance regional cooperation and diversify its trade partnerships.

The European Union is preparing countermeasures to US President Donald Trump’s announcement of 20% tariffs on imports from the bloc, which it called a “major blow to the world economy.”
The EU is a major US trading partner. Last year, it was the largest single market for US goods exports, ahead of America’s neighbors Canada and Mexico, based on figures from the United States Census Bureau.
Trump on Wednesday launched a historic global trade war, announcing sweeping global tariffs on dozens of nations, from Nicaragua to Cambodia. The tariffs come on top of previously imposed taxes on imports of steel, aluminum and cars.
While the European Union would prefer to work with the US to reduce trade barriers, “Europe is ready to respond,” she said.

Japan calls Trump tariffs “extremely regrettable” but holds off on any immediate retaliation
From CNN’s Yumi Asada, Jerome Taylor and Chris Lau
Japan, a US treaty ally and key trading partner, has described President Donald Trump’s tariffs as “extremely regrettable” but did not announce any immediate retaliation or countermeasures.
Hayashi said Japan was examining whether the decision to impose 24% tariffs on Japanese exports breaches World Trade Organization rules and the Japan-US Trade Agreement, which was signed with the first Trump administration in 2019.
Trade minister Yoji Muto told reporters that Trump’s levies “would weaken the capacity of Japanese companies to invest in the US, having a negative impact on the US economy as well.”
Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index tumbled nearly 4% at the open Thursday, reaching an eight-month low.
Limited options: Japan generally eschews direct confrontation diplomacy and had been lobbying hard behind the scenes with the Trump administration.
Analysts say Tokyo’s hands are somewhat tied by how reliant it is on US security guarantees in a tricky neighborhood.
“I think the biggest limitation Japan faces is that it’s next to China and North Korea, and it relies on America immensely for its security,” Jeffrey Hall, lecturer at the Kanda University of International Studies, told CNN.
Lodging a complaint to WTO could avoid direct confrontations.

New Zealand Prime Minster Christopher Luxon has said the tariffs announced by the US are “not good for global economics.”
New Zealand is among a group of nations that will face a baseline 10% tariff.
Foreign Minister Winston Peters cut a more optimistic figure within New Zealand’s cabinet, arguing the US announcement was cause for “celebration,” because other countries have it worse.
New Zealand has ruled out imposing reciprocal tariffs on the US. But Wellington is disputing the US claim that New Zealand imposed 20% tariffs on US goods, a figure that appeared in a list presented by US President Donald Trump as he announced the tariffs. McClay said the figure is closer to 17%.
ANZ Chief Economist Sharon Zollner told CNN the tariffs alone would not be a game-changer for New Zealand exporters, but there could be indirect impacts.

Analysis: This is the dubious way Trump appears to have calculated his ""reciprocal"" tariffs
From CNN's David Goldman
President Donald Trump’s massive tariffs announced on dozens of nations Wednesday were pitched as “reciprocal,” matching what other countries charge the United States dollar for dollar, even taking into account non-tariff barriers like value-added taxes and other such measures.
But the actual calculation the Trump administration seems to have used appears as though it is not reciprocal at all.
Matching countries’ tariffs dollar for dollar is an incredibly difficult task, involving pouring over each country’s tariff schedule and matching a complex array of products, each of which take different charges for different variants.
Instead, the Trump administration seems to have used quite a simple calculation: the country’s trade deficit divided by its exports to the United States times 1/2. That’s it.
The calculation was first suggested by journalist James Surowiecki in a post on X and backed up by Wall Street analysts.
For example, America’s trade deficit with China in 2024 was $295.4 billion, and the United States imported $439.9 billion worth of Chinese goods. That means China’s trade surplus with the United States was 67% of the value of its exports — a value the Trump administration labeled as “tariff charged to USA.”
But it was no such thing.
The simple calculation used by the Trump administration could have broad implications for countries America depends on for goods — and the global companies that supply them.
“Knowing how these rates were calculated highlights that they are generally going to be most severe on the nations that US companies rely heavily upon in their supply chain,” O’Rourke said. “It is hard to imagine how these tariffs would not wreak havoc upon the profit margins of major multinational corporations.”

Middle class car buyers “can’t afford that kind of bump,” Pennsylvania dealership owner says of Trump tariffs
From CNN’s Chris Lau
An expected hike in vehicle prices would hit American consumers so fast and hard that even better-off clients would not be able to keep up with the spike, a Pennsylvania car dealership owner told CNN.
President Donald Trump said the US would impose 25% tariff on all foreign automobiles in what he called “horrendous imbalances” that have impacted the country’s “industrial base” and put national security at risk.
It’s Trump’s move to bring more auto manufacturing back to America, but local car dealers are warning against a price hike. The tariff announcement has also caused unease among allies who export cars to the US, including Japan and South Korea.
David Kelleher, president of David Auto Group, said a $30,000 car may become $37,500, meaning that his clients could be asked to fork out $175 more per month.
“Our customers … are middle class people. They just can’t afford that kind of bump,” Kelleher said.

Trump's tariffs will probably plunge the global economy into recession this year, JPMorgan analysts says
From CNN's David Goldman and Elisabeth Buchwald
If President Donald Trump maintains the massive tariffs he announced today, his unprecedented trade policies will probably cause both the US and global economies to fall into a recession in 2025, JPMorgan analysts said in a note to investors.
That’s not exactly a shock: Prior to Trump’s universal and reciprocal tariff announcements today, JPMorgan analysts gave the US economy a 40% shot of entering a recession.
JPMorgan noted that the tariffs would hike taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, the largest tax increase in recent memory by a longshot. It will cause prices to surge, too, adding 2% to the Consumer Price Index, a measure of US inflation that has struggled to come back down to earth in recent years.
The shock will be exacerbated by plunging consumer and business sentiment and by any retaliation visited upon America as foreign countries potentially impose new tariffs on the United States.
“We thus emphasize that these policies, if sustained, would likely push the US and global economy into recession this year,” the analysts said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- The greenback is down despite outlooks for tariffs to keep interest rates high and boost the currency.
- Analysts suggest the dollar is sliding on growing doubt about the US economy and tariff fatigue.
President Donald Trump's wish for a weaker dollar is becoming a reality, but it might be a signal America's economic outlook is weakening.
The US dollar index — a gauge measuring greenback strength against a basket of major currencies — has dropped to its lowest level since November, shedding 4.5% from a mid-January peak.
Trump has said he wants to see the US dollar weaken, and spent the election floating ideas that would achieve that goal. The idea is that devaluing the currency would help US exporters stay competitive in a world of rising protectionism.
Yet, ultimately no direct intervention was needed, and the dollar has fallen recently on its own. However, it's not necessarily a positive development, and analysts suspect the greenback's drop is a sign of waning momentum in the America-first trade.
The recent dollar decline wasn't a move that analysts were betting on, predicting instead that the president's tariff plans would be a dollar boon. Economists have argued that the trade policy is inflationary, implying that higher interest rates will continue to prop up the greenback.
""We would not have expected these market moves at the start of the year,"" George Saravelos, the global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, wrote Tuesday.
Yet the dollar's plunge steepened after Trump committed to imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and additional levies on Chinese products on Tuesday.
To Saravelos, the dollar's surprising slide signals that tariffs have implications that go beyond inflation; these restrictive trade policies are slashing confidence in the US, fueling doubt in the country's growth prospects.
The dollar trade ""is reflective of the broader-based policy disruption and unpredictability from the administration, most notably trade policy and DOGE spending cuts.""
""It is reasonable in this context for the market to start pricing in a narrowing of the growth differential between the US and the rest of the world.""
Morgan Stanley strategist Matthew Hornbach echoed that sentiment this week. In a Monday note, his team suggested that investors maintain long-term trades that favor the euro and the pound over the greenback.
That's because ""US exceptionalism"" narrative is unlikely to last. Others have agreed recently, pointing to the rising success of European assets amid unraveling faith in the outperformance of US markets.
""If the narrative deteriorates over the next several months, opportunities in markets abound. Indeed, as consensus forecasts expected more US growth outperformance, markets priced a larger divergence between Fed and ECB policy rates,"" he wrote.
There are also signs that an oversaturation of tariff news coming from the White House is exerting less influence on currency moves.
""With tariff fatigue therefore seemingly observable in price action, we think it likewise reasonable to expect that investors will grow wary of holding onto dollar-positive tariff risk premium,"" Hornbach wrote.
Although a devalued dollar may play into Trump's hopes for cheaper US exports, it could upend his separate pledge to keep the greenback the world's dominant currency.
Saravelos noted that the tender may also be dropping amid signs that it is losing its status as a safe haven among global investors.
Declining correlation between the dollar and risk assets, the ""unusual"" outperformance of cheap currencies, and a current account deficit of over 4% all point to this trend, he wrote.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The U.S. was scheduled to begin collecting a 25% tariff on nearly all goods from Mexico and Canada starting at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, according to a draft public notice of the rules posted Monday. Canadian energy products would be levied at a lower rate of 10%.
Businesses ranging from automakers to alcohol producers have warned that the added costs for companies to import goods from Canada and Mexico will have wide-ranging implications across the American economy. While some companies will look to source their goods from other countries or move production to the U.S., those moves could take years.
In the meantime, companies have said they will have to pay the tariffs and then pick from two options: either pass the added costs along to consumers in the form of higher prices, or absorb the fees and either cut costs elsewhere or take lower profits.
On Monday, Trump also added an additional 10% tariff on all imports from China on top of the 10% tariff he put on Chinese goods last month, which includes products such as electronics, footwear, medicines and cosmetics. Those tariffs are in addition to tariffs already put in place during Trump's first term in office.
Trump said he is putting the tariffs in place, in part, to pressure the countries into stopping undocumented immigrants and fentanyl from entering the U.S. via their borders. More than 107,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2023, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, with nearly 70% of those deaths from opioids, including fentanyl. Nearly all of the 21,900 pounds of fentanyl seized in 2024 was at the southern border, with just 43 pounds of fentanyl seized at the northern border, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.
Late Tuesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated relief may be in sight. In an appearance on Fox Business News, Lutnick said an interim agreement with Canada and Mexico that would allow their tariffs to be rolled back to some degree could come as soon as Wednesday.
""The Mexicans and the Canadians are on the phone with me all day today, trying to show that they'll do better,"" Lutnick said. ""And the president is listening because, you know, he's very, very fair and very reasonable. So I think he's going to work something out with them.""
Lutnick continued: ""It's not going to be a pause, that pause stuff, but I think he's going to figure out you do more, and I'll meet you in the middle some way, and we're going to probably be announcing that tomorrow. So somewhere in the middle will likely be the outcome the president moving with the Canadians and Mexicans, but not all the way.""
The start of back-and-forth retaliation
The move risks a tit-for-tat trade war with Mexico, Canada and China that could hurt U.S. businesses selling their products to those countries and upended one of the signature deals of Trump's first term: the USMCA trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
That agreement, which Trump touted at the time as a negotiating victory, largely allowed products to move between the three countries tariff-free, similar to how they had for decades under the previous North American Free Trade Agreement or NAFTA. Under the terms of the deal, the agreement wasn’t supposed to be up for renegotiation until July 2026, but Trump’s move to impose new tariffs could throw the entire agreement into jeopardy.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum indicated in remarks Tuesday that her country would respond by Sunday. In a news conference, she said the action would include ""tariff and nontariff measures."" Sheinbaum also said that Mexico had already taken steps during the past month to crack down on drug gangs and trafficking flows.
Canada will move ahead with an earlier plan to impose 25% tariffs on 155 billion Canadian dollars ($107 billion) of American goods if the U.S. tariff took effect as scheduled. Tariffs on $20.7 billion worth of goods, including orange juice, peanut butter, wine and coffee, will take effect immediately, while tariffs on the remaining $86.3 billion in U.S. products will begin in 21 days, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement late Monday. They will remain until the U.S. trade action is withdrawn.
""We don't want this. We want to work with you as a friend and ally, and we don't want to see you hurt, either, but your government has chosen to do this to you,"" Trudeau said at a news conference Tuesday in remarks directed at the American people.
Then, pivoting to speaking directly to Trump, Trudeau said: ""Even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.""
He noted that even though less than 1% of fentanyl seized by the U.S. is coming across the Canadian border, the country has been taking action to further crackdown on the illegal drug trade. As a result, Trudeau said there was a 97% drop in fentanyl seizures from January compared to December, ""to a near zero low of less than half an ounce seized in January.""
China said it will impose additional tariffs on U.S. goods March 10, include a 15% tariff on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton and a 10% tariff on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, fruits, vegetables, and dairy and fish products. China said that the U.S. tariffs undermine cooperation between the world’s two largest economies and that they hurt American businesses and consumers, as well as international trade.
“The Chinese people have never believed in coercion or intimidation, nor do we succumb to bullying and hegemonic tactics,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a regular briefing in Beijing on Tuesday.
Trump had previously threatened to place a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1 before saying he was delaying those tariffs for a month, after the leaders of the two countries said they would be stepping up security at their borders. On Monday, Trump told reporters there was “no room left for Mexico or for Canada” to negotiate on the new import duties.
Economists across the political spectrum have warned that the tariffs, which are paid by the U.S. company importing the goods, would increase what consumers pay for a range of goods, including vehicles, electronics, produce and lumber. Stocks fell nearly 2% Monday, the worst day since December.
“The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy,” Michael Hanson, senior executive vice president of public affairs for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in a statement Monday. “Stacking tariffs on household goods will also raise costs on American families, millions of whom have struggled through the worst bout of inflation in forty years.”
Specific sectors where the tariffs will be felt most
Automakers are among the industries that will feel the greatest impact from the tariffs, since vehicles and their components cross between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico multiple times during the production process. Ford CEO Jim Farley warned last month that the threat of the tariffs was creating chaos in the auto industry and could have devastating consequences for American automakers.
“Let’s be real honest, long-term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canadian border will blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we have never seen,” Farley said at an investor conference last month.
The tariffs could add as much as $12,000 to the price of a new car, according to a report from the Anderson Economic Group. The American Automotive Policy Council, the industry association representing GM, Ford and Stellantis, said they believe their vehicles and parts that meet the tariff-free requirements under the previously negotiated trade deal during Trump’s first term should be exempt from the tariffs.
“Our American automakers, who invested billions in the U.S. to meet these requirements, should not have their competitiveness undermined by tariffs that will raise the cost of building vehicles in the United States and stymie investment in the American workforce, while our competitors from outside of North America benefit from easy access to our home market,” former Missouri Gov. Matt Blunt, president of the association, said in a statement.
The Aluminum Association, which represents aluminum production and jobs in the U.S., said in February that the U.S. sources two-thirds of the primary aluminum it uses every year from Canada and about 90% of scrap metal from either Canada or Mexico. It added that U.S.-based smelters, even at full capacity, “cannot produce nearly enough metal to meet demand.”
The tariffs could also contribute to higher grocery prices since Mexico is one of the top suppliers to the U.S. of tomatoes, avocados, berries and peppers. Rising food prices have been a top concern for consumers and voters, with grocery costs up around 25% over the past four years — an issue Trump pledged to tackle on the campaign trail.
The tariffs could also increase the prices of beer and alcohol imported from Mexico and Canada and hurt sales of U.S. spirits sold in those countries. The Distilled Spirits Council estimates that a 25% tariff on distilled spirits imports from Mexico and Canada could lead to a loss of more than 31,000 U.S. jobs. In 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, as well as $622 million worth of Canadian spirits, according to the association.
“Tariffs on spirits products from Canada and Mexico will jeopardize the industry’s contribution to the U.S. economy,” the group said in a statement. “The North American spirits sector is highly interconnected and, as a result, tariffs on tequila and Canadian whiskey will harm U.S. spirits companies that have these products in their brand portfolios.”
Trump has indicated that further tariffs will be on the way. He reiterated Monday that previously announced “reciprocal” tariffs would be coming April 2, and that tariffs on “external product” from the agriculture industry would also be imposed that day, without offering further details.
Last month, Trump imposed a 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the United States from all countries, and raised his 2018 aluminum tariffs from 10% to 25%, without exceptions or exemptions.
Trump has repeatedly cited tariffs as a tool he can use to raise revenue to pay for other domestic spending priorities and as a measure to pressure companies to relocate production to the U.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to Numerator, prices for everyday household purchases increased 0.12% in October, following a 0.60% increase in September and a 0.32% increase in August. In October, prices for everyday goods are up 2.68% versus a year ago.
Similar to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ published indices, the Numerator CPI tracks price changes over time and captures how consumer buying behavior evolves alongside them. The data cover approximately 20% of the consumption basket captured in the U.S. government’s CPI and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) indices, and closely track the PCE, offering a reliable signal of retail price changes experienced by U.S. consumers.
“We’re seeing inflation remain sticky in the data, particularly for everyday goods that define consumer spending,” said Eric Belcher, CEO, Numerator. “For financial institutions, policymakers, and economists, this provides a reliable, high-frequency view into how prices are moving across categories before official government data is released. Numerator’s inflation reporting gives researchers, analysts, and investors a head start in understanding pricing trends and consumer behavior shifts that impact the broader economy.”
Additional key findings from Numerator’s October CPI:
- Prices for everyday household goods increased 0.12% month over month in October, following a 0.60% increase in September and a 0.32% increase in August.
- Prices are up 2.68% year over year.
- Inflation has been accelerating since the beginning of the year.
“Our data confirm that consumers are facing higher prices at the grocery store and across household essentials,” said Paul Stanley, Senior Economist, Numerator.

METHODOLOGY:
Numerator’s consumer inflation measure is constructed using both base-period and current-period quantity weights to combine item prices, an approach that is consistent with the structure of the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis’ PCE Price Index.
The index is calculated from verified, item-level transactions provided by a panel of 200,000 geographically and demographically representative U.S. households. These data include purchases across categories such as grocery, household goods, and health and beauty. The data capture changes in consumer purchasing behavior when prices change, including brand switching, downsizing, and shifts in where consumers buy.
Values are aggregated monthly to produce index levels and month-over-month and year-over-year percent changes, providing a current view of inflation trends. The dataset uses verified household purchase data from the demand side, offering visibility into consumer behavior as prices evolve.
The Numerator CPI has a 0.96 correlation with the PCE Food and Beverage index over the overlapping sample period.
About Numerator:
Numerator is a data and tech company bringing speed and scale to market research. Numerator blends first-party data from over 1 million US households with advanced technology to provide 360-degree consumer understanding for the market research industry that has been slow to change.

2025 Second Quarter Summary
Released on July 31, 2025, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U.S. Employment Cost Index (ECI), which controls for occupational composition, reported in at 3.6 percent for the 12 months ending in June. This is flat with the 12-month current-dollar ECI reported in Q1. Important to note is that the Q2 US household Consumer Price Index (CPI) is 2.7 percent (all items index) for the 12 months ending June, 0.3 percentage points higher than the 12 months ending May. This year-on-year acceleration of inflation balanced against the flat 12-month ECI indicates a slight weakening of the purchasing power of employees’ pay growth since June 2024. (Chart 1, Table 1).
Total and Healthcare Benefits
Looking more closely at the pay and benefits components of compensation reveals interesting countervailing dynamics. The flat 12-month ECI between Q2 and Q1 is the result of notable deceleration (0.3 percentage points) for total benefits balanced by an acceleration in wages and salaries of 0.1 percentage points. (Wages and Salaries account for roughly 70% of employers’ costs for employee compensation.) After its tick up last quarter, the Q2 2025 12-month ECI for benefits has reverted to its downward trend. Q2 2025 recorded the softest year-on-year cost increase for employer-provided benefits since Q4 2021, returning to a consistent pattern below that of wages and salaries (Chart 2).
Within the private sector, employee benefits show a further dichotomy. The cost of total benefits provided to private sector employees rose even more slowly, year-on-year, than for the civilian workforce overall, 3.4 percent versus 3.5 percent, respectively. However, the costs of healthcare benefits continue their rapid acceleration, up 5.8 percent compared to a year ago. Approaching 6 percent, the 12-month ECI for private sector health insurance is moving into an inflationary range not seen for 20 years (Chart 3).
Union/Nonunion Differences
Unionized and nonunion workers’ compensation growth have converged now that the delayed union wage response to the pandemic-related spike in inflation (2021-2023) has largely passed. (Chart 4).
The pandemic-related spike in inflation was reflected much more rapidly in nonunion compensation than in unionized workers’ compensation, peaking in late 2021/early 2022 for nonunion workers. Because many multi-year collective bargaining agreements had little or no indexation for inflation, the inflation-related increases for union workers peaked almost two years later, as collective bargaining agreements were renegotiated. The pattern is most pronounced in wages and salaries.
Occupation differences
Looking at occupational groups separately shows that wage and salary growth for the past 12 months was unusually compressed. It also remains elevated compared to a decade ago (Chart 5).
It has been ten years since occupational groups’ wage and salary growth were so strongly compressed. Since 2015, management, professional and related occupations’ pay has lagged most of the other groups quite consistently. Sales and related occupations’ wage gains have been the most volatile, likely reflecting prevalence of incentive and commission pay for those employees. The two occupational groups with the most consistent pay gains relative to the other groups and to inflation have been service occupations (the lowest average wage group) and production, transportation and moving occupations. This suggests some moderation in wage inequality during the last decade.
The recent trend toward declining wage growth is clear for all occupation groups except sales and related workers, whose pay is the most volatile. Nevertheless, wage growth remains above the inflation rate, and almost two percentage points higher than in 2015.
Data Notes: The Employment Cost Index (ECI) is produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure trends in the costs of compensation paid by employers to their employees, free from the influence of employment shifts among occupations and industries. The ECI is one of the labor market indicators used by the Federal Reserve Board to monitor the effects of fiscal and monetary policies and is released quarterly with a one-month lag.
Data for the Q2 2025 reference period (the 3-months ending in June 2025) were collected from a probability sample of approximately 26,400 occupational observations selected from a sample of about 6,200 private industry establishments and approximately 7,400 occupational observations selected from a sample of about 1,400 state and local government establishments that provided data at the initial interview.

1. Explanatory Notes
Consumer Price Index (CPI) is an index measuring changes over time in the price level of consumer goods and services purchased by residents, which comprehensively reflects the changes of price level.
2. Statistical Coverage
Consumer Price Index (CPI) covers the prices of goods and services of 8 categories and 268 basic divisions which cover the living consumption of urban and rural residents, including food, tobacco and liquor; clothing; residence; household facilities, articles and services; transportation and telecommunication; education, culture and recreation; health care; miscellaneous goods and services.
3. Survey Methods
According to the principle of ""fixed person, fixed point and fixed time"", people are directly sent to the survey sites or collect the original price from the Internet. The data comes from about 500 cities and counties in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and cities) and nearly 100,000 price survey points, including shopping malls (stores), supermarkets, farmers' markets, service outlets and internet e-commerce.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 317.02 points, or 0.93%, to close at 34,261.42. The S&P 500 rose 0.67% to end at 4,439.26. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite gained 0.55% to 13,760.70.
Salesforce's stock rose nearly 4% after the company announced it would increase prices across the board in August. Activision Blizzard's shares jumped 10% after a federal judge denied the Federal Trade Commission's request for a preliminary injunction to stop Microsoft's acquisition of the video game company. The decision meant that the two companies were closer to completing their deal.
The June consumer price index report set for release Wednesday, as well as the June producer price index due out Thursday, will shed light on whether the decline in inflation has continued, and create the backdrop for future direction of interest rates. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect the index rose 3.1% last month on a year-over-year basis.
Investors have penciled in another quarter-point increase at the Federal Reserve's July 25-26 meeting. But they are undecided about what the central bank will do at its September meeting after last week's continued robust jobs data raised concern that policymakers will revert to raising rates following the June pause.
""I think [on Wednesday] you're going to see further evidence that the CPI-measured inflation is continuing its descent. And a lot of that was because of the impacts of Covid. But that's not good enough for the Fed. The Fed worries about there being [a] wage price spiral,"" said Brent Schutte, chief investment officer at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company.
""I think there's going to be a recession, because the Fed [will] keep going until they see the labor market crack and until wage [growth] goes well below 4%,"" Schutte continued.

But new federal data issued Friday suggests it may have hit a long-awaited wall.
""We're finally in the eye of the hurricane,"" Daniel Zhao, chief economist at career site Glassdoor, wrote in a note.
""After months of warning signs, the July jobs report confirms that the slowdown isn't just approaching — it's here,"" he wrote.
'Very soft' job market
Employers added just 73,000 jobs in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. That tally is less than expected.
Economists generally think the U.S. economy needs to add roughly 80,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with population growth, said Laura Ullrich, director of economic research for North America at job site Indeed.
The July figure suggests the job market isn't keeping pace with population growth — and is therefore contracting, she said.
Even more concerning than the July numbers: The job growth figures for May and June were much weaker than initially thought, economists said.
The BLS revised the job growth figures for those months sharply downward, to 19,000 jobs added in May (down from an initial 144,000) and 14,000 in June (from 147,000).
All told, employers added 258,000 fewer jobs than initially thought.
Such monthly revisions are typical as the BLS collects additional data from businesses and government agencies, but these adjustments were unusually large, economists said.
It's unclear why, they said.
""Really, it just shows a very soft job market,"" Ullrich said. ""It's not disastrous. Still, those are very weak job numbers,"" and not something one would expect in a strong economy, she said.
The numbers could be revised again in August, economists said.
Tariffs, other factors pose headwinds
Job growth has averaged 35,000 in the past three months, when accounting for the revised data. By contrast, job growth averaged 111,000 per month in the first three months of 2025.
New jobs have also largely been concentrated in the health care and social assistance sectors, meaning opportunities haven't been broad-based, economists said.
The data ""does tell a completely different story about the job market than what we were originally thinking,"" Glassdoor's Zhao said in an interview.
""We had been under the impression the job market was holding up surprisingly resiliently against economic headwinds like tariffs,"" he said.

Senate introduces bill for tariff rebate checks
President Donald Trump announced a spate of new tariffs on Thursday, putting fresh import duties on several trading partners ranging from 10% to 41%.
Tariffs are taxes that U.S. companies pay on items they import.
Tariffs, when kept in place for the long term, generally raise prices for consumers and pressure profits for many businesses by raising their input costs, economists said. Additionally, Trump's on-again-off-again approach to tariffs creates uncertainty for businesses, leading many to pull back on hiring, economists said.
The national hiring rate is around its lowest since 2014, outside of the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.
""It's hard for people to make a decision or change in the face of so much uncertainty,"" Ullrich said.
Tariff policy compounds other headwinds, such as immigration policy that has reduced the amount of available workers, cuts to the federal workforce and government spending, and higher interest rates, Zhao said.
'High degree of stagnation' in job market
There are other concerning signs in the U.S. job market, economists said.
For example, the labor force participation rate fell to its lowest level since 2022, Thomas Ryan, North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note Friday.
This is ""potentially further evidence of President Trump's immigration crackdown keeping undocumented migrants away from the labour market even though they remain in the country,"" he wrote.
The unemployment rate also rose to 4.2% in July, up from 4.1% in June, the BLS reported.
The share of unemployed Americans who are long-term unemployed — meaning they've been out of work for more than six months — has increased to nearly 25% from 21.6% since July 2024, the BLS said.
One silver lining for workers: Layoffs remain near historical lows.
However, an environment of low layoffs, hiring and quitting creates challenges for job seekers.
""There's a high degree of stagnation right now,"" Ullrich said. ""There's not a lot of movement in and out of jobs.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- Job growth from May and June was revised down, showing a much slower labor market than previously estimated.
The US economy added 73,000 jobs in July, missing the expected 106,000, and unemployment increased to 4.2%.
June's job growth was revised from 147,000 to 14,000, and May's job growth was revised from 144,000 to 19,000. The new report said these ""were larger than normal"" revisions, and there were 258,000 fewer jobs added than previously estimated over those two months.
Economists expected unemployment to tick back up from 4.1% to 4.2%, the same rate as between March and May. Unemployment has been consistently low, hovering between 4% and 4.2% since May 2024.
Labor force participation continued to decline, falling to 62.2% in July from 62.3%. The employment-population ratio also ticked down.
Marc Goldwein of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said in a post on X that ""all 73,000 new jobs in July were in health care and social services"" on net.
Employment rose by 55,400 in healthcare from June to July.
""Healthcare's steadiness stands in contrast to the rest of the job market, which has been more volatile over the last few years, and in particular has been very soft over the last few months,"" Daniel Zhao, the chief economist at Glassdoor, told Business Insider.
Laura Ullrich, the director of economic research in North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told BI that the job market continues to be in a low-hire, low-fire environment, especially in traditionally white-collar fields.
Professional and business services employment fell over the month in July, as did jobs figures in other sectors including manufacturing. Employment also fell by 12,000 in the federal government.
Average earnings rose from $35.07 an hour in July 2024 to $36.44 an hour, a 3.9% increase from a year ago. Year-over-year growth in average hourly earnings has been hovering between 3.8% and 3.9% since January. Earnings rose 0.3% over the month, compared to 0.2% in June.
The new Bureau of Labor Statistics report is just one of several economic releases this week. Data released on Wednesday showed real gross domestic product growth was hotter than expected in the second quarter after a decline in the first, largely due to a drop in imports and a bounce back in consumer spending. However, growth in the first half of the year overall was slower than in 2024, and tariffs bring more uncertainty to future economic growth.
""Even if the most extreme versions of the Liberation Day tariffs have not come to pass, the job market doesn't have a ton of altitude left in order to beat back some of these economic headwinds and still arrive at that soft landing,"" Zhao said.
The labor market as a whole is still in its ongoing slow but steady state. Data published Thursday showed initial claims for unemployment insurance, an indication of layoffs, are still low. Other data earlier this week showed that the job openings rate fell in June, while the quit rate was still low, at 2% for the third straight month. The Conference Board's July survey showed an uptick in the share of consumers who said jobs were plentiful, but also an uptick in people who said it's tough to get a job. Job seekers have told Business Insider they've broadened their job search so they can try to land a job.
""What you see is, by many many statistics, the labor market is kind of still in balance,"" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday.
Powell said there is downside risk because the job market is ""getting into balance due to declines in both supply and demand."" Further slowing could lead to an uptick in layoffs later this year.
The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for the fifth straight time earlier this week. More data will be published before the Fed's next decision. According to the CME FedWatch tool, which estimates probabilities for the Fed's future decisions based on market moves, the likelihood of a cut at the next scheduled Fed meeting in September shot up from around 40% before the jobs report to nearly 70%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

19,2025-04-21,98.279999,-0.011069,Comments about Fed Chair Powell's potential dismissal led to a 1.2% drop in the dollar within an hour. Trump questions Powell and Fed,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/economy/fed-governor-rate-cut-july,https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/20/economy/fed-governor-rate-cut-july,"President Donald Trump on Friday again demanded the Federal Reserve lower interest rates, insulting Fed Chair Jerome Powell in the process.
But this time, Trump added something new: an acknowledgement that his attacks actually make it harder for Powell to do so.
Trump called Powell a “numbskull” in a social media post, then added: “I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!”
The post came the same day that Christopher Waller, who serves on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, said the central bank should deliver interest rate cuts as soon as July.
The tension between Trump and the Fed – and now perhaps even within the Fed – underscores the uncertainty in the world’s biggest economy. While the predicted inflationary effects of broad tariffs have yet to materialize, economists say it’s still too early to declare victory. And Trump continues to worry businesses facing higher costs to import goods.
In an interview with CNBC, Waller said that the effects of Trump’s hefty tariffs will likely be limited and that central bankers should “look through these type of price shocks” because they’ll likely only result in a “one-off” increase in inflation.
“We’re in a good spot right now for talking about bringing the rate down,” Waller said.
He stopped short of calling for the supersized rate cuts Trump has demanded, saying that the Fed should “start slow.”
For months, Trump has blasted the Fed and Powell for not lowering rates quickly enough, saying the US central bank is lagging behind its European counterpart. He’s said the federal government is stuck making massive interest rate payments on its debt because the Fed hasn’t lowered borrowing costs.
But the Fed doesn’t consider the government’s finances when setting rates. As Powell laid out in a press conference this week following the central bank’s latest monetary policy meeting, the main reason the central bank hasn’t lowered rates is because it wants to see how Trump’s policies play out and how they ultimately affect the US economy. Recent speeches from other Fed officials confirm that approach.
The Fed is tasked by Congress to maximize employment and stabilize prices, its so-called dual mandate. So far, inflation has been tame — not yet boosted by Trump’s tariffs, although many economists anticipate a coming surge — and the labor market remains in decent shape.
Waller, however, said there have been signs of the job market cracking, such as elevated youth unemployment, making the case for imminent rate cuts, especially considering that inflation hasn’t gone up yet.
Is Waller trying to get in Trump’s good graces?
Waller’s latest comments come as Trump is actively considering who Powell’s successor will be.
Last week, Trump said he will announce his pick for Fed chair “very soon,” well in advance of May 2026, when Powell’s term ends. Trump’s disdain for Powell stretches back to his first term as president, all centered on Powell’s refusal to acquiesce to Trump’s demands for lower rates.
Powell frequently stresses that the Fed’s decisions are solely based on what economic figures show.
With Powell’s term ending in less than a year, there are now at least three contenders for the top job at the Fed: Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor; Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent; and Waller, a current Fed governor who was appointed to his current role by Trump in 2020.
Assuming Trump makes an announcement well ahead of next May, Trump’s pick will be known as the “shadow” Fed chair, an unprecedented development in the Fed’s history, scholars in monetary policy tell CNN. US presidents have historically waited to name a successor until the final months of the existing Fed chair’s term.
On Friday, Trump hinted a new Fed chair could be coming sooner rather than later.
“Maybe, just maybe, I’ll have to change my mind about firing him? But regardless, his Term ends shortly!” he said.
Waller’s view of the labor market
The health and future of the labor market is a key variable for Fed officials when thinking about rate cuts. That’s because a drop-off in hiring and an uptick in unemployment could move the needle for the Fed to finally lower rates, even if there’s an increase in inflation because of tariffs.
“The labor market is okay, but it’s not strong like it was in 2022,” Waller said. That means higher inflation likely won’t become entrenched because workers won’t have the leverage to demand higher wages to offset price increases — what Waller referred to as “second-round effects.”
Other Fed officials have similarly said the labor market has gradually lost steam over the past two years, but is holding up. Unemployment has remained below 4.2%, a historically low level, since October 2021 and employers have continued to pump out jobs in recent months.
However, unlike other Fed officials, Waller wants to preemptively lower rates to prevent a deteriorating labor market.
“Maybe the labor market is starting to soften more than we might want it to… so you’re starting to worry about the downside risks to the labor market,” Waller said. “Move now, don’t wait.”
“Why do we want to wait until we actually see a crash before we start cutting rates?” he added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But this time, Trump added something new: an acknowledgement that his attacks actually make it harder for Powell to do so.
Trump called Powell a “numbskull” in a social media post, then added: “I fully understand that my strong criticism of him makes it more difficult for him to do what he should be doing, lowering Rates, but I’ve tried it all different ways. I’ve been nice, I’ve been neutral, and I’ve been nasty, and nice and neutral didn’t work!”
The post came the same day that Christopher Waller, who serves on the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, said the central bank should deliver interest rate cuts as soon as July.
The tension between Trump and the Fed – and now perhaps even within the Fed – underscores the uncertainty in the world’s biggest economy. While the predicted inflationary effects of broad tariffs have yet to materialize, economists say it’s still too early to declare victory. And Trump continues to worry businesses facing higher costs to import goods.
In an interview with CNBC, Waller said that the effects of Trump’s hefty tariffs will likely be limited and that central bankers should “look through these type of price shocks” because they’ll likely only result in a “one-off” increase in inflation.
“We’re in a good spot right now for talking about bringing the rate down,” Waller said.
He stopped short of calling for the supersized rate cuts Trump has demanded, saying that the Fed should “start slow.”
For months, Trump has blasted the Fed and Powell for not lowering rates quickly enough, saying the US central bank is lagging behind its European counterpart. He’s said the federal government is stuck making massive interest rate payments on its debt because the Fed hasn’t lowered borrowing costs.
But the Fed doesn’t consider the government’s finances when setting rates. As Powell laid out in a press conference this week following the central bank’s latest monetary policy meeting, the main reason the central bank hasn’t lowered rates is because it wants to see how Trump’s policies play out and how they ultimately affect the US economy. Recent speeches from other Fed officials confirm that approach.
The Fed is tasked by Congress to maximize employment and stabilize prices, its so-called dual mandate. So far, inflation has been tame — not yet boosted by Trump’s tariffs, although many economists anticipate a coming surge — and the labor market remains in decent shape.
Waller, however, said there have been signs of the job market cracking, such as elevated youth unemployment, making the case for imminent rate cuts, especially considering that inflation hasn’t gone up yet.
Is Waller trying to get in Trump’s good graces?
Waller’s latest comments come as Trump is actively considering who Powell’s successor will be.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 339.69 points, or 1.02%, to 32,930.08. It was weighed down by Walgreens, which lost 6.13% after earnings showed a $5.2 billion opioid litigation settlement drove a quarterly loss.
The S&P 500 shed 1.16% to close at 3,808.10 and the Nasdaq Composite slipped 1.47% to 10,305.24. Bed, Bath & Beyond shed 29.88% after saying its short on cash and considering bankruptcy, and crypto-friendly bank Silvergate Capital plummeted 42.73% after it disclosed major customer withdrawals. All three averages are on track to notch five weeks of losses
Stocks rose from lows of the day in the afternoon but remained down when St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said that 2023 may be a disinflationary year in a speech. He also noted that while current policy isn't ""sufficiently restrictive,"" it's moving in that direction and should reach it this year.
Stocks opened lower after the ADP private payrolls report showed that employers added 235,000 jobs in December, well above economist estimates. Wages also increased more than anticipated, another sign that the labor market remains hot. Later in the morning, weekly jobless claims came in below expectations and showed a drop in continuing claims.
""While we will get a better overall picture of the jobs market tomorrow, private payrolls beating expectations and jobless claims coming in below are indications that the labor market remains resilient,"" said Mike Loewengart of Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office.
""These come on the heels of big-name companies announcing sizable job cuts so there is no doubt the market's pressures are weighing on companies, but it remains to be seen when hiring will slow demonstrably,"" he added.
On Friday, investors will review the December jobs report for updated data on employment and hourly wages. Economists estimate that U.S. employers added some 200,000 jobs in December, which would represent a moderate slowdown from gains in the previous month.
A higher number would be further bad news to the Fed that the labor market is still strong. In addition, investors don't want to see big gains in wage growth, which could signal higher inflation.

The interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.S. is expected to drop to 5.25% by the end of this year, according to a forecast by the financial services website Bankrate. That's 1.49 percentage points lower than the current rate, and nearly two percentage points lower than 2022's peak rate of 7.12%.
A slowing economy could lead to lower mortgage rates
The forecast reflects expectations of a slowing economy in 2023 as the Federal Reserve continues to increase its benchmark interest rate to combat high inflation.
While the Fed has made progress reducing inflation — from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June to 7.1% as of December — it's still nowhere near the Fed's target rate of 2%. For that reason, Fed officials expect rate hikes to continue in early 2023, according to Bankrate.
While rate hikes can reduce inflation by making it more expensive to borrow money, they also discourage investment. This can shrink the economy, and perhaps trigger a recession in which many people lose their jobs.
And since mortgage interest rates are largely influenced by the overall state of the economy, they typically decrease during a recession.
""With the Fed maintaining an aggressive posture and inflation still high, mortgage rates will roller coaster up and down during the first half of the year before a more substantive slide takes hold in the back half of 2023,"" says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, who predicts a ""notable pullback"" on mortgage rates as inflation trends lower.
A drop in mortgage rates would be positive news for potential homebuyers, as it will reduce their monthly homeownership costs.
However, the projected dip in mortgage rates won't be anything like pre-pandemic lows, and a chronic undersupply of homes will keep prices high, so many potential homeowners will remain on the ""sidelines"" in 2023, says McBride.
