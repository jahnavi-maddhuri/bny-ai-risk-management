The solution integrates MSCI private capital data with Moody’s EDF-X credit risk modelling tool.
MSCI said the new solution leverages consistent, independent probability of default (PD) scores and implied ratings for deeper risk insight across funds, sectors and geographies.
It also delivers credible, transparent credit risk metrics to boards, regulators and investors and support decision-making with insights backed by the independent methodologies, MSCI said.
The two firms said the solution “will be distinct from the services provided by Moody’s Ratings, the credit rating agency, to the issuers in the private credit market.”
MSCI is supplying data on more than 2800 private credit funds and 14,000 underlying companies.
The solution will also produce early warning signals that flag potential credit deterioration, macro-adjusted PDs incorporating both climate and economic factors, and loss given defaults at the facility level.
“As the private credit market evolves, investors are looking for trusted independent assessments to help benchmark credit risk and inform investments and monitor portfolios,” Moody’s chief executive Rob Fauber said.
“Our partnership with MSCI will play a critical role in providing these insights, helping market participants make informed decisions.”
MSCI chief executive Henry A. Fernandez said the rapid growth of private credit continues to transform the global investment landscape while highlighting the need for increased transparency, consistent standards and independent risk assessment.

BNY has successfully piloted the first intraday repo trade settled through its triparty infrastructure.
The transaction took place between UBS and Swiss Re in February, where UBS borrowed cash from Swiss Re while delivering collateral through BNY's platform.
BNY says that the successful transaction marks the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo, where the allocation and return of collateral will be settled intraday against payment.
The tri-party solution also allows firms such as UBS to source liquidity at a specified time, without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period.
Gesa Johannsen, BNY's executive platform owner, global collateral, says: ""Our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
Jason Crosskey, head of EMEA funding and optimisation solutions at UBS, adds: “This facility enhances intraday capabilities by allowing institutions to provide or access cash at specific times to better manage liquidity.”

eToro is working with BNY, which will act as the custodian, and stock lending platform EquiLend, which will identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+ and Diamond Club members, followed at a later date by lower-tier Club members.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way. Yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets. Leveraging BNY’s Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,” said Yossi Brandes, VP Execution Services at eToro.
Eligible eToro users will be given the option to opt into the programme, at which point their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending. Once opted in, they will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earned in the specific period.
Only whole unit ‘real’ stock positions are eligible for lending, meaning that CFDs and fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share. Stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
eToro users who lend their stock temporarily give ownership of the stocks to the borrower and lose voting rights while the stock is on loan. However, they can still receive dividends, sell the stocks or opt out of the programme at any time at no cost.
This launch of stock lending represents an expansion of the growing clearing relationship between eToro and BNY which leverages BNY’s Global Clearing platform, offering integrated solutions across US and international clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing. Through a jointly-created value proposition, the firms have developed a scalable global operating model enabling eToro’s underlying client base to access over 19 exchanges globally.
Yossi Brandes adds: “Since the inception of our relationship, BNY has enabled us to expand our offering of investment opportunities through their global clearing and custody services, which provide the financial structure for our global, fully funded stock and ETF offerings across 19 exchanges. This new collaboration marks a significant step in our commitment to adding features and products to the platform that enrich the investing experience and help users to grow their knowledge and wealth.”
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with eToro, supporting a holistic solution set across clearing, settlement, custody, foreign exchange, cash management. This development represents the very best of eToro, Equilend and the heritage and innovation of BNY’s world-class platform, as investors look to access a cutting edge feature in their investing journey,” said Victor O’Laughlen, Head of Global Clearing at BNY.
“The collaboration between EquiLend Spire and eToro marks a significant advancement in the securities lending market, enabling eToro to enhance its services with a fully paid lending program that benefits from cutting-edge technology. This move not only demonstrates EquiLend Spire’s commitment to innovation but also eToro’s dedication to providing efficient and modern financial solutions to its users,” said Dan Dougherty, Managing Director, Global Head of Sales & Account Management at EquiLend.

Notes to editors
The fully paid stock lending programme is only available to eToro users based in Europe and the UK. To help users better understand the programme, users can find out how much income they could potentially earn as well as the associated risks from lending their stocks on the homepage when they log onto the platform.
Public guidance from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) states that while securities lending may bring the benefit of generating extra returns on financial instruments, they can also bring additional risks, such as counterparty and collateral shortfall risk.

A foster parent and shelter worker, respectively, the pair attended the Carnegie Science Center’s Paws and Claws 21+ Night on Friday, April 11, to meet local animals in need of homes.
But by a little after 7 p.m., they’d traded barks and meows for mechanical whirs. Standing at a computer terminal, they designed a metal tag fit for a collar. With the push of a few buttons, the laser engraver to their left came to life, etching a design into a small metal round.
“It was faster than I imagined it was going to take,” Selva says.
“I’ve never etched before in my life — the guy had to repeat to us six or seven times how to do it. At 67 years old, I figure a few more dozen times, I would’ve been a pro at it.”
Selva and Prosek designed their tag in the science center’s new BNY Fab Lab in the third-floor space that was previously home to the Kitchen Theater.
The design and fabrication space houses laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) routers, desktop computers and even laptops for an overflow of designers. Renovations and the almost entirely new equipment were funded through a $1 million donation from financial services company BNY.
The Paws and Claws event was the first time the Fab Lab was open for a 21+ Night following its March 28, unveiling.
Even though the makerspace has been part of the science center’s programming for almost 10 years, you wouldn’t be alone if you haven’t stumbled upon it. Director Jason Brown calls its previous home in SportsWorks classrooms “off the beaten path.”
“While it was a great place for workshops that you could sign up for in advance and be directed to, it wasn’t the kind of place that was conducive to … popping in,” he says. “Its new location is right on the ramps. It’s behind a giant glass wall that can slide completely open, so everyone who walks on the ramps will pass right by it.”
Access to the Fab Lab is included in regular science center admission with no registration required. Courses and workshops do require additional tickets, which can be purchased through the science center’s website.
Brown wants patrons of all ages to pop in, digitally create their ideas and test out their designs — the same principles as a real manufacturing process called “rapid prototyping.”
“Before there were Fab Labs, and before there were things like 3D printers and laser cutters, if someone had a dream for an idea, they would have to design it and then probably draw it out and manually create it,” Brown says.
“The amazing thing about a Fab Lab is that you’ve already got the design created, so if it doesn’t work, you can make a quick tweak … and then, with the laser cutter, I can cut those things out in 15 seconds.”
In concept, the science center’s Fab Lab is not unique. When it originally opened in 2015, it was with grant support from the Fab Foundation — a nonprofit that supports the creation of Fab Labs nationwide. But Brown says the science center received a bunch of equipment with little guidance on teaching curriculum or methodology to use alongside it.
“That,” he says, “is what that team has really done: They built an entire philosophy around the equipment.”
“There are many makerspaces — many schools and community centers have makerspaces — but what sets ours apart is that it’s not about coming in and … downloading a design and then printing it. It’s about doing it yourself. How do I use this technology to answer questions that I have? Solve problems that I have?”
Like Selva and Prosek, Cianna Kisailus and her mother Holly also attended Paws and Claws night for the animals, but found themselves etching tags.
“A cat that we had passed away … from cancer, so we both made tags for her to put on a chain from us,” Holly says.
Cianna swiftly moved through heart-shaped designs for their late cat Oreo, a green bone with a pawprint for Holly’s dog Bandit and a circular tag for her current cat.
“Her name’s Zoe,” Cianna interjects. “She’s not little — she’s a chunky tabby, but she’s a good girl.”
The mother and daughter had both had brief encounters with 3D printing in the past, but never laser cutters. Still, Holly left the designing to her daughter.
“She’s the tech person,” she says.
“I picked up on it really quickly,” Cianna says. “There weren’t too many choices where you got flustered.”
“But now they’re done and they’re beautiful.”",361,4410,2025-04-16

- BNY is calling employees back to the office four days a week starting in September, the bank said in a Wednesday memo seen by Reuters.
- The New York-based bank, which has required employees to spend three days a week in office since the first half of 2023, is instituting the change beginning Sept. 2. BNY managers have been in-office four days per week since January.
- The bank, which has 51,000 employees, will continue to allow remote work one day a week, the memo said. “We have no plans to return to 5 days in office unless circumstances were to demand otherwise.” A spokesperson declined to comment but confirmed what Reuters reported.
Dive Insight:
BNY is the latest Wall Street bank seeking to pull workers back to the office more frequently, five years since the COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread remote work.
In January, JPMorgan Chase joined Goldman Sachs in requiring workers to return to the office five days per week beginning in March, which drew complaints. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been among the biggest proponents of in-office work, saying in 2023 “there’s nothing like face-to-face.”
Last year, Citi, U.S. Bank, Truist, Deutsche Bank and Barclays were among those that upped the number of days employees needed to be in office. Most CEOs expect a full return to in-office work by 2027, according to KPMG.
“Being in the office together helps us collaborate and move work forward more efficiently. Occasional remote work can be effective, but in person we can respond more quickly to dynamic, fast-paced financial markets and better serve our clients,” BNY said in the memo to employees, noting it’s seen “positive momentum” from most managers being in office four days a week.
The bank will also continue offering employees two weeks of “work from anywhere” per year.",197,1810,2025-05-01

The pilot demonstrated the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo with a specified start and end time through BNY’s triparty platform – whereby the allocation and return of eligible collateral is settled and matured intraday against payment.
“We are continuously evolving BNY’s platform infrastructure to unlock new trading patterns for the market,” said Gesa Johannsen, executive platform owner, global collateral, BNY. “Complementing our new early morning maturity option for triparty transactions in the US, our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
The intraday repo solution is designed to enable market participants to source liquidity for specified periods of time without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period. For lenders, such as Swiss Re in this case, the solution can provide an opportunity to generate additional income on excess, idle cash.
Richard Hochreutiner, head of global collateral at Swiss Re, said: “This is a great way to deploy any otherwise dormant intraday cash and to contribute to market liquidity. Using BNY’s platform seamlessly builds on existing infrastructure and documentation.”
In April, Banco Santander and Rabobank also completed an intraday triparty repo transaction, executing trades in both directions — borrowing and lending — through BNY’s collateral platform.
In March, the custodian also announced a partnership with GLMX to enable buy-side clients to direct repo trades at the point of execution to BNY Mellon’s triparty platform.
The two firms said the integration comes off the back of growing demand from clients seeking to expand their BNY Mellon triparty usage beyond uncleared margin into repo financing, helping them to capture more benefits from being on the collateral platform.",415,2122,2025-04-09

The agency has made improvements to its IT security, Hood said, adding that the OCC is taking stock of “the extent to which highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions was compromised.”
Meanwhile, several large banks are limiting the information they share with the agency.
JPMorgan Chase has put a hold on sharing information electronically with the OCC, a source familiar with the matter told Banking Dive. The bank is ensuring that it’s communicating with its regulators safely, according to the source.
BNY has also paused sharing information over security concerns, sources told Bloomberg; as has Bank of America, sources told The Wall Street Journal.
Not all banks are limiting their info sharing. Citi, for one, hasn’t moved to do so, as it wasn’t in its practice to share classified information via email, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Citi declined to comment to Banking Dive, as did BNY. Bank of America did not return a request for comment.
The OCC will inform each regulated institution if the hackers accessed information specific to their company, Hood wrote. The agency will also provide all institutions with email addresses that were included in the compromised information so they can determine what information was shared with the OCC during the time frame the breach occurred.
The OCC is partnering with Microsoft Global Hunting Oversight and Strategic Triage, as well as cybersecurity firms Mandiant and CrowdStrike, to perform a full investigation relating to the incident. The agency has globally reset all credentials associated with its Microsoft tenant to eliminate further threat by the same hacker, Hood wrote.
During an internal review, the OCC found that hackers accessed sensitive information, Hood wrote. The OCC then determined the breach qualified as a “major incident” under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, meaning its either likely to “result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or the economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.”
The OCC learned Feb. 12 that an unauthorized user accessed a number of agency email accounts and activated incident response protocols, it said. The agency notified the public Feb. 26.
Hackers gained access to more than 100 email accounts and roughly 150,000 emails from May 2023 until February, including the mailboxes of senior deputy comptrollers and international banking supervisors, Bloomberg reported April 8, citing a draft letter to Congress.",348,2879,2025-04-16

Insight | 2025-04-18
16 minute read
Over the past two years since the emergence of large language models (LLMs) as the foundation for generative AI, the pace of progress has accelerated rapidly. In particular, AI agents capable of autonomously executing tasks based on generative AI have garnered increasing attention. These autonomous AI agents integrate generative AI with traditional AI technologies, offering flexible and advanced capabilities. As a result, AI agents can now handle complex tasks and meet a wide range of user needs.
On the other hand, the financial sector has a strong affinity with AI in both tasks that require language processing and tasks that involve data processing, such as analyzing vast amounts of transaction data. Currently, the financial services industry, which continues to undergo transformation through AI, is entering an era of change defined not just by generative AI, but also by AI agents.
This article will explore the structure and functionality of AI agents, examining their impact on the financial industry and how human-AI agent collaboration is shaping the future of financial services.
1．What are AI agents?
There are various definitions of AI agents, but simply put, an AI agent is a digital system capable of interacting independently within a dynamic environment. While such systems existed even before the advent of large language models (LLMs), AI agent systems based on generative AI (LLM-based) can understand given goals and contexts, create their own action plans, and use online tools and data to complete tasks. Furthermore, these agents can collaborate with other agents and humans, learn, and improve their performance through memory. In other words, AI agents consist of not only LLMs but also components such as database access, API integration, rule-based engines (traditional AI), and interfaces with external systems(1).
Figure 1 illustrates a conceptual diagram showing the differences in workflows between generative AI (LLM) and AI agents. With generative AI, humans are typically involved in the workflow, directly influencing the AI system's decisions and tasks. On the other hand, AI agents can autonomously complete the tasks assigned to them, with humans serving a supervisory role, intervening only when anomalies or unexpected situations arise. However, it’s important to understand that inference models like OpenAI-o1 can autonomously perform tasks that require multiple steps from a single prompt, making a direct comparison with AI agents difficult and highlighting that this is an evolutionary process.
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
The AI agents discussed so far are based on single-agent systems, which are designed to perform tasks or workflows for small teams or organizations. However, when it comes to complex workflows in larger organizations or ecosystems, single-agent systems have their limitations. This is because large-scale organizations and different domains require unique knowledge and workflows. To address this challenge, the concept of a ""Multi-Agent System (MAS)"" has been proposed.
MAS allows multiple agents to interact and share information, enabling them to handle tasks that span across multiple domains more efficiently. Additionally, through interactions between agents, collective intelligence and emergent solutions can be created, much like how humans collaborate.
When a multi-agent system is viewed as a set of single functions or attributes (refer to Figure 2), the AI agents dynamically construct a system to achieve the given task and its goals. The main functions and attributes are as follows:
１）Planning: Systematically designing and coordinating the necessary actions or tasks to achieve the goal.
２）Scalability: The AI effectively leverages external tools and resources (such as databases, APIs, specific software, etc.) to expand its capabilities.
3)Enrichment: Utilizing diverse data in various contexts to gain insights from multiple perspectives.
4)Connectivity: Multiple AI agents collaborate, sharing information and dividing tasks to address complex problems and large-scale projects.
5)Proactivity: Deciding what task to take on next, solving non-obvious tasks, and expanding knowledge to help the agent grow.
6)Adaptability: Continuously updating by incorporating basic information and changes in dynamic data.
Extending and Resolving Issues with LLMs
In addition to the core functions of AI agents discussed earlier, LLMs can be extended and their issues mitigated by integrating memory mechanisms, accessing external tools and information sources, and interacting with the environment.
(1) Memory and Context Retention
While LLMs are stateless and do not remember past interactions, AI agents typically incorporate memory mechanisms, allowing them to store past interactions and maintain consistency and continuity over long-term engagement. By leveraging past context, agents can improve future responses and enhance the user experience.
(2) Enhanced Functionality through Asynchronous and Parallel Processing
LLMs process inputs synchronously and sequentially, but AI agents can handle multiple tasks simultaneously and operate asynchronously. This allows agents to manage real-time interactions more effectively, improving efficiency and responsiveness when handling multiple queries or tasks at once.
(3) Fact-Checking and Real-Time Information Access
AI agents can mitigate the ""hallucination"" problem and incorrect outputs of LLMs by performing real-time data validation and integrating with external tools (such as databases, web APIs, or the internet). This is particularly valuable in applications where up-to-date and accurate information is crucial. Furthermore, by interfacing with specialized mathematical engines or software, agents can perform precise mathematical calculations, which enhances their utility in technical and scientific fields.
2. AI Agents in Financial Services: Impact, Use Cases, and Early Adoptions
Today’s financial industry faces challenges such as difficulty in securing talent and decreased productivity due to frequent task switching, all within an environment of fierce competition. Financial institutions are not only seeking systems that can perform tasks but also ones that can analyze risks, predict market changes, and make accurate, risk-informed decisions. Autonomous AI agents, equipped with vast knowledge and high expertise, have the potential to turn these challenges into opportunities.
Benefits of Utilizing AI Agents
By implementing AI agents, financial institutions and market participants can enhance workflow optimization, improve customer experiences, drive innovation in services and business models, strengthen compliance, and improve decision-making, all of which can help them achieve a competitive edge.
The benefits of utilizing AI agents in the financial services industry can be summarized in the following four points:
1)Streamlining Operations By automating repetitive tasks such as data entry, compliance checks, and transaction processing, AI agents enhance productivity, reduce human errors, and enable employees to focus on more strategic tasks.
2)Enhancing Customer Interactions AI agents provide highly personalized experiences for customers. These agents help individuals manage their finances, make optimal decisions, and adjust strategies based on personal goals and risk levels, empowering users like never before.
3)Driving Innovation AI agents enable the creation of new financial tools, such as personalized robo-advisors and adaptive asset management systems, that can adjust strategies in real time based on market changes and customer preferences.
4)Improving Risk Management and Compliance AI agents enhance real-time risk assessments, monitor suspicious transactions, and dynamically respond to emerging threats and anomalies. They also streamline compliance by automating regulatory reporting and ensuring adherence to complex financial regulations.
Use Cases of AI Agents in Financial Services
Financial services span multiple domains, including banking, insurance, securities, asset management, and credit card services. The development of AI agent use cases in these areas is progressing, with some use cases being applicable across multiple domains and others being specific to particular sectors. Table 1 below shows the primary use cases expected for four common functional areas across financial institutions.
Our research indicates that the use of generative AI in the financial industry is currently limited to specific tasks such as customer support and knowledge acquisition, leading to improvements in operational efficiency. However, its application to core business functions has been slow. This delay can be attributed to several factors, including technical challenges in implementing generative AI, inaccuracies in output caused by the model's hallucination issues, concerns about data security, and the difficulty of evaluating return on investment. However, the advantages of AI agents, such as memory retention, context awareness, enhanced asynchronous and parallel processing, fact-checking, and access to real-time information, can be leveraged to expand their use in core financial services operations.
Early Adoptions of AI Agents in Financial Services
AI agents are leading the digital transformation in the financial industry. Evolving from traditional rule-based AI to large language model (LLM)-based generative AI, they are at the forefront of change. While the financial sector is still in the learning phase, several early-use cases have been successfully implemented. Below are three such examples.
Moody’s – Financial Analysis Agent
Moody’s developed 35 agents, including specialized AI agents for tasks like project management, and integrated them into a ""multi-agent system"" where they collaborate with supervising agents(2). This system is used to analyze SEC filings and industry data, enhancing their research capabilities. The AI agents are specialized in specific tasks, and by having other agents verify the results, they can efficiently execute complex workflows.
Auquan – Financial Industry-Specific Digital Analyst
The automation of analyst tasks using AI agents is progressing. The startup Auquan developed an AI agent that specializes in creating financial industry reports, which is different from OpenAI's ""Deep Research,"" designed for general purposes(3). For example, it collects and analyzes financial data (including unstructured data such as presentations and PDFs) and internet information to generate reports. This method is 80–90% cheaper and significantly more productive than manual report generation. Clients include MetLife, UBS, and Capital Group. Auquan has announced plans to extend its AI solutions to risk management, compliance, and sustainability workflows, and it is believed that these are now being implemented.
Capital One – Chat Concierge Agent
Capital One has introduced a chat concierge that uses multiple AI agents to comprehensively address customer inquiries related to car purchases(4). The concierge supports the entire purchase process, from vehicle comparison to test-drive reservations, easing the customer's burden. With a customized Llama AI-based model, it responds instantly to customer questions and can perform multiple tasks at once, such as providing trade-in estimates and setting appointments with sales representatives.
BNY– The Approach to Multi-Agent Systems
BNY has implemented a multi-agent system that includes 13 specialized agents, providing sales representatives with lead generation and recommendations through AI agents. The AI tool ""Eliza"" quickly understands client needs, improving sales efficiency, while multiple agents collaborate to produce the best outcomes(5). In addition, through a partnership with OpenAI, BNY is integrating new features into Eliza via an API, enabling the resolution of complex tasks and the acquisition of insights. By leveraging cutting-edge reasoning models and agent functions (Deep Research, Operator), BNY expects to enhance Eliza's accuracy and autonomy(6).
Summary
The use cases of AI agents in the financial industry, as demonstrated by the above examples, are currently limited to market trend intelligence analysis, extracting information from messy metadata, addressing complex customer needs, and managing compliance. However, the development of use cases and the evolution of related technologies are progressing steadily. For example, Fujitsu has developed technologies such as risk-response agents(7) and meeting agents(8), working with internal teams and financial institution clients to assess the impact of AI agents on operations and explore the optimal process for their implementation.
3. A Vision for the Future of Financial Services: Human-AI Agent Collaboration
Building on the discussions thus far, the evolution of AI’s natural language understanding is making human-machine interactions increasingly intuitive and flexible. Against this backdrop, we can envision a future where AI agents autonomously execute business processes, driving the transformation of financial services. However, the introduction of AI agent systems also brings potential challenges, such as an increase in systemic risks and volatility in financial markets, disruptions in the labor market, and the emergence of new security risks. Additionally, ethical and privacy concerns, as well as the opacity of outcomes resulting from autonomous decision-making, are important considerations. Therefore, it is essential to balance the pursuit of AI agent autonomy in financial services with addressing the challenges that arise from it.
In reality, the role of humans in financial services will need to be redefined in the age of AI agents. Specifically, the role of humans will shift from being ""operators"" of daily tasks to ""orchestrators"" who oversee and adjust AI systems. Humans will monitor the progress of business operations and intervene or adjust when necessary. As advancements are made in areas like improved reasoning abilities, hallucination mitigation, and the reduction of ethical and privacy risks, human intervention will gradually become minimal. Furthermore, humans are expected to focus more on creative tasks that leverage their emotional intelligence, cognitive skills, and physical dexterity, working in collaboration with AI to expand these capabilities.
The rapid innovation of AI agent technology requires the financial services industry to set value-driven goals, enhance the necessary skills and capabilities, and establish a robust governance framework that includes change management and risk management. By making these preparations, we can realize a future in which humans and AI agents work together to shape the financial services of tomorrow.

While BlackRock has leaned into tokenization with its BUIDL tokenized treasury fund issued on permissionless blockchains via Securitize, the target market (for now) is primarily crypto institutions. Stablecoin and tokenized money market fund (MMF) issuers are the primary BUIDL token holders.
By contrast, BNY Mellon primarily services mainstream traditional finance (TradFI) institutions as the world’s largest global custodian and a major tri-party agent. However, it also provides custody and cash management solutions for stablecoin issuer Circle, which is also now in the tokenized money market fund business following the acquisition of Hashnote.

The financial institution has designed a platform that bridges digital and traditional assets. BNY’s initial focus is on using the power of blockchain and asset tokenization technology to drive operational efficiency, mobility of assets, transparency and real-time access to data.
BNY’s platform will integrate off-chain and on-chain data to streamline reporting, monitoring, and servicing capabilities across blockchains.
Last September, Bloomberg reported how BNY is moving closer to rolling out custody services for the bitcoin and ETH held in Exchange Traded Products or ETPs. At the time the SEC’s SAB 121 was still in place. The SAB 121 rule had forced banks to classify crypto as liabilities.
BNY has been developing digital assets custody services since before October 2022, but only now, with the SAB 121 rule removed, can financial institutions act for their clients.
BlackRock Chooses BNY’s New Blockchain Accounting Tool
Larry Fink was bullish about digital assets in his annual letter this week. He compared the SWIFT payment system to the postal service, and tokenization to how email has disrupted sending letters in the post.
“Every stock, every bond, every fund – every asset – can be tokenized. If they are. It will revolutionize investing.” Fink stated in the report. He is championing tokenization having watched the BlackRock Bitcoin ETP do so well since it was launched.
Shortly after Fink’s letter was made public, Fortune broke a story about BNY’s announcement of its latest crypto offering.
BNY’s new tool provides up-to-date data about a fund’s net asset value, directly on a blockchain. BNY’s Head of Digital Assets, Caroline Butler, told Fortune that “because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this.”
BlackRock is reported to be the first client for BNY’s new platform. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets confirmed the story in a statement to Fortune.

Fabian Khoshbakht, head of treasury services for Asia Pacific (APAC) and global head of client insight and innovation for treasury services explained that under the new model, treasury services is less siloed. “By simplifying, streamlining and collaborating through cross-functional teams, we create more intuitive client journeys and improve our ability to anticipate unmet needs.” He acknowledged that the transformation is still in progress but said it has already led to greater agility and a new culture of commerciality. “We are going to market much faster, because of how the platform’s operating model has enabled teams to deliver goals using agile ways.” Khoshbakht explained that the change is more than operational. “We are an enabler,” he said. “Leveraging our infrastructure, data and insights—we are empowering our clients to solve their business challenges.” This is particularly significant in Asia Pacific, where financial institutions (FIs) operate in diverse markets with varying regulatory, technological and competitive landscapes. BNY’s ability to deliver global consistency while adapting to local client needs will be critical to supporting APAC clients in the long run. Expanding payments and liquidity access for FIs in APAC BNY’s institutional payments business in APAC is evolving alongside client demand for faster, more reliable and more transparent cross-border infrastructure. The bank supports over 2,000 FIs globally and processes $2.5 trillion in payments value each day, and over 100 currencies served in foreign exchange (FX) payments. This infrastructure enables regional and local FIs to access dollar clearing, improve operational predictability and broaden corridor coverage. Jonathan Hickey, market manager for payments product, described BNY’s payment franchise as one of scale and neutrality. “We do not serve retail or corporate clients for transaction banking in APAC, and that is important,” he said. “We do not compete with our clients for their end customers; we enable our clients to support their customers.” He positioned BNY’s payments infrastructure as a platform that enables other FIs to scale globally and optimise performance without conflict. “We enable our clients to scale and adapt without having to build everything themselves.” Hickey also detailed how this strategy plays out across APAC corridors. He highlighted a collaboration with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) to deliver near real-time inbound payments into Australia. “The solution allows BNY’s global clients to have funds received in under 60 seconds by Australian beneficiaries, regardless of the bank in which the beneficiary uses domestically,” he said. “We handle the inbound transaction and connect to the real-time payment rails in Australia.” Fabian Khoshbakht, head of treasury services for Asia Pacific (APAC) and global head of client insight and innovation for treasury services at BNY Jonathan Hickey, market manager for payments product at BNY BNY is also collaborating with the National Australia Bank (NAB) to enhance its cross-border service for payments into Australia through NAB’s real-time payments solution. Carl Slabicki, executive platform owner for treasury services at BNY, said, “This [collaboration] improves the customer experience by offering more convenient and transparent transactions and provides a competitive advantage in the market.” In Korea, BNY worked with iM Bank, formerly Daegu Bank, to activate a SWIFT Go to automated clearing house (ACH) capability. “We built a service that allowed them to send low-value cross-border payments, which we then convert into local ACH batches. That made it viable for them to offer the service to their clients.” Hickey also pointed to BNY’s use of smart routing to ensure that cross-border payments are processed through the most efficient corridors, depending on currency, counterparty and destination market. Carl Slabicki, executive platform owner for treasury services at BNY Junyi Kuah, head of international cash management solutions highlighted the introduction of virtual accounts for FI clients in 2024. “Our implementation supports both collections and payments.” He noted that BNY’s virtual accounts also allow FIs to open sub-ledger accounts under their clients’ names. “This is especially useful for our Asia-based clients that want to offer US-based collection services to their end customers but do not have domestic capabilities,” he said. Embedding data and AI to enhance delivery and client enablement Khoshbakht presented BNY’s progressive use of data and artificial intelligence (AI) as part of a broader effort to modernise service delivery, drive internal productivity and create better client outcomes. He explained that the goal is to transform the client experience by embedding data directly into the infrastructure and servicing model, moving beyond static reporting or post-event analysis. Khoshbakht said, “Data is part of how we deliver. It helps us pre-empt issues, support our clients more intelligently and run more resilient operations.” He illustrated the shift with specific internal initiatives. “We have reduced exceptions in our payments business by applying machine learning,” he noted. “We use predictive models to help identify when a payment might fail, and we can intervene before it breaks.” He said that the improvement in straight-through processing (STP) rate has been enabled increasingly by AI to reduce the remaining friction. Beyond automation, the focus is on visibility and enablement. “We are using data to surface insights that our frontline teams can act on,” he said. “That includes operational performance, risk triggers and relationship context. We want to give our people the tools to help our clients.” Khoshbakht stressed that AI deployment is measured and targeted. “We are focused on where it solves a problem—whether that is exception management, client escalation, or internal process improvement.” He noted that while data and AI are often marketed as futuristic or transformational, BNY’s application is grounded in operational discipline. “We are solving very real problems—manual workarounds, fragmented processes, inconsistent visibility—and we are doing it at scale,” he said. Khoshbakht acknowledged that expectations from clients are rising. “We are investing our technology to meet those expectations, and we do that with accountability.” Strengthening implementation and service delivery with an integrated client model Amy Tong, international head of client implementation and service for APAC as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), outlined how BNY has evolved its approach to client onboarding and servicing to support the growing client needs internationally. “The business is becoming more complex, and expectations are rising; hence the capability to enable our client experience seamlessly is key,” she said. “We are seeing clients launch products quickly and expect infrastructure and providers like us to move just as fast.” She noted that clients expect a trusted institution like BNY to provide real-time, on-demand access to onboarding progress and servicing updates, particularly when operating across markets and time zones. To meet this challenge, BNY has developed a more integrated client servicing framework that bridges the end-to-end client journey powered by data and proactive engagement with clients. “We’re building greater alignment across the entire value chain with a client-focused mindset.” Junyi Kuah, head of international cash management solutions at BNY Amy Tong, international head of client implementation and service for APAC at BNY Building scalable trade finance infrastructure through digital connectivity BNY’s approach to trade finance in APAC focuses on enabling scalable access to the global trade ecosystem without requiring clients to build out their own infrastructure. The bank acts as an intermediary and enabler, offering correspondent connectivity, message intermediation and compliance filtering through its Trade Network Access Service (TNAS). Angelia Toh, trade finance structurer for treasury services in Asia Pacific, introduced TNAS as a response to the challenges posed by the shrinking network of active relationship management application (RMA) in the documentary trade space. “There is a cost to maintaining the monitoring, the know-your-customer (KYC) and the documentation required,” said Toh. She explained that TNAS helps financial institutions bridge this gap by enabling them to route letters of credit (LCs) and trade messages through BNY’s active correspondent network. “We act as the first advising bank, stepping in to advise and forward the LC, while facilitating the compliance, workability and documentation checks,” Toh said. “This allows banks that may not have direct RMA (relationship management application) coverage to continue supporting their clients without operational disruption.” The service was formally launched in early 2024, following two years of piloting. “Mizuho in Japan and Golomt Bank in Mongolia were among the early adopters,” she said. “And since its launch, we have seen strong interest from banks across different parts of the region.” Toh stressed that TNAS is not just about message routing. “We are adding value by performing compliance checks before the message is sent,” she said. This pre-validation step, she noted, helps reduce disputes and rejections, especially when dealing with less familiar counterparties or complex LC structures. The platform is accessed through a secure, self-service portal that allows banks to view where BNY has active RMAs, submit requests for new coverage and track the status of transactions. “We have built it to be intuitive and flexible,” Toh said. “You can see in real time whether we can advise or confirm a transaction for a given counterparty.” One additional feature of TNAS is its support for LC confirmation and discounting, providing risk mitigation for banks that are unable or unwilling to take on exposure to certain issuers. Toh emphasised that “We are not competing with our FI clients. Our role is to make trade connectivity simpler, more reliable and more scalable.” The adoption of TNAS, particularly in APAC, reflects the broader trend of financial institutions seeking to preserve trade capabilities while reducing overhead and compliance complexity. “It is not always economical for FIs to maintain bilateral RMAs for every possible counterparty,” she said. “But through TNAS, we can extend that access on their behalf.” Extending infrastructure to underserved markets and FIs BNY’s treasury services strategy in APAC includes a deliberate focus on FIs and markets that have traditionally lacked access to reliable correspondent infrastructure. This includes new digital banks, niche regional players and institutions operating in emerging markets with limited USD clearing options or access to global networks. Yew Fei Yeow, head of treasury services for South and Southeast Asia, outlined BNY’s engagement with these underserved segments. “Many of these institutions are at an early stage of growth,” he said. “We see long-term value in supporting their growth and providing access to global clearing and payment infrastructure.” He highlighted how BNY has worked with newly licensed digital banks in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. “These banks have limited or no presence outside their home markets, and they look to us to provide capabilities that they don’t have,” Yeow said. “We can offer them access to USD clearing, liquidity and payment rails that they would otherwise need to build from scratch.” BNY’s ability to support these clients rests on its neutral position as a non-competing infrastructure provider. “That makes us a more acceptable provider for institutions that might otherwise be wary of working with providers that also have retail ambitions,” said Yeow. Angelia Toh, trade finance structurer for treasury services in Asia Pacific at BNY Yew Fei Yeow, head of treasury services for South and Southeast Asia at BNY In Cambodia, BNY is supporting local FIs by collaborating with them in their digital transformation journey. “The Cambodian banks show strong interest in familiarising with the evolving regulatory environment while improving their compliance standards,” he said. “We are a trusted advisor who regularly engages the local regulator and commercial banks, and can exchange viewpoints to help them, as they navigate their management of compliance and operational risk.” Yeow acknowledged that onboarding and compliance remain critical hurdles in some of these markets. “We believe in investing in long-term relationships. Once the infrastructure is in place, it opens up many more possibilities for the client.” Aligning global infrastructure with regional execution BNY’s execution in APAC demonstrates a methodical extension of its global platform strategy—bringing together infrastructure, technology and institutional servicing in a model that emphasises enablement. The region’s complexity, shaped by regulatory diversity and varying levels of digital maturity, has made it a proving ground for the bank’s unified operating approach. Across payments, trade finance and servicing, the bank remains focused on delivering infrastructure that supports FIs' ability to scale without having to replicate global capabilities internally. Whether through its role as a USD clearing service provider, an intermediary for documentary trade, or a provider of integrated onboarding and servicing, BNY consistently positions itself as a neutral and reliable counterparty. BNY’s investments in data and AI, while targeted, are enabling it to move toward more predictive and transparent operations—supporting both its internal teams and clients in managing complexity and exceptions. Meanwhile, its outreach to underserved segments, including digital banks and institutions in emerging markets, reflects a long-term strategy to embed itself into the foundational infrastructure of developing financial ecosystems. What remains is the challenge of continuing to meet rising expectations in transparency, configurability and time-to-value, particularly as fintechs and digital-native institutions reshape service benchmarks. BNY’s platform model provides a scalable foundation—but its regional success will ultimately depend on how well it continues to adapt that foundation to the specific demands of its APAC clients.",570,14756,2025-04-11

In the post-merger musical chairs at A&O Shearman, it seems quite a few partners couldn’t find a seat when the music stopped. Fifty nine partners have headed for the exit doors outside of Asia since the firm announced its plan to trim 10 percent of its global equity partnership last year.
According to Law.com’s recent tally, 25 of these departing partners hail from the US offices, with the remainder scattered across London, Europe, Africa, and Australia4. This exodus doesn’t even include the 15 partners who bid farewell from Asian offices, bringing the grand total to 74 partner departures worldwide.
A&O Shearman characterized these cuts as “a difficult but necessary step forward” following the May 2024 merger between Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling. About 45 of the departing partners have already found new homes at competing firms,
What’s particularly puzzling is that despite this mass exodus, A&O Shearman reports maintaining approximately 800 partners globally – roughly the same headcount they had when announcing the cuts. Perhaps the firm has mastered the art of the revolving door?
Or maybe the finessing comes down to some other factor we haven’t yet figured.
The explanation might lie in recent news that the firm is promoting 33 new lawyers to partnership effective May 1, 2025. While some partners pack up their offices, the firm appears to be simultaneously restocking its shelves with fresh talent.
This partner reshuffling comes amid A&O Shearman’s transition to an all-equity partnership model with a three-tier modified lockstep system, categorizing partners as ‘entry,’ ‘core,’ or ‘super’. The firm also closed its Johannesburg office and discontinued its consulting division as part of the post-merger restructuring.",298,1819,2025-04-29

By Puja Sharma
Sohar International has partnered with the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY) to strengthen its custody and asset servicing capabilities for clients in Oman. The move aims to support the growth of the country’s financial ecosystem and expand access to global markets.
As part of Oman’s broader vision to drive innovation and strengthen the country’s financial infrastructure, this relationship reinforces Sohar International’s role as a key enabler of capital market development and investment growth, aligning with the country’s Vision 2040 aspirations.
Sohar International, in its commitment to fostering a dynamic and robust financial ecosystem in Oman, has announced a strategic relationship with The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (“BNY”), a global financial services company, to enhance its custody offering for clients in Oman. As part of its broader vision to drive innovation and strengthen the country’s financial infrastructure, this relationship reinforces Sohar International’s role as a key enabler of capital market development and investment growth, aligning with Oman’s Vision 2040 aspirations.
Commenting on the relationship, Abdulwahid Al Murshidi, Chief Executive Officer of Sohar International, said, “At Sohar International, we are dedicated to advancing Oman’s financial sector by offering cutting-edge investment banking solutions tailored to our clients’ evolving needs.

eToro announced today (Thursday) the launch of a stock lending program that will allow its users in the UK and Europe to earn passive income by lending their stocks to borrowers. The Israeli fintech is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors in the online retail trading market, including Robinhood, which has been offering similar solutions for some time.
Passive Income with eToro
The initiative represents a significant expansion of eToro's existing relationship with BNY, which will act as the custodian for the new offering. Stock lending platform EquiLend will identify potential borrowers and facilitate the lending process.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it's been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way,” said Yossi Brandes, VP of Execution Services at eToro.
“Leveraging BNY's Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,” he added.
The program will initially be available to higher-tier eToro Club members—those with Platinum, Platinum+, and Diamond status—before being extended to other users at a later date.
eToro has been in the spotlight recently due to its planned IPO on Nasdaq under the ticker ETOR. The latest market disruption caused by Donald Trump's tariff announcements has led the company to pause its IPO roadshows as it “evaluates market conditions.”
How It Works
Users who choose to participate must opt in, after which their entire portfolio of eligible stock positions will be considered for lending. Only whole unit “real” stock positions qualify. CFDs and fractional shares are excluded.
Participating users will receive monthly statements tracking their income when their stocks are successfully loaned out. Securities with low market liquidity, high volatility, and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings.
While stocks are on loan, users temporarily transfer ownership to borrowers and forfeit voting rights. However, they continue to receive dividends and retain the ability to sell their stocks or opt out of the program at any time without incurring costs.
How Mach Can You Earn
While not explicitly detailed in the initial announcement, eToro has provided a formula in its help center for calculating potential earnings.
“Participants will receive monthly payments, equivalent to 50% of the net revenue eToro earns and receives from our partners for these lending transactions. The actual income from stock lending will likely vary from month to month depending on the market demand for the stock,” eToro explains in their FAQ.
The final values will depend on which assets are lent, the number of shares, and the variable lending fee, which fluctuates due to market supply and demand.
In eToro's example, they indicate that the lending fee rate is 1%, the facilitation and maintenance cost is 15%, and eToro's revenue share is 50% (remember those values are not fixed). The example referenced a relatively substantial investment of 2,000 Tesla shares at a price of $350 each, totaling $700,000. How much does eToro offer for a loan lasting 112 days (nearly 4 months) with this amount? Just over $925.
Is that a lot? Considering that the funds are already tied up in stocks, it's certainly a nice bonus and additional “dividend” from owning shares. However, for retail investors with typically much smaller portfolios, the profits will likely be rather symbolic.
For comparison, the stock lending program introduced by Swissquote, which has been functioning since 2024, offers an annual interest rate of over 5% for selected, most popular stocks. However, looking at Robinhood's offering, which implemented a similar solution in 2022, the terms are very comparable. The same applies to the Stock Yield Enhancement Program (SYEP) Derivatives introduced by Interactive Brokers in 2023.
Therefore, it can be concluded that eToro is not deviating from market averages in this regard.
Expanding Financial Access
Through BNY's Global Clearing platform, eToro's users can access over 19 exchanges globally, with integrated solutions for clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing.
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with eToro, supporting a holistic solution set across clearing, settlement, custody, foreign exchange, cash management,” Victor O'Laughlen, Head of Global Clearing at BNY, commented on the expansion. “This development represents the very best of eToro, Equilend and the heritage and innovation of BNY's world-class platform.”
eToro is providing educational resources on its platform to help users understand potential income opportunities and risks associated with stock lending.
Dan Dougherty, Managing Director, Global Head of Sales & Account Management at EquiLend, noted that the collaboration “marks a significant advancement in the securities lending market,” enabling eToro to enhance its services with a fully paid lending program.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued guidance noting that while securities lending may generate extra returns, it can also introduce additional risks, including counterparty and collateral shortfall risk. The authority unveiled some measures in 2023 to curb securities lending to retail investors.
As FinanceMagnates.com informed this week, Shir Shalom, who led various projects related to risk management at eToro, has announced her departure from the financial trading platform after serving nearly four years in various leadership roles. “Forever an eTorian,” she wrote on her socials.",400,5774,2025-04-10

The breach, detected in mid-February but impacting over 100 accounts for more than a year, is deemed a “major incident” by the OCC and the U.S. Treasury. The compromised emails may contain highly sensitive data provided by banks, including details on their financial health, cybersecurity protections, vulnerability assessments, and even the content of National Security Letters. These letters often involve confidential information related to terrorism and espionage investigations.
According to Bloomberg, the banks’ decision to limit information sharing stems from concerns about potential security risks to their own computer networks in the wake of the OCC breach. Representatives for JPMorgan and BNY declined to comment. A spokesperson for the OCC told the network that the agency is working with third-party cybersecurity experts to review the hack and its IT security policies and is keeping supervised institutions informed. The OCC also affirmed that onsite examiners retain necessary access to bank information.
Citigroup, operating under a tighter OCC consent order, has reportedly not limited its information sharing. It remains unclear if other major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have taken similar actions as JPMorgan and BNY.
Bloomberg’s sources indicate that some banks were unaware of the breach’s full extent until recent reporting, raising questions about the OCC’s initial response and security measures. The OCC is still working to determine the exact scope of the data compromised and whether affected banks need to be notified.
The incident has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which are seeking more information from the OCC. David P. Weber, a former OCC enforcement counsel, described the banks’ actions as a “historic” challenge to the regulator’s authority, signaling a “fundamental breakdown of the examination authority of the OCC.”

Experts quoted in the Bloomberg report warn that the compromised material could be used for targeted cyberattacks or extortion against banks. The breach highlights the cybersecurity risks within the financial sector and has eroded trust between banks and their regulator. The OCC has disclosed some affected staff accounts to the banks but has not yet detailed the types of data stolen, including cybersecurity-related information.",385,2513,2025-04-14

Key Notes
- The TRUMP development team transferred $19.6 million worth of tokens to major exchanges.
- Market maker Cumberland DRW made a transfer of 300,000 TRUMP tokens to the OKX exchange.
- The dumping closely precedes the high-profile dinner with top TRUMP holders to be held on May 22.
US President Donald Trump‘s Official Trump TRUMP $4.79 24h volatility: 1.2% Market cap: $958.52 M Vol. 24h: $157.46 M token, which had recently skyrocketed following the hype surrounding a private dinner invitation with the POTUS, has come under severe pressure after a massive token dump by insiders.
At press time, the TRUMP token trades at a 5% loss, driven by a confluence of bearish catalysts, including over $24 million in combined token offloading by the team and market makers.
TRUMP Team and Cumberland Flood the Market
According to on-chain analytics from Lookonchain, wallets linked to the TRUMP team deposited $19.6 million worth of tokens across major centralized exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit.
A wallet linked to the $TRUMP team deposited 1,346,000 $TRUMP($19.58M) into #Binance, #OKX, and #Bybit 9 hours ago.https://t.co/Mkk5VIjIFW pic.twitter.com/G4cuIBrQVq
— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 29, 2025
The breakdown:
- Binance: 700,000 TRUMP tokens, worth approximately $10.21 million
- OKX: 350,000 tokens, valued at $5.1 million
- Bybit: 296,000 tokens, totaling around $4.3 million
Adding to the sell pressure, prominent market maker Cumberland DRW transferred an additional 300,000 TRUMP tokens to OKX, amounting to $4.4 million.
Combined, this represents over $24 million in token deposits, a move that has triggered panic among retail holders. The timing, just weeks ahead of the high-profile May 22 dinner, has amplified concerns that insiders may be exiting.
Notably, Democratic US Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren have formally requested an ethics inquiry into the private dinner hosted by Trump for TRUMP token holders.
Their April 25 letter to Office of Government Ethics Director Jamieson Greer highlights that the dinner, which coincided with a sharp price rally, may have misled investors and influenced financial markets.
Technical Analysis: Signs of Exhaustion and Bearish Reversal
As of press time, TRUMP trades at $14.11, down from a recent high of $15.59. The token has breached key support at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level ($14.12) and is now flirting with the 0.786 level at $13.78.
If it fails to hold here, the next major downside target lies at the 1.618 Fib extension around $11.86, followed by deeper support at $9.56 and $7.26.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 62.59, cooling off from its recent overbought levels above 80. This RSI divergence suggests bullish momentum is fading. A drop below 50 could confirm a stronger bearish breakdown.
Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands (BB) are beginning to squeeze, signaling declining volatility and the potential for a decisive move. Price action breaking below the mid-band (20 SMA), currently at $14.02, hints at weakening support.
A bullish scenario would require TRUMP to reclaim the upper Fib levels, particularly the $15.00–$15.59 zone. A close above this resistance could open the door to new highs.

(NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC), and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) reported strong financial results that exceeded Wall Street expectations. JPMorgan led the group with an earnings per share (EPS) of $4.81, beating estimates by a wide margin. Wells Fargo delivered an EPS of $1.24, while BNY Mellon reported $1.55 per share, both topping analyst forecasts. These results reflect continued strength in core operations and cost discipline amid a mixed macroeconomic environment.
Beyond earnings, each institution highlighted transformative investments in technology as central to their long-term growth strategies.
From advanced AI capabilities at JPMorgan to Wells Fargo’s customer-centric digital upgrades and BNY Mellon’s platform modernization, technology emerged as a shared lever for efficiency, innovation, and enhanced customer service. These themes dominated the tech-focused portions of each earnings call.
Why It Matters: For CIOs, CTOs, and tech-focused business leaders, the Q1 commentary from three of the nation’s largest financial institutions underscores how integrated technology strategy is with broader business performance. Whether it’s deploying generative AI for operational streamlining or partnering with fintechs to scale innovation, these firms demonstrate what a mature digital agenda looks like at enterprise scale.
- JPMorgan Chase Scales AI Across Operations: JPMorgan Chase emphasized its enterprise-wide AI deployment, highlighting both generative and predictive AI use cases. CEO Jamie Dimon noted, “We now have over 1,000 AI use cases in production across risk, marketing, fraud, and customer service,” signaling a firm-wide commitment to embedding intelligence in core functions. Mary Erdoes added, “Our AI Center of Excellence is helping teams across the company deploy models faster and more safely.” These efforts not only improve efficiency but also give JPMorgan a scalable framework for innovation.
- Wells Fargo Upgrades Digital Interfaces for Better Customer Engagement: Wells Fargo reported progress on its modernization roadmap, particularly within consumer-facing digital experiences. CEO Charlie Scharf stated, “We’re seeing meaningful gains in mobile adoption, which is now above 85% for our digitally active customers.” He also pointed to technology investments enabling faster product rollouts, noting, “The changes we’ve made to our tech architecture let us develop and deploy much more quickly.” These enhancements are driving higher engagement while reducing friction across channels.
- BNY Mellon Modernizes Core Platforms to Improve Client Delivery: BNY Mellon is focused on re-platforming and automating key areas of its asset servicing business. CEO Robin Vince explained, “We’ve been investing heavily in platform modernization to bring real-time capabilities and a better client experience.” He also underscored the importance of automation: “We’re using machine learning to reduce manual processes, particularly in custody operations.” These upgrades support scalability and differentiate the firm’s client servicing model.
- Cybersecurity and Resilience Stay Front and Center: All three banks reiterated their focus on cybersecurity as digital complexity increases. JPMorgan’s Dimon emphasized, “We spend more than $15 billion a year on technology, and cybersecurity is a big part of that.” BNY Mellon’s Vince added, “Operational resilience remains a top priority, we’re investing to ensure our systems are both secure and scalable.” These remarks highlight how security is baked into digital transformation strategies, not bolted on after the fact.
- Fintech Collaborations Drive Innovation and Time-to-Market: Strategic partnerships emerged as a shared theme across the banks, with executives citing alliances that accelerate digital innovation. Wells Fargo’s Scharf noted, “We continue to leverage fintech partnerships to bring new solutions to market quickly, especially in payments and onboarding.” At JPMorgan, Erdoes said, “We’re blending our internal capabilities with those of external partners to push the boundaries of what’s possible in areas like blockchain and cloud.” Such collaborations are enabling faster iteration and adoption of cutting-edge solutions.

A range of experts name funds that investors can, in theory, own for decades, including when stock markets go through the occasional rough patch.
29th April 2025 11:27
by Cherry Reynard from interactive investor
Every seasoned investor will be grimly aware of the perils of market timing. It is a rare investor who doesn’t let FOMO get the better of them occasionally. Most will be familiar with the glee of rushing headlong into a popular investment, only to experience a Homer Simpson ‘Doh!’ moment after.
With this in mind, it’s important to think long term and remember that volatility, which markets have been experiencing over the past couple of months, is par for the course. While it’s hard to resist the urge to make changes when investments fall in value, adopting a buy and hold strategy helps manage the inevitable cycles of fear and greed that comes with volatile stock markets and herd behaviour.
- Invest with ii: Open an ISA | ISA Investment Ideas | Transfer a Stocks & Shares ISA
Evangelos Assimakos, investment director at Rathbones Investment Management, says: “Investors are always encouraged to take a long-term approach with their investments. That is prudent: markets swing around frequently, and can appear to be a ‘random walk’ over short periods of time. This approach, though, often goes against our human nature, which compels us to take action. A good way to help us keep a healthy, long-term approach is to identify fund managers that we can put our trust in to navigate markets for our benefit over different cycles.”
Buying and holding funds is not easy
But, as Assimakos admits, finding these fund managers is not easy. Something can be a great investment one minute, and a pretty awful one the next. The market environment may change, new technologies emerge, fund managers leave, and not all investment ideas work perfectly.
Daniel Lockyer, senior fund manager at Hawksmoor Fund Managers, outlines the difficulty: “The problem with choosing a single equity fund or a bond fund to own forever, is that market conditions and valuations change, meaning future returns can look more or less attractive at certain points in time. Even regular rebalancing of rigid asset allocations like the traditional 40/60 equity bond portfolios can become unstuck, as they did in 2022 when bond yields were close to 0% at the start of that year and equity valuations were high.”
Inbuilt adaptability
Nevertheless, with this caveat, there are certain qualities that make funds more appropriate as a buy and hold option. For example, funds that fulfil this brief are likely to need some kind of inbuilt adaptability – the ability to bend and sway with the market environment. Someone at the helm will be taking account of market pricing, and a changing market environment.
Lockyer believes it is only truly active multi-asset funds that can have this adaptability.
He says: “That is the very intention of that type of fund, given investors are ‘outsourcing’ asset allocation and fund selection to experts.”
Lockyer says of the Hawksmoor multi-asset funds, “today’s portfolio has a different set of assets and allocation compared to the one five years ago, which had a different portfolio to the one 10 years ago. Evolving the portfolio to current conditions within one fund structure means the fund acts like a swan, with lots happening beneath the surface that investors don’t see.”

- ISA ideas: short-term plays and long-term holds
John Monaghan, research director, Square Mile Investment Consulting and Research, suggests the BNY Mellon Multi-Asset Balanced fund. This is a multi-asset portfolio with a bias towards equities. He adds: “The simplicity of the fund's structure is attractive, along with its experienced manager and the large, dedicated global analyst team that supports him. The portfolio is invested in global equities which they believe will benefit from a range of structural themes and forces for change in the world.
“The investment process favours businesses that are well managed, have strong balance sheets, good cash flows and which are attractively valued. These businesses tend to have more defensive characteristics and should hold up better than the broader market when equity markets are falling.”
Assimakos’ choice is Troy Capital’s Trojan fund. This isn’t a conventional multi-asset fund, but it blends shares in high-quality businesses around the world while balancing out the stock market risks with the use of inflation-linked bonds and gold bullion. “A fund like this would naturally underperform stock markets when they are rallying but through its history, it has managed to deliver positive returns in most market environments, avoiding deep losses at any given time.”
Future proofing
A buy and hold fund is also likely to need some kind of future proofing. This is where passive strategies - index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - often fall down. They are good at running with yesterday's winners, but less good at pivoting to the next technology hotspot or adapting to changes in the market environment. A portfolio of AI-focused technology stocks has served investors extremely well over the past decade, but if a fund is really a buy and hold option, it needs the flexibility to find the next winners as well.
This means not being too dogmatic. Lockyer: “If choosing a single equity fund, it must be managed by a style-agnostic manager who will invest across all regions and market caps – and there are not many of those around.”

Nevertheless, Rob Burdett, head of multi-manager at Nedgroup Investments, believes there are some funds that stand the test of time. “Rathbone Global Opportunities Fund, run by James Thomson, can be volatile, but very worthwhile over the long term as it is focused, growthy and ideal for the long term.
“Another is Artemis Income fund run by Adrian Frost and team. I always admire the way Adrian focuses on the fact that he is looking after his investors’ life savings (which many managers forget!) and although a ‘veteran’ to some, he has instilled his beliefs in his team. An income fund can be a great ‘forever fund’ as you get comfort from a decent part of the return being delivered in regular income payments.”
Monaghan says that the Brown Advisory Global Leaders fund also fits the bill. “The investment process is incredibly well thought out and is separated into two distinct processes giving equal attention to both stock selection and capital allocation, which is a key contribution to the fund’s performance.”
High-growth options
High-volatility single strategy funds focused on areas with a strong pathway of growth might also qualify. Burdett gives the example of India funds. India has a huge long-term growth trajectory, with compelling demographics, and a strong reform agenda. He says: “Investing in one of the world’s fastest-growing countries with the world’s largest population, the long-term returns should overcome some current high valuations in the market.” On interactive investor’s Super 60 list of fund ideas is GS India Equity, while Asia-Pacific investment trust Pacific Assets Ord (LSE:PAC) has India as its biggest country weighting at 35%. Pacific Assets is on our ACE 40 list of sustainable fund ideas.
Assimakos likes the TM Natixis Loomis Sayles US Equity Leaders fund. “As the name suggests, it invests exclusively in US-listed stocks but seeks to identify companies with outsized growth potential that trade at a discount to their intrinsic valuation. Of course, its all-equity nature means that there have been periods of time when the fund’s valuation fell significantly, but it has recovered well in all past occasions.”
Certainly, buy and hold cannot mean set and forget, says Burdett. He believes investors should strive to know the funds they hold as well as they possibly can: “We encapsulate this thinking as ‘being the best-informed investor we can be’. The subsequent regular checking is because things change – fund managers move, teams alter, corporate mergers happen in asset management, and investment conditions and opportunities come and go.”

Equally, investors need to be sure that the fund manager is sticking to their knitting. Assimakos believes that the quickest path to ruin for a fund manager is to lose sight of their “true north” and start flip-flopping from one investment style to another in panic. He believes the best fund managers should be unwavering in their philosophy and style of investing and understand that there may be brief periods when their style is not the most popular, or even profitable.
“No fund manager makes great returns in all market environments, but the best ones do not suffer steep losses even during unfavourable times.”
True buy and hold options may be rare, but they do exist. Finding them is worthwhile, because it helps investors stay invested over time. They will also be a welcome option for those who would rather not have to micromanage their investments day to day, even if buy and hold cannot mean forgetting about them entirely.

Pune among fastest-growing job markets, sees 39% YoY increase
While Bengaluru and Hyderabad continue to dominate hiring, Pune has emerged as a fastest-growing job market, registering 7% month-on-month growth and 39% year-on-year growth, according to foundit Insights Tracker (previously known as Monster Employment Index) for February 2025.
Pune: A thriving tech ecosystem, rising presence of global capability centres (GCCs) and rich pool of students have made the city one of the fastest-growing job markets in the country.
While Bengaluru and Hyderabad continue to dominate hiring, Pune has emerged as a fastest-growing job market, registering 7% month-on-month growth and 39% year-on-year growth, according to foundit Insights Tracker (previously known as Monster Employment Index) for February 2025.
""With a 70% surge in GCCs - from 210+ in 2019 to 360+ in 2024 - the city has evolved into a strategic hub for global enterprises, driven by high-value, innovation-led work,"" said Karthik Padmanabhan, managing partner - GCC Business, Zinnov, a global management and strategy consultancy firm. The city continues to attract global players like Dassault Systemes, Tenerity, DataAxle even as BNY Mellon and American Express expand their footprints.
""Pune has emerged as one of the strongest hiring hubs, keeping pace with major metros like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. Its steady job market growth reflects sustained demand across industries, particularly in manufacturing, IT, healthcare, and BFSI. Pune's expansion has been more balanced, with both short-term and long-term hiring trends showing resilience,"" said V Suresh, CEO, foundit. Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital, said the hiring momentum remained high in the city, with companies actively recruiting software developers, AI specialists, and cyber security experts. ""Pune's tech job market is a key driver of growth in India, strengthening its position as a major hub for technology hiring. It ranks among our top four cities for business, and we expect around 10% year-on-year growth from this region,"" she said.
The reason why the city is emerging as a fastest-growing job market is because it offers a strong talent pool and lower cost compared to tier-1 cities. According to the latest LinkedIn Jobs on the Rise in Pune (2025), a data-backed ranking of the 10 fastest-growing jobs over the past three years - jobs like strategy manager, AI engineer, travel consultant, psychologist, and sales development representative were among the top fastest-growing jobs.
""With Pune emerging as a preferred destination for global innovation centres and deep-tech startups, demand for skills in AI, cloud computing, and automation is also surging,"" said Yeshab Giri, chief commercial officer, professional talent solutions, Randstad India, a talent company.

These shifts, along with recent market volatility are creating both challenges and opportunities for collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit fund managers. As a result, innovative operational enhancements and responsive risk management are more critical than ever for credit managers to adequately navigate this rapidly changing environment and support growth.
The merging of public and private markets is well-documented, with the private credit market experiencing extraordinary growth in recent years. According to a recent report by Percent, the private credit market is now worth about $2 trillion,1 nearly equaling the size of the broadly syndicated loan market. This evolution brings new opportunities for borrowers and investors alike.
Barring any impact by market volatility, growth of the private credit market is projected to hit $3.5 trillion globally by 2028,2 driving more managers to enter the private credit market to meet investor demand and capitalize on the opportunity. In doing so, they are offering loans in different fund wrappers, with the market now expanding beyond the traditional closed end draw down funds to include products such as exchanged traded funds (ETFs) and interval funds. Managers are also having to adapt to unfamiliar processes and integrate new order management capabilities into their systems as they seek to support shifting demands. For instance, private market managers are increasingly venturing into the broadly syndicated loans space, while many public managers traditionally focused on the syndicated space are developing private market capabilities. This involves building and maintaining lending networks to enable loan origination — a significant change from public managers' usual practices.
With private credit on the rise in the CLO and credit fund space — and with new CLO issuance reaching an all-time high of $191 billion as of November 20243 — to effectively compete, managers but equip themselves with tools to help clients capitalize on the transforming landscape, while also driving operational efficiency and remaining profitable.
The Challenges: unstructured data, operational inefficiencies
Unstructured data and how loan data is communicated are among the most pressing issues for the industry. Data ingestion — the intake, processing and normalization of the data for use — is critical to operational excellence in credit and loan administration. The bespoke nature of the traditional syndicated loans market, where credit agreement terms and conditions can be tailored to borrower and lender needs, offers flexibility but also presents challenges to standardizing how the data is ingested and ultimately consumed. While efforts are underway to achieve standardization of data for greater efficiency, the growing presence of private credit to the market, however, with its smaller lending groups and bespoke processes and communication methods, has added complexity. EY’s Global Alternatives Fund Survey indicates that data management and integration are significant concerns for alternative fund managers, with more than half of the those surveyed facing issues with real-time data or integration across functions4.
The lack of standardization in data messaging formats and fields across industry tools and platforms leads to inconsistent data being communicated between transactions, making it difficult for managers to make well-informed decisions about asset performance.
The way data is communicated is also not standard across the industry, with various channels and interaction models between borrowers and their treasury desks. This can result in a substantial amount of daily work for multiple parties to check each other's numbers, come to an agreement and produce reports upon which investment decisions can be made.
Another obstacle for managers is the heavy reliance on manual processes for reconciliation and settlement that are inherent in the over-the-counter loan market. Unlike other investment instruments, where settlement occurs electronically via exchanges, the loan market involves trading over-the-counter. End-to-end operations and reconciliation still rely heavily on manual, legacy processes, which can lead to operational inefficiencies, risks, input errors, data breaks and added costs. Loan settlement typically takes ten to 25 days, and manual processing can be particularly challenging during high-volume reporting periods. Coupled with the challenge of non-standardized data ingestion, the demand for private credit has increased the manual effort required by all parties.
Emerging trends for more effective data management
Given the importance of effective data ingestion as the foundation of any successful CLO or credit fund operational model, industry players are actively working to create more structured data and messaging. Automation, supported by advanced technology is already making a significant impact on performing more frequent data reconciliation, but more development is needed, in addition to standardization of data, for mainstream adoption.
Absent material standardization in the loan market to date, managers’ frequent and thorough reconciliation with loan and fund administration partners is crucial for operational efficiency. Regular reconciliation helps address issues and exceptions by maintaining consistent alignment and enabling discrepancies to be corrected immediately, rather than waiting until critical reporting dates. Early and frequent reconciliation can also lead to a smoother reporting process and potentially reduce pressure on managers and loan administration providers during report cycles.
Many firms are also looking to service providers for access to advanced technologies that can help streamline workflows, standardize operations and help enable managers to scale. In fact, 69% of respondents to the EY Alternative Fund Survey stated operational efficiency as the top driver of their technology investment.5
The industry is also adopting more structured consumption mechanisms within their facility set-up processes. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is being utilized to electronically “read” PDF documents — capturing, interpreting and processing relevant asset characteristics automatically. In addition, there is a growing movement around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models to enhance the flexibility of document consumption tools, enabling them to extract more critical information with less training over time.
AI and machine learning can also add considerable value by performing ongoing data quality checks, identifying and addressing common errors and enhancing straight-through processing. These technologies can help managers overcome challenges posed by the loan market's unstructured, memo-based nature and the use of legacy platforms.
Alongside AI, there is an opportunity for the industry to better leverage existing technologies, guided by human intelligence, to establish frameworks for exception-based tasks. This approach helps identify what can be consumed automatically and what requires manual processing. By focusing on these guardrails, attention can be directed specifically to where human intervention is needed, rather than on each transaction.
Transparency and confidence
To enhance transparency for clients across many aspects of the CLO lifecycle, leading service providers are investing in tools to increase managers’ visibility into the administration cycle and help ensure correct information is accessible on-demand as well as disseminated at scheduled reporting periods. This alone can be a game changer as managers deal with multiple structures and communicate with various third parties — ranging from clients to regulators and other industry participants.
To ensure smooth and efficient functioning, integration and interoperability of different data layers are essential. Technology solutions that can consume disparate data sources, standardize them and present them for consumption in a fit-for-purpose way across personas and use cases are vital for managers to navigate the evolving market. For instance, some data management platforms can ingest data from multiple
third parties — such as market data providers and servicing vendors — to offer complete oversight of transactional data, reference data and other types of data through a centralized repository. Acting as an outsourced data engine across a client’s entire book of business, reports can be built and ingested into the client’s own systems, ensuring seamless integration.
Managers need complete transparency into holdings, data breaks and documents to make informed investment decisions and meet regulatory requirements. But improved transparency goes beyond regulatory compliance; it can also enhance the reliability of data as a valuable asset for managers. With more trust in data quality, managers can make assessments with greater confidence, reducing the need for frequent double-checking and reevaluation. This improved data confidence is particularly important as the market appears poised for further growth.
Service providers can deliver significant value by supplying accurate, timley and integrated data, empowering managers to better meet their reporting obligations, reduce risks, improve overall perfomance and capitalize on growing market opportunities.
Beyond the back office: optimizing across the credit lifecycle
Moving beyond back-office operations, there are several other areas that present opportunities for managers to strengthen operating models, gain efficiencies and differentiate themselves in the market. Liquidity management and financing are two areas in which this can be applied. To effectively manage liquidity, managers should have access to a timely and comprehensive view of all investment operations data. The market demand for centralizing liquidity and financing activities within a single ecosystem creates efficiencies and scalability, allowing more flexibility to consider a broader pool of asset types to use as collateral. Integration with custody and payments offers a stable balance sheet for deposits and immediate proceeds upon redemption, while real-time trade confirmations and reports allow for instantaneous updates and views into position changes. In turn, this helps to maximize liquidity, manage risks and improve performance.
Additionally, middle office solutions such as performance, attribution, and risk services — especially when integrated with fund and loan administration offerings — can enable better decision-making and risk mitigation, along with fulfillment of investor and regulatory reporting requirements. Benefitting from a unified view of investment data, managers can more easily monitor fund activity, understand the impact of investment decisions and identify and execute on growth opportunities.
With the growing demand for credit products and fierce manager competition, distribution is a crucial area to focus on. By connecting with wealth advisors who are seeking credit products, managers can strengthen their distribution efforts and reach a broader audience of investors looking for new ways to diversify their portfolios and generate alpha. Service providers who offer comprehensive solutions can be valuable allies in this area, offering connections and introductions that can help drive distribution and growth.
Identifying the right service provider
The right service provider can be transformational for credit managers looking to achieve operational excellence and competitive differentiation. Domain expertise, scale, resiliency and flexible technology are all critical factors to consider when evaluating potential partners.
Specialized expertise in the credit space is an important factor for credit managers. A provider that genuinely grasps the nuances of the credit asset class can deliver valuable insights and consultation to help managers navigate the rapidly evolving market and evaluate opportunities to optimize operations through specialized services and technology. Providers should be set up to adapt to rapidly changing consumption models and be flexible enough to fit managers' evolving needs.
Achieving operating model scalability is identified as one of the industry’s top strategic priorities6. As the market grows, so will the volume and complexity of data that managers need to handle. This underscores the importance of choosing a provider that offers scalable, resilient technology, ensuring managers can effectively consume data and use it to seize opportunities as they emerge.
While leading-edge technology is important, it is essential to look for providers that have clearly articulated roadmaps for advancing their products — simplifying work and driving client success. A service provider that invests in the latest technology, coupled with a strong and agile product management discipline, can provide managers with fit-for-purpose tools to support their current and future needs. This includes tools for data ingestion, processing efficiency, accurate and timely data reporting and regulatory compliance. Some providers are already delivering increased automation, straight-through-processing, exception-based task and escalation workflows, systematic integration via APIs and cloud data-sharing, greater transparency via online dashboards and overall improved client experiences.
Ideally, the right service provider should act as an extension of their client's shop, providing seamless technology integration and well-honed operational workflows. This collaboration can lead to increased efficiency, cost savings and better decision-making across various stages of the credit lifecycle.
When evaluating a service provider, credit managers would be well served to ask the following essential questions:
1. How do you support the entire operational workflow, from data ingestion to processing and reporting?
2. What measures do you take to ensure data quality, accuracy and standardization to support decision-making and regulatory compliance?
3. How do you facilitate technology integration, streamline workflows and communications, and automate manual processes to enhance processing efficiency?
4. What are you doing to ensure transparency in reporting, including timely and accurate data reporting and complete transparency into holdings, breaks and documents?
5. Beyond operational support, what other products or services do you offer that could help enhance the management of our credit book?
By collaborating with a tenured service provider that offers specialized expertise, investments in technology and streamlined processes, credit managers can achieve operational excellence in credit management and enter a phase of growth where resources can be reallocated to focus on decision-making to stay ahead in an ever-evolving market. The right service provider can help managers turn data into an asset, increase efficiency, and improve the overall client experience.

EXHIBIT #1: RISING VOLATILITY ACROSS THE G10 AND EM COMPLEX
Source: Source: BNY Markets, Bloomberg
Our take
Tariff uncertainty and heightened volatility have led to a surge of risk aversion. The sharp asset repricing has triggered some capitulation and the liquidation of trading patterns, with significant intraday volatility across asset classes in foreign exchange, equities and fixed income. This market stress can be observed in a widening of the cross-currency basis, a widening of credit spreads, including on higher-rated investment-grade corporate bonds, and greater equity and currency volatility. The volatility this week has been indiscriminate, with no currency or region spared. As shown in Exhibit #1, both emerging market and G7 currency volatilities have been moving in tandem compared with the more common differentiation of market volatility in a particular region. For example, emerging market FX was more volatile in Q4 2024, before being overtaken by the G7 region in the first quarter of this year. This situation was exacerbated by the response of the U.S. bond market. In contrast to the flight to quality bid on bonds, the U.S. Treasury curve bear steepened significantly, with 2-10y curve at 70bp, nearly 30bp steeper on the month, and 30y U.S. Treasurys hitting a high of 5% before settling around 40bp higher on the month.
This led to a surge in bond volatility, with the MOVE index, which measures U.S. bond market volatility, soaring past its November 2024 highs. Indeed, the MOVE index is at its highest level since September 2023, when the U.S. Federal Reserve telegraphed that it might keep rates higher for longer.
Forward look
At the time of writing, there is no sign of global trade tensions easing, with the U.S. imposing a record 125% import tariff on China, and China retaliating with tariffs as high as 84% on U.S. products. In response to U.S. tariffs, the European Union has approved retaliatory tariffs on around €21bn of U.S. goods, and Canada is reported to be imposing a 25% tariff on certain vehicle imports from the U.S. In other words, tariff uncertainty is here to stay, not to mention the risks of a further tightening of trade restriction in critical sectors.
EXHIBIT #2: EURO SCORED HOLDINGS
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Our take
The ECB policy meeting next week will be crucial for determining the direction of travel for the euro in the near term. ECB members seem to be shifting toward further rate cuts despite the less dovish tone at the March meeting, saying the trade war will have a “non-negligible” direct impact on the economy and warning about the disinflation threat from the euro’s strength. Euro appreciation this year has been spectacular, from testing 1.01 in early February to moving above 1.10 in April, a gain of nearly 6% year to date. Looking at the pricing dynamic of the euro in recent days, we have noticed an unusual dislocation, with EUR/USD going higher and a narrowing of the bond spread. The 2-year Eurozone and U.S. Treasury yield spread narrowed this week, driven by a lower Eurozone yield and a higher U.S. Treasury yield. This dislocation might continue for technical reasons but is typically not sustainable.
Forward look
Looking at iFlow, aggregate euro flows have been strong. iFlow data, especially from cross-border transactions, showed persistent short covering in Q1 2025, at almost as fast a pace as the liquidation that occurred in Q4 2024. As shown in Exhibit #2, euro scored holdings from cross-border investors, at around -1, are narrower than at the beginning of 2024. Looking at the euro as a whole, the currency’s high valuation might have resulted in some selling pressure. Indeed, iFlow showed weekly euro outflows for the first time this week after 11 straight weeks of inflows since mid-January 2025. Trading will continue to be volatile up ahead given the downside growth risk in the Eurozone, the direction of monetary policy and continued cross-border investor demand for the euro as a diversification play.
EXHIBIT #3: APAC WEEKLY AVERAGE SCORED FLOW
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Our take
The reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S. hit Asia hard, especially China, which was slapped with a minimum tariff of 125%. Most APAC countries face high reciprocal tariffs, with the exception of Singapore, which is subject to the minimum tariff of 10%. Other APAC countries saw high tariff rates, too, including Vietnam at 46%, followed by Thailand (36%), Taiwan and Indonesia (32%), India (26%), South Korea (25%), Malaysia (24%) and the Philippines (17%). Though there might be some consolation in the 90-day period for lower 10% reciprocal tariffs on non-retaliating countries, tariffs will likely pose significant downside growth risks to the region. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has said that the tariffs imposed by the U.S. and any retaliatory levies by other nations will adversely impact domestic economic activity.
APAC equities have experienced severe market volatility in recent days, including a 13% selloff on the Hang Seng Index, the bourse’s largest one-day selloff since October 1997. And Taiwan equities recorded a decline of 10% on Monday, the biggest one-day drop on record. Foreign investor sentiment about equities has been bearish and shows no signs of improving. This was especially true in South Korea, where foreign investors have sold over $6bn in equities so far in April, more than the previous high of $5.7bn net sold in September 2024. Similar selling pressure can be seen across the APAC region, including in India and Taiwan.
APAC foreign exchange price action has been volatile as markets must navigate between risk-off and a capital outflow-triggered selloff against the softer U.S. dollar-induced rallies in foreign exchange. Capital outflows and uncertainty have won the argument. This and the loosening of the PBoC’s grip on the Chinese yuan have exacerbated the downside risk for Asian currencies. China’s official daily CNY fixings breached 7.20 this week, the first time since September 2023 and USDCNH reached historic highs this week, with an intraday high of 7.4290.
Forward look
In the context of the acute market uncertainty, capital outflows and negative market technical features, the selloff in APAC currencies over the past week has been relatively contained. Indeed, looking at iFlow, the weekly average scored flows for APAC currencies has been broadly positive, led by CNY, HKD, KRW and SGD, with outflows in MYR and IDR (see Exhibit #3). The observed inflows cannot be entirely explained by the unwinding of hedges, as overall investor flows in the government bond complex have been positive. One primary stabilizing force in the region, in our view, is the stepped-up smoothing activities by regional central banks, notably Bank Indonesia, which intervened in onshore IDR and offshore NDF. A similarly firm intervention stance can be seen in Taiwan, where USDTWD is kept firmly at a critical level of 33.0. While the pressure continues for APAC currencies, we do not expect depreciation momentum to be unhinged. We will continue to monitor asset flows as a swing factor for Asian currencies.",400,7423,2025-04-10

EXHIBIT #1: CROSS-BORDER SELLING OF USTS SINCE APRIL 2
Source:BNY Markets, iFlow
Our iFlow data confirms that cross-border investors are exiting U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets. Last week, our U.S. Treasury flow registered its third largest outflow by foreign-based investors since the early days of the pandemic. As Exhibit #1 shows, cross-border outflows from USTs have been almost entirely across the yield curve, with only the very long (10y and higher) segment seeing inflows from abroad.
The sharp sell-off in bond yields, with the 10y note pushing up to 5.7% intraday at the end of last week, has keyed speculation in the markets of foreign shedding of USD-based assets and musings about “de-dollarization”, or the beginning of the end of the USD as a global reserve currency. Even with the DXY U.S. dollar index moving below 100, we think that discussion is premature from a long-term structural economic perspective. There is no doubt that U.S. assets, including Treasuries, are seeing increased selling pressure.
Exhibit #1 shows average daily flows (on a scored basis) for different yield buckets on the curve and cash and short-term instruments (“CAST”) since April 3, the first day after the administration announced sweep universal and retaliatory tariffs. While the selling – save for the very long end – has been unequivocal, it is hardly a recent development.
EXHIBIT #2: FLOWS WEAKER SINCE BEGINNING OF YEAR
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Exhibit #2 shows cumulative cross-border flows into (or out of) USTs over the past twelve months, starting on April 12, 2024. We accumulate overseas flows every day, allowing us to see the ebbs and flows of foreign demand. In mid-2024, after the resolution of the debt ceiling crisis, we see a large jump in foreign inflows into USTs, primarily due to a slew of T-bill issuance that occurred upon the debt ceiling’s resolution. From that point on, save for a few brief and discernable episodes – like October 2024 and late December last year- foreign demand has been tepid at best. By the end of 2024 and early 2025, we have observed persistent and sustained selling by foreign domiciled real money investors, reaccelerating after early April 2025.
EXHIBIT #3: EXITING US FIXED INCOME
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
We have seen evidence of foreign selling across other USD assets as well. In U.S. equities, selling by cross-border investors has been persistent since late 2024. Across non-UST fixed income assets, we see selling in MBS securities, munis, and corporate bonds over the past 5 days. This shedding of USD-denominated assets is broad based, as seen in Exhibit #3.
Forward look
Foreign investors exiting USD denominated assets, especially in fixed income, has been a feature of post-election U.S. markets. However, since April 2, it has accelerated and become broad-based, which we don’t think is a short-lived phenomenon. While U.S. economic policy uncertainty remains at historically high levels and U.S. asset volatility is similarly elevated, investors remain skittish. Additionally, the Federal Reserve argues that rates are on hold until clear signs of weakness in U.S. growth data emerge.",418,3409,2025-04-15

A Texas appeals court has reaffirmed a lower court’s finding that The Bank of New York Mellon breached a foreclosure settlement agreement with homeowners David and Teresa Hall - but slashed their $1.36 million jury award by more than half, citing insufficient evidence for most of the emotional distress and credit damage claims.
The dispute stems from a 2017 Rule 11 Agreement - a judicially recognized settlement - that was intended to resolve earlier foreclosure litigation involving the Halls' home equity loan. Under the agreement, the loan was to be modified to a principal of $57,207.95 at 4% interest over 18 years. The agreement also required the Halls to make three specific trial payments and provided for $1,250 in additional compensation to them, while BNYM would handle escrow for taxes and insurance and adjust credit reporting according to standard procedures.
Although the Halls made all required payments and signed the documents, BNYM - through its servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing - never countersigned the modification. The Halls testified that their payments were inconsistently applied or returned, and that no formal modification was ever finalized. Their efforts to clarify the situation, they claimed, were met with delay and vague assurances.
In 2019, the Halls sued again, alleging that the bank had failed to honor the agreement, misrepresented the status of the modification, and harmed their credit through faulty reporting.
The Jefferson County jury found in favor of the Halls on multiple claims, including breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and deceptive conduct. It awarded more than $1.2 million in compensatory damages, including $90,000 for past credit harm, $250,000 for expected future credit injury, $700,000 for mental anguish, and over $135,000 in attorney’s fees. Prejudgment interest pushed the total to $1,359,071.20.
BNYM appealed, arguing that the Rule 11 Agreement was unenforceable and that there was no valid basis for tort-based damages. The Texas Court of Appeals disagreed on enforceability, finding that the agreement was valid and that BNYM had breached it. Testimony and correspondence presented at trial supported the conclusion that both parties intended to be bound by the settlement and understood that the trial payments would reduce the loan balance.
However, the appellate court reversed the verdict on multiple damages claims. It ruled that the $250,000 award for future credit damage, $90,000 for past credit harm, and $200,000 for future mental anguish were not supported by sufficient evidence. The court also suggested a remittitur - a voluntary reduction - of $450,000 in past mental anguish damages, leaving only $50,000 if the plaintiffs accept the adjustment. If not, a new trial on damages will be required.
Additionally, the court reversed the trial court’s award of $265,146.15 in attorney’s fees and remanded the fee issue for further proceedings.
The decision is a cautionary tale for mortgage servicers and investors in asset-backed certificates. It underscores the binding nature of Rule 11 Agreements in Texas and the risks of failing to follow through with modification terms—even when final documentation is incomplete.
Critically, the court held that oral assurances and partial compliance with settlement terms, combined with evidence of intent, were sufficient to create enforceable obligations. The servicer’s inconsistent treatment of borrower payments and failure to finalize terms led directly to the breach.
While emotional distress and reputational harm are more difficult to prove, the breach of contract finding stands as a stark reminder that borrowers are entitled to rely on settlements—especially after they've performed their part.",511,3926,2025-04-17

A Peek Into the Tempting Menu
The images showcased an array of colorful and appetizing dishes. One photo featured a traditional North Indian lunch of plain rice, chole (chickpeas), and dry aloo sabzi (spiced potatoes). Another meal included jeera rice, creamy paneer curry, chapatis, mixed dry vegetables, and a serving of halwa for dessert. Yet another plate displayed a tasty mix of pulao and paneer, while other snapshots revealed salads and gourmet-style offerings like chocolate mousse sandwiches, veg chowmein, chilli paneer, roasted soya chunks, and paneer kababs paired with parathas.DJay noted in the comments that what he shared was merely “10% of the menu.” According to him, the full spread regularly includes a rotating variety of treats such as brownies, muffins, and other desserts that could rival those of a five-star buffet.
Curious minds soon uncovered the identity behind DJay. He is reportedly Dhananjay Dhawale, a tech professional employed at BNY Mellon (BNY India), a prominent financial services firm. His LinkedIn profile confirmed his role in the tech sector, making it all the more impressive that such culinary delights are a routine part of his office environment.
The viral post reignited conversations around employee satisfaction and creative workplace perks. While flexible hours and remote work options are popular, DJay’s post proves that sometimes, the way to a loyal employee's heart truly is through the stomach.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) has successfully piloted the first intraday repo trade settled through its triparty infrastructure.
The USD-denominated pilot transaction, which took place in February, saw UBS borrowing cash from Swiss Re while delivering collateral via BNY’s global collateral platform.
The success of this pilot demonstrates the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo with a specified start and end time through BNY’s triparty infrastructure, whereby the allocation and return of eligible collateral is settled and matured intraday against payment. Additionally, market participants can access intraday repo through their existing triparty legal documentation on the BNY platform.
“We are continuously evolving BNY’s platform infrastructure to unlock new trading patterns for the market,” said Gesa Johannsen, Executive Platform Owner – Global Collateral, BNY. “Complementing our new early morning maturity option for triparty transactions in the U.S., our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
Leveraging its existing collateral platform infrastructure, BNY’s intraday triparty repo solution enables market participants, like UBS, to source liquidity for specified periods of time without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period. For lenders such as Swiss Re, the solution provides an opportunity to generate additional income on excess, idle cash.
“The use of intraday funding in our industry is evolving,” said Jason Crosskey, Head of EMEA Funding and Optimization Solutions, UBS. “This facility enhances intraday capabilities by allowing institutions to provide or access cash at specific times to better manage liquidity.”
“This is a great way to deploy any otherwise dormant intraday cash and to contribute to market liquidity,” added Richard Hochreutiner, Head of Global Collateral, Swiss Re. “Using BNY’s platform seamlessly builds on existing infrastructure and documentation.”
In April, Banco Santander and Rabobank also successfully completed an intraday triparty repo transaction, executing trades in both directions — borrowing and lending – through BNY’s collateral platform. Settling both legs of the repo trade intraday provided the parties with enhanced flexibility, streamlined collateral management, and improved short-term funding efficiency. As triparty agent, BNY provided the infrastructure, collateral servicing, and settlement support required to enable this trade.
“We are pleased to have collaborated on one of the first intraday triparty repo trades in both directions,” said Enrique Verdu, Managing Director – Securities Finance, Banco Santander. “This represents meaningful progress in how we can manage and optimize intraday liquidity.”
“There is clear appetite from market participants like Rabobank for more dynamic and efficient short-term funding solutions,” added Allan Bolk, European Head – Securities Finance and Repo, Rabobank. “Executing both sides of the transaction intraday through a triparty setup delivers valuable optionality and operational ease.”",542,3304,2025-04-09

This speaks to the software company’s continued ability to innovate and adapt from a leader in software to being at the forefront of AI, having first invested in OpenAI in 2019. More recently, it has incorporated Copilot, an AI-powered digital assistant, into Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and Excel. Looking to 2030 and beyond, we believe Microsoft will continue to rank highly.
Another is Alphabet, a business which has built up a dominant position in online advertising and search, through Google. Like Microsoft, it has also been in the AI game for years, having bought the UK-based AI research laboratory DeepMind back in 2014. Alphabet has a strong competitive position over the long term, thanks to its ownership of multiple platforms with billion-plus users, strong data-gathering capabilities, proprietary hardware and mobile operating systems (Android).
BEYOND SENTIMENT
It is still very early days for AI and progress is rarely linear. While, Walter Scott believes many of today’s market leaders will continue to play a critical role in the AI ecosystem for decades to come, history at least suggests that recent concentration levels are unlikely to persist.",464,2007,2025-04-09

Later, BNY’s Ben Slavin provides an update on the ETF share class structure and product innovation.
ETF Launches Poised for Record Year
Product innovation and launches have been at an all-time high, with around 50 ETF launches just in the past three weeks.
“Even with all the market turbulence, the tariff uncertainty, and the headlines changing on a dime, there’s just no stopping each engine of ETF creation,” Chang said. “There have been about 288 new ETFs this year. That compares to roughly 120 by the same time last year.”
Right now, the industry is averaging more than 75 new ETFs coming to market a month in 2025. This means the industry could be headed for 1,000 new launches this year, which would handily break last year’s record of about 750.
Of the new ETFs, equities have dominated the scene, making up around 70% of all launches, Chang said.
Notably, about 200 of those new equity ETFs have been actively managed. “They’ve also been about 30% of all the volume. We just recently hit that $1 trillion mark on active ETF assets. That’s now 10% of the total ETF pie,” she highlighted.
Chang also noted the proliferation of derivatives-based and leveraged products. Sixty-three leveraged ETFs have launched this year already compared to 71 launched in 2024. Furthermore, single-stock ETFs in particular have really blown up. Direxion alone applied for 71 leveraged ETFs, she said.
Notable ETF Launches to Highlight
Unlimited HFGM Global Macro ETF (HFGM)
HFGM fund offers an actively managed, global macro hedge fund approach to investing across a range of asset classes.
“Bob Elliott … is bringing top-tier market expertise to the table and offering an array of hedge fund strategies in an ETF wrapper at a disruptively lower price,” Chang said. “This one uses a proprietary algorithm to invest in a number of ETF and futures contracts widely held by global macro hedge funds, and it really just changes based on the market.”
Unlimited is trying to replicate this hedge fund strategy with a slightly amplified risk/return profile since it operates with roughly twice the volatility of a given sector, according to Chang.
“This is actually the first of many ETFs Unlimited is planning to roll out in an ETF wrapper,” Chang added.

Cambria Endowment Style ETF (ENDW)
The Cambria Endowment Style ETF offers a diversified, global investment strategy that seeks income and capital appreciation. This ETF provides exposure to major global asset classes and seeks to use an endowment style investment approach. The fund is designed to pursue returns across various market conditions while maintaining an aggressive risk profile.
The fund launched with $98 million, funded by individual advisors and investors who swapped to the ETF format from a separately managed account through a 351 Exchange, according to Chang.
“It’s an active global asset allocation strategy inspired by endowment-style investing, which was obviously done very well,” she added.
iShares S&P 500 3% Capped ETF (TOPC)
TOPC offers distinct capped exposure to the equities within the S&P 500. Following a fee waiver, the fund has a net expense ratio of just 9 basis points.
“It caps holdings so that no company has a weight of over 3%,” Chang noted. “It rebalances quarterly, and then, as I understand it, any excess weights are redistributed to the remaining holdings based on their market caps.”
Invesco’s RSP will be the fund’s chief competitor, according to Chang. RSP provides greater exposure down the cap spectrum; however, TOPC is more competitively priced.
“[TOPC is] almost reminiscent of a mutual fund strategy in that you have a cap on individual stock weightings,” she said. “To some, equal weight might just be too extreme a dilution.”
“I think [TOPC] gives you a good balance between the two. It’s kind of an in-between product for extreme dilution and the typical large-cap, heavy-weight, top-weighted, S&P 500,” Chang added.

Brookmont Catastrophic Bond ETF (ILS)
ILS is the first U.S.-listed ETF dedicated exclusively to catastrophic bonds.
“It has zero correlation with the market. It’s tied purely to unexpected natural disasters,” Chang explained. “Even if the U.S. goes into a recession or geopolitics kind of rears up again, it’s insulated from that.”
She thinks the fund is difficult to pull off because there are questions of how to price it correctly and whether holdings offer enough diversification.
“I think it’ll start off with a sophisticated investor looking for a major diversifier,” Chang said.

Teucrium 2x Long Daily XRP ETF (XXRP)
Teucrium launched the first U.S.-based XRP ETF earlier this month.
Notably, the ETF itself saw over $5 million in trading volume on its debut, according to Chang.
“Obviously, there is strong institutional interest there,” she said. “This launch coincided with a nearly 40% increase in XRP overall trading volume itself, reaching approximately $9 billion.”
While many investors have questions as to why a leveraged futures-based product was approved before a spot ETF, Chang said it comes down to regulation.
“It’s a derivatives-based futures market. It’s tightly regulated; it’s tightly monitored. Regulators feel they have a better grasp,” she explained. “Cash can obviously be manipulated, whereas futures are much tougher to manipulate. So that’s why we saw sort of clearance of futures with bitcoin before the spot product itself.”

ETF Share Class: Updates on the Regulatory Front
The rise in adoption of active ETFs is fueling the interest around the share class structure. There have been over 50 applicants who have filed, with many more asset managers on the sidelines looking to jump in, Slavin said.
“Certainly, what we are hearing is almost universal interest across our asset manager client base,” he added.
“We think the time frame does seem to be accelerating,” Slavin noted. “But, I think there’s a difference between the ability to actually do it and then the readiness for the managers and the platforms to be able to support all this.”

Building upon the success of the first Public Sector Awards introduced at Trace DC in July of last year, this new program recognizes achievements among Chainalysis customers that are leveraging blockchain analytics in extraordinary ways across industries worldwide.
Nominations came from across Chainalysis and were thoughtfully evaluated by an internal judging panel. Ultimately, three exceptional organizations were honored, recognized for innovation, measurable impact, and successful public-private collaboration.
Chief Revenue Officer Bas Lemmens shared, “It was incredibly difficult to choose winners — these organizations represent the best of what this ecosystem has to offer.”
Innovation Award: BNY
The Innovation Award honors organizations that have demonstrated outstanding creativity and forward-thinking use of Chainalysis solutions to drive innovation within their organizations. Whether through the adoption of cutting-edge technologies, the implementation of novel strategies, or the development of groundbreaking initiatives, the Innovation Award celebrates those who are pushing the boundaries and reshaping the landscape of compliance and investigations.
BNY took home this honor. A pioneer and valued Chainalysis customer for several years, they were one of the first large financial institutions to publicly enter into digital asset custody for crypto. BNY developed an integrated framework using the full suite of Chainalysis solutions — including our software, training, and data.
Amy Slivka, member of the Digital Assets business, accepted this award on behalf of BNY.
“We are proud to play a role in supporting market developments on behalf of our clients, including offering digital asset custody for select crypto assets for U.S. based institutional clients, and are committed to building on our 240-year legacy of trust and innovation as we bridge the blockchain and traditional finance ecosystems.” —Marissa MacDonald, Head of Digital Assets Risk, Resiliency & Controls at BNY
Beyond their internal innovation, BNY has played a key role in shaping how Chainalysis supports the broader banking sector. Their leadership has not only influenced the direction of our solutions, but has also paved the way for other institutions to confidently navigate the world of digital assets. We’re proud to recognize BNY as a trailblazer and we’re excited to see what they’ll do next.
Impact Award: Coinbase Global Intelligence Team
The Impact Award honors customers who have achieved measurable, transformative outcomes through their use of Chainalysis data and expertise. These organizations not only elevate their own operations but also contribute to broader industry and public safety goals.
This year’s winner, the Coinbase Global Intelligence Team, was recognized for its efforts to combat the misuse of crypto in fentanyl-related activity. By partnering with Chainalysis and leveraging Signals data, Coinbase was able to validate crucial leads, identify high-risk entities, and share actionable intelligence with law enforcement. The intelligence shared between both teams has expanded understanding of this growing threat, resulting in targeted disruption of criminal actors.
Lauren O’Brien Kelly and Jacob Baker accepted this award on behalf of the Coinbase Global Intelligence Team.
“Fentanyl continues to plague our country and the world, so we were happy to do our part in expanding awareness and disrupting these networks. Special thanks to Joe, Sarah, Caleb, and Collin on the Chainalysis team for enriching our data and making this initiative a great success.” —Lauren O’Brien Kelly, Senior Investigator, Global Intelligence at Coinbase
Coinbase’s continued dedication to building a safer cryptocurrency ecosystem sets a strong example for the industry. Their preventative, data-driven approach reflects the power of combining technology with mission-driven partnerships for the greater good of all.
Public-Private Partnership Award: NPCC National Cybercrime Team
Collaboration between the public and private sectors is essential to addressing today’s most complex challenges — the Public-Private Partnership Award celebrates exactly that. This award recognizes outstanding cross-sector efforts that drive innovation, enhance enforcement capabilities, and deliver meaningful outcomes for broader communities.
This year’s recipient, the UK’s NPCC National Cybercrime Team, has been a valued Chainalysis partner for many years. By leveraging Reactor, training programs, and investigative support, NPCC National Cybercrime Team has played a key role in combating illicit cryptocurrency activity across the UK. Recently, this relationship has evolved into a formal joint intelligence partnership, with Chainalysis investigators and data scientists working hand-in-hand with the NPCC National Cybercrime Team to proactively develop intelligence targeting asset seizure opportunities.
Andrew Gould accepted the award on behalf of the NPCC National Cybercrime Team.
“When we made our first crypto-related seizure over 10 years ago, we manually investigated the blockchain and wondered: ‘Where on earth are we going to store this?’ Now, Chainalysis tools are in the hands of officers across every cybercrime unit in the UK. The future for us is stepping deeper into operational partnerships, using blockchain not just to track, but alongside police tools to proactively locate and disrupt criminals globally. We’re incredibly excited and grateful for this recognition.” —Andrew Gould, Programme Lead, NPCC National Cybercrime Team.
A cornerstone of this collaboration is two-way data sharing — expanding enforcement capabilities and enabling faster, more effective disruption of criminal activity. The NPCC National Cybercrime Team has fully embraced the value of blockchain data as a core intelligence asset, and the results have been immediate and impactful.
Powering a future of collaboration
Congratulations to all of the winners. Chainalysis is proud to support your efforts, and we look forward to celebrating even more progress and success at next year’s awards.

House Republicans Draft Cuts to Federal Employee Pensions
The changes would cause many government workers to contribute more, while receiving reduced benefits.
Federal employees’ pensions could undergo several changes that would gradually reduce their benefits, as part of a Republican federal budget resolution working its way through Congress.
Representative James Comer, R-Kentucky, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has offered proposals that would change how federal civilian employees’ benefits are calculated, which would make them pay more into the system while receiving reduced benefits, according to an April 25 release.
“The House Oversight Committee is taking a critical step to advance President [Donald] Trump’s America First agenda and ensure taxpayer dollars are used effectively, efficiently, and responsibly,” Comer said in a statement. “The Committee will consider legislation that delivers a substantial win for fiscal responsibility, achieving a reduction in the federal deficit of over $50 billion dollars.”
The committee is set to consider the legislation on Wednesday, April 30.
The proposal would raise federal and postal employees’ contribution rates to 4.4%, which the release estimated would raise $30.7 billion for the deficit reduction. The current contribution rates are based on each employee’s date of hire, as follows: 0.8% if hired in or before 2012; 3.1% if hired in 2013; and 4.4% if hired in or since 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The Federal Employees Retirement System is the retirement system for federal civilian employees. It provides benefits from three different sources: a Basic Benefit Plan, Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan. In fiscal 2022, more than 2.7 million people received federal civil service annuity payments; 56% received annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (which covers federal employees hired before 1984), and 44% received annuities under FERS, according to information from FERS and the Congressional Research Service.
For new federal retirees, the proposal would eliminate the extra retirement annuity payment currently provided to those who retire before age 62, lasting until they reach their Social Security retirement age and saving $10.1 billion, according to the release.
Federal pension benefits would also be reduced by basing retirees’ benefits on the highest average five years of salary, compared with the current standard of the highest average three years of salary, which would save $4.75 billion, according to the release.
Other changes include offering federal employees the option to “serve at will” to receive higher take-home pay, which would save $4.54 billion.
The proposals come as Republicans develop their larger federal budget resolution, which House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, has previously said he would like to finalize as early as May.
The House GOP has a goal of finding at least $2 trillion in savings to partially offset the cost of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, as well as adding new cuts to taxes on overtime and tips. The Senate, in its version of the budget plan, has given itself leeway to make as little as $4 billion in cuts.",425,3338,2025-04-28

Major lenders and mortgage servicers are facing class-action lawsuits in New York over allegations that they inflated foreclosure-related charges on home equity loans, improperly costing homeowners thousands of dollars.
The lawsuits, filed Thursday in US federal court in Brooklyn, claim that lenders and their servicing partners wrongly applied compound interest instead of simple interest during a critical stage of the foreclosure process. Specifically, the alleged miscalculations occurred between the time lenders sought court authorization to sell a property and when that motion was officially granted.
According to the filings, the practice systematically increased the payoff amount owed by borrowers, diverting surplus funds that should have gone back to homeowners following foreclosure sales.
“Countless mortgage holders were deprived of surplus funds as a result of the collective failures by foreclosing banks, loan servicing agents and their attorneys,” said Mark Anderson, a partner at Anderson, Bowman, Wallshein, the firm leading the litigation.
The list of defendants includes major financial institutions and mortgage service providers, among them Fannie Mae, Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Mr. Cooper Group Inc., and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency, known for providing low-interest loans to first-time buyers, was also named in the lawsuits, as were several law firms and MTGLQ Investors LP, an entity owned by Goldman Sachs that specializes in distressed loan acquisitions.
The lawsuits draw comparisons to misconduct exposed during the 2008 financial crisis, when lenders and servicers paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle claims related to improper foreclosure handling.
In one case detailed in the filings, Sheila Bidar, the legal guardian of her 89-year-old mother Ruth Athill, is serving as a class representative. Bidar alleges that the loan servicer, Select Portfolio Servicing Inc., and other parties involved charged an extra $13,300 in interest due to improper calculations.
The case also claims that Athill’s home, foreclosed and auctioned in May 2023, was initially bid on for $785,000, but the bid was ultimately reassigned to Deutsche Bank, her lender. The property later sold for just $207,071, according to court documents. With an outstanding mortgage balance of $167,773, the drop in the sale price combined with the inflated interest amounted to a $591,000 shortfall, according to the complaint.
“She’s lost out on so much. It’s really heartbreaking,” Bidar told reporters.

Defendants responded with mixed comments. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said the bank acted solely as a trustee on the residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) and was not involved in day-to-day servicing.
“Loan-level matters, including foreclosure actions and subsequent purchases or sales of properties, are handled exclusively by mortgage loan servicers,” the Deutsche spokesperson said.
A representative for Bank of New York Mellon made a similar statement, claiming it held no responsibility for the foreclosure process. Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, Goldman Sachs, and the law firm Eckert Seamans declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. Several other defendants have yet to issue statements.

The new feature will enable eToro users based in the UK and Europe to earn passive income by lending out their stocks.
While BNY will act as the custodian, the companies will work with stock lending platform EquiLend to identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
Eligible eToro users will be given the option to opt into the programme, with their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending.
Once opted in, eToro said users will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earn in the specified period.
Only whole unit stock positions are eligible for lending and eToro said that fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.
The company added that stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
Users who lend their stock temporarily give ownership of the stocks to the borrower and lose voting rights while the stock is on loan. However, eToro said they can still receive dividends, sell the stocks or opt out of the programme at any time at no cost.
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+ and Diamond Club members, with this followed at a later date by lower-tier Club members.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way, yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets,” said Yossi Brandes, VP execution services at eToro. “Leveraging BNY’s Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,”

BlackRock Advances Toward Blockchain for Money Market Fund Shares
BlackRock has filed to issue digital shares for one of its well-known money market funds. These shares are anticipated to reflect the performance of the BlackRock Liquidity Funds Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX). They will employ blockchain to provide an additional level of transparency regarding the ownership of the shares.
The news, in an SEC filing published today, could signal a significant shift from traditional asset management models regarding the use of blockchain in financial services. The shares themselves won’t be tokenized, but blockchain will be employed to mirror ownership records in the interest of verification, giving investors a transparent way to verify ownership.
How BlackRock Works to Use Blockchain in Its Digital Shares
The digital shares will be backed by BlackRock’s Treasury Fund, primarily investing in U.S. Treasury bills and cash, worth over $150 million. The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) will use blockchain technology to maintain a “mirror record” of share ownership. The blockchain will maintain an updated ledger of share ownership for verification purposes, but it won’t function as the primary, legally binding ownership record.
Institutional Investment Requirements for BlackRock’s DLT Shares
The barrier to entry for institutional investors seeking to purchase these digital shares is enormous. The DLT shares can only be acquired with a minimum of $3m and the trades will only be done on transactions that pass through BNY Mellon. The exclusivity underscores the product’s strategic, large-scale focus, targeting institutional investors rather than retail ones.
Although the filing doesn’t peg details on a ticker or management fee for the digital shares, the filing foregrounds the potential for blockchain to further leak into mainstream aspects of finance. The filing is aligned with similar moves by other large finance industry players, like Fidelity, which recently filed for an Ethereum-based share class that could represent their own U.S. Treasury fund.
BlackRock and the Growing Market for Treasury Tokenization
Filing as a longer-term trend in finance: experimentation with blockchain to allow tokenized versions of things like treasury bills and other traditional financial instruments. Already, the treasury tokenization market is more than $6 billion in value, with BlackRock’s BUIDL boasting more than $2.55 billion in assets.
The Regulatory Setting and Its Potential Impact on BlackRock and the Industry
The BlackRock filing comes on the heels of a similar effort by Fidelity, which recently filed for an Ethereum-based OnChain share class. Though Fidelity’s filing remains subject to a regulator’s blessing, the interest in blockchain and financial service is clear. If these filings are granted, it could be an indication that blockchain is being increasingly embraced at traditional financial markets.
The BlackRock’s shift is also a product of the company’s strategic place in a shifting market. BlackRock, with more than $8 trillion in assets under management, has the clout and capacity to push for a shift in how financial products are designed and sold. If this works, these digital shares could replace much of the opacity and overhead in the asset management world.

Providing Asiaâs EAMs With Heavy-Hitting Support â BNY Pershing
In this continuing series, we talk to BNY Pershing about the work it does with EAMs in Singapore and other financial centres in the region.Â
This news service is continuing to track how banks and other financial services firms serve Asiaâs external asset managers, with a particular focus on Singapore, but also other centres such as Hong Kong. (See previous articles here, here, here and here.)
These articles come ahead of our scheduled WealthBriefingAsia EAM Awards 2025, taking place on 16 October, in Singapore. Nominations for entries are open.
In this article, we talked to the
firm about what it does and its views about the
sector.
Please explain your EAM offering
BNY Pershing
offers a wealth services platform to external asset managers and
advisory firms across the region. This platform provides a range
of services including execution and custody, which allows them to
provide access to their clients to a number of financial assets
and markets, helping them help more people.
BNY Pershing has a number of longstanding client relationships across the region, doing business for more than 20 years. We also support a number of innovative firms globally. (BNY Pershing gave the case of its support for US-headquartered Arta Wealth Managementâs public launch in Singapore, in October 2024. Arta uses Pershing to support its clients across both its US and international client base.)
How important is the EAM business line to the firm in
general, for example, for revenue growth, etc?
BNY Pershing is seeing significant growth both internationally
and within Asia Pacific and we expect this to continue to benefit
the industry and our business.
When dealing with EAMs, what are the main tasks and forms
of support they ask for the most and why, in your
experience?
Most queries are product-based in nature, inquiring about
different assets and markets available via the platform
(structured, alternatives, funds, fixed income or traditional
equities) or different reporting and analytical capabilities. BNY
Pershing has a professional and an investor portal, the latter
which can be white labelled and offered directly to the advisorsâ
UHNW clients.
How important has the rise of Singapore-based Variable
Capital Companies (VCCs) been in driving what EAMs
do?
Weâve certainly seen the rise of VCCs in driving what EAMs do,
attracting Southeast Asian investorsâ capital â particularly
the HNW/UHNW segment. For BNY, VCCs focused on alternative
investments have been an important area within BNYâs Asset
Servicing Business, where we can provide a full suite of fund
administration and custody solutions today.
Interestingly over the last nine to 12 months weâve also seen a shift in VCC interest from regional EAMs to global EAMs targeting Southeast Asian-based investor capital, using VCCs for access funds. More broadly we see the rise of VCCs as a driver of change and innovation in the funds industry across the region, from the launch of the Hong Kong LP structure to some of the recent announcements from the [Hong Kong] Securities and Futures Commission relating to alternative Hong Kong OFCs [open-ended fund companies], amongst others.
Regulatory issues remain important, and Singapore is of
course no exception, along with Southeast Asia more generally.
Are there topics that are particularly front of mind at the
moment?
Weâve certainly seen an increased focus on resiliency, client
asset safety, and transparency over the years. Resiliency is core
to our commercial business model, and our EAM clients benefit
from the same resiliency being used to service most of the
largest institutions in the world.
We have heavily invested in our core technology stack, modernising our infrastructure, and deploying active data centres. We are also market leading in leveraging AI/ML tools with one practical example being anomaly detection in our transaction and messaging flows. At times, this has allowed us to identify and escalate infrastructure issues or cybersecurity threats originating from outside of our organisation directly to our clients allowing them to mitigate the impact.
We also see that several markets are actively encouraging diversification and globalising their investments to increase retirement income and returns, in part to combat ageing populations. This includes a move to self-directed portfolios with a greater penetration and reliance on financial advice.
How is digital technology shaping the sort of custody
services you provide, for example affecting its cost, range of
service, etc?
Depth, quality, and sophistication of product capabilities is
increasingly important, and a unique competitive advantage across
the BNY group which includes the largest global custodian, the
largest agent lender, the largest US clearing broker dealer, and
access to a wide range of assets.
We provide our clients with unique access to this ability to scale, innovate, and deliver to their client base. One example specific to EAMs and wealth management is the additional portfolio yield that can be generated by participating in a fully-paid securities lending programme. We provide EAMs with direct visibility on the potential revenue that a clientâs asset portfolio could yield if they participated in securities lending so that they can drive meaningful client conversations.
Another example might be our algorithm [algo]-based fixed income portfolio construction, optimisation, and trading solution â BondWise. It helps advisors construct and optimise client portfolios while aggregating liquidity.
Finally, a last example might be our âMoney in Motionâ analytics screen which allows advisors to monitor and identify client asset flows quickly across their client base. Not all products and services are offered in all countries.",384,5843,2025-04-14

In terms of profits, revenue and earnings per share, the first three months of the year marked BNY's best first quarter on record. Net income was $1.15 billion, up 21% from the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.58, beating analysts' estimates of $1.51, according to S&P. And revenue was $4.79 billion, surpassing expectations and marking a 6% increase from the year-ago period.
Even so, CEO Robin Vince struck a cautious tone in a call with journalists on Friday.
""There's clearly been some signs of optimism at the beginning of the year, but we've now seen a reversal of sentiment, which has been driven by uncertainty,"" Vince said. ""So we now have quite a few things on the minds of market participants.""
The CEO said a number of factors contributed to this uncertainty, first and foremost the seesawing tariff policies of the Trump administration. Vince said he sees the flux as part of a long-term negotiation strategy, which means businesses will have to wait a while for the ""final picture"" to come into focus.
""Last week's tariff announcements were clearly part of a broader strategy to try to reset relations between the U.S. and the rest of the world,"" he said. ""It's our expectation that these negotiations are going to take some time, and this uncertainty will likely have some length to it.""
Like other banks, BNY saw its stock take a hit after Trump imposed tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners. In the two days after the announcement, BNY's stock dropped by
The combination of uncertainty and stock volatility has created challenges for BNY — but also opportunities, Vince said. ""At times of uncertainty in markets, we're kind of viewed as a port in a storm,"" he said. ""And so the uncertainty actually attracts people to our platform, because they see us as this sort of rock of stability.""
In the first quarter, fee revenue reached $3.4 billion, a 3% increase from last year. Net interest income jumped 11% year over year to $1.16 billion.
BNY's sale of a Toronto-based trust company also boosted first-quarter revenue. BNY sold the business to the Australian stock transfer company Computershare in March. In the first quarter, BNY said it gained $40 million from the sale.
Overall, analysts at Truist called it a ""good but not outstanding"" quarter for BNY.
""We still like BK stock here for its status as one of the most defensive banks combined with the growth and offense made possible by recent investments,"" David Smith, vice president for banks equity research at Truist, wrote in a research note.
With roots dating back to 1784, BNY is one of the oldest banks in the world. But in recent years, it's been betting big on some of the newest financial technologies. In 2022, BNY
That product ran into a regulatory roadblock from the Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission, which required custodians to
The reversal, which came less than a week after Trump's inauguration, was so sudden that it caused some whiplash during a recent interview with one of BNY's executives. At a conference hosted by UBS in February, Emily Portney, BNY's head of asset servicing, said the bank was proud to be ""one of the very few institutions"" that can have custody of digital assets.
That prompted a puzzled reaction from the moderator, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. ""I thought that was against the rules,"" Hawken said.
In the call with reporters on Friday, Vince said crypto regulations are needed to set the ""rules of the game,"" but the particular rule BNY ran up against, SAB 121, ""didn't make any sense."" The fact that it's now been rescinded, he said, is helpful to BNY as it continues to provide platforms for digital assets.
""There have been some impediments to full participation from a regulatory point of view,"" Vince said. ""We haven't let that stop us.""",393,3953,2025-04-11

Cullen had just helped close the market, marking the firm’s milestone of surpassing C$3 trillion in assets under administration (AUA). For the CEO who took the helm barely two years ago, the moment was more than ceremonial. “I’m incredibly proud,” said Cullen, noting that reaching the C$3 trillion mark reflects “the trust our clients place in us and the hard work of our talented team”.
Cullen’s praise for the work of the nearly 2,000-strong team stretched to every employee who had contributed to the success over nearly three decades whether through solidifying, onboarding, or supporting the business during its history.
“This achievement isn’t just about the number,” he continued. “It’s about delivering meaningful progress… and continuing to innovate for our clients.” In other words, crossing the $3 trillion threshold is not a finish line, but a springboard for CIBC Mellon’s next evolution.
Spurring further innovation
Hitting C$3 trillion in AUA places CIBC Mellon in rarefied air. It ranks the Toronto-based custodian among a select group of global asset servicing firms that have ever reached such scale, reinforcing the firm’s role as a trusted provider in the industry.
The joint venture – co-owned by two powerhouses – administers assets on behalf of Canada’s largest banks, insurance companies, pension plans, investment funds, corporations and other institutional investors.
The growth has been striking. As at 31 December 2024, CIBC Mellon’s administered assets were roughly double the level from just a few years prior.

Hitting C$3 trillion in AUA places CIBC Mellon in rarefied air. It ranks the Toronto-based custodian among a select group of global asset servicing firms that have ever reached such scale, reinforcing the firm’s role as a trusted provider in the industry.
The joint venture – co-owned by two powerhouses – administers assets on behalf of Canada’s largest banks, insurance companies, pension plans, investment funds, corporations and other institutional investors.
The growth has been striking. As at 31 December 2024, CIBC Mellon’s administered assets were roughly double the level from just a few years prior.
Cullen attributes this climb to strong client relationships and operational resilience. “It’s a significant milestone that reflects our clients’ confidence in us,” he explains to Global Custodian. “We have a relentless focus on making sure that the clients know that we are looking out for Canadian requirements. We’re advocating for regulatory changes and we’re supporting what is somewhat unique in the Canadian market.”
Beyond the sheer number, Cullen sees symbolic weight in the milestone. It coincides with a period of stability and expansion for the firm. CIBC Mellon was founded in 1996 as a 50-50 joint venture between Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and The Bank of New York Mellon – now known more succinctly as BNY. The unique parentage has always been a key to CIBC Mellon’s success – and never more so than now, as global investors increasingly seek both local insight and international reach.
With the support of BNY, CIBC Mellon has steadily broadened its service offerings. The firm has long provided custody, fund administration, pension benefit services and unitholder recordkeeping, as well as enabling access to parent company services such as foreign exchange and securities lending.
In more recent years, the CIBC Mellon has launched and grown capabilities in emerging areas like digital and data services, helped launch the world’s first bitcoin and ether ETFs in Canada, advanced into the insurance business and inked alliances with a growing array of fintechs to improve its efficiency and offerings.
The milestone places CIBC Mellon ahead as the largest Canadian custodian and also validates the company’s strategy of running the business better and innovating for clients. For CIBC Mellon, scale has come hand-in-hand with trust – and with pressure to keep raising the bar.
Global scale, local expertise
Global scale, local expertise
Cullen is the first to highlight the advantage of CIBC Mellon’s parentage. “Our unique position as a Canadian leader backed by the global strength of BNY allows us to offer our clients a combination of local expertise and global capabilities,” he explains.
In practice, this means clients benefit from a massive global network – BNY’s custody platform spans over $52 trillion in assets worldwide – while dealing with a team on the ground in Canada that understands the local market and regulatory landscape.
It’s a balance of big and small, global and local. Cullen often describes CIBC Mellon as the Canadian arm of BNY’s global asset servicing network, with deep roots and client relationships in Canada thanks to CIBC.
This dual identity enables the firm to tap into cutting-edge technologies, risk management practices and product capabilities from its multinational parents, then tailor them to Canadian client needs.
He points to the firm’s culture of focus on client service, innovative technology and operational excellence – a culture reinforced by both parent organisations.
Innovation in operations
Innovation in operations
Perhaps the most dramatic change Cullen has witnessed in asset servicing is the rise of automation and data analytics in what was once a manual, paper-driven business.
“Innovation in the custody space is largely driven by rapid advancements in technology and the growing power of data analytics,” he says. “At CIBC Mellon, teams are witnessing transformative progress in areas such as automation and artificial intelligence, which are revolutionising how transactions are managed and processed allowing for greater efficiency, accuracy and speed in daily operations.”
Subsequently, mundane back-office tasks that might have taken hours of human effort can now be completed in seconds with the right algorithms. Cullen notes that the firm is actively investing in cutting-edge technologies to streamline processes and deliver real-time insights to clients. The goal is to shift staff away from repetitive workload and toward higher-value analysis and client service.
One recent example is CIBC Mellon and BNY’s launch of the first integrated investment operations solution for a Canadian insurance company. “This solution represents a comprehensive service model, including the first outsourced general insurance fund accounting solution in Canada,” says Cullen.
He stresses that innovation isn’t pursued for its own sake, but to add tangible value: “Our commitment to continuous improvement, agility and staying ahead of industry trends enables us to provide exceptional value and maintain our competitive edge,” he says.
The future of asset servicing
The future of asset servicing
Looking ahead, Cullen expects the asset servicing landscape to continue shifting – and perhaps at an even faster pace. “The industry is poised for significant transformation in the coming years,” he predicts.
On the horizon are new technologies like digital assets and blockchain, which “will revolutionise the way securities are issued, traded and settled,” according to Cullen.
Today’s custodians may soon find themselves safekeeping tokenised stocks or bonds, not just paper certificates or electronic records. At the same time, clients and regulators are demanding greater transparency, security and real-time processing in every transaction. This is pushing firms to upgrade systems and rethink old processes.
Regulation, too, remains a wild card. From evolving accounting rules to heightened cybersecurity requirements, asset servicers will need robust, flexible infrastructures to keep up.
“At CIBC Mellon, we are committed to staying at the forefront of these changes,” he says, ensuring the firm continues to provide clients with cutting-edge solutions and services whatever the future may hold.
Part of that readiness comes from drawing on its shareholders’ strengths – whether it’s CIBC’s deep knowledge of Canadian banking or BNY’s investments in global fintech and risk management.
If the past few years have proven anything, it’s that adaptation is essential. Cullen admits that one of his constant concerns is cybersecurity, given the rising sophistication of cyber threats. But here again, he draws confidence from preparation: “Our cybersecurity strategy benefits from the considerable focus, investment and resources of CIBC in Canada and BNY globally, ensuring we are well positioned to protect our clients,” he notes.
From his vantage point, the future of asset servicing will be defined by those who can blend scale with agility. As Mal Cullen guides CIBC Mellon beyond the $3 trillion milestone, he is effectively balancing two imperatives: safeguarding the trust it took decades to earn, and reinventing the business to meet the demands of the next decade. It’s a juggling act he embraces.
After all, as Cullen puts it, relentless adaptation is part of the job description when you’re a “leader in asset servicing.” And if CIBC Mellon’s trajectory is any indication, the company is well on its way to defining what asset servicing will look like in the years ahead – global yet local, efficient yet innovative, and always prepared for what’s next.",365,9403,2025-04-24

Over 100 compromised email accounts, accessed for more than a year without detection, exposed privileged supervisory data about the financial health of major U.S. banks. In the aftermath, institutions like JPMorgan Chase and BNY Mellon scaled back electronic engagement with the OCC. Prioritizing internal risk posture over procedural convenience.
Now, the OCC is reshuffling its own architecture. Effective June 2, the regulator will consolidate its supervision units, merge policy and risk divisions, and elevate its Information Technology and Security (ITS) function to the agency’s executive committee. That last move is telling. After years of treating IT as a backend utility, the OCC appears to recognize that digital security is no longer operational support. It is a condition for legitimacy.
Why It Matters: When a regulatory body fails to detect a breach for more than a year, while it collects cybersecurity assessments from the very institutions it oversees, there is a more fundamental failure at play. It is about culture, architecture, and the trust contracts that define modern financial infrastructure.
Security has to be embedded in organizational design, not bolted on. The OCC’s restructure acknowledges this, albeit after the fact. Elevating IT and Security to the executive table sends the right signal. But it also underscores how far regulators have to go to meet the resilience standards they themselves enforce.
- Information Sharing Downgraded to Manual Workflows: JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, facing potential downstream exposure, scaled back electronic file transfers with the OCC. This shift reflects a breakdown in digital trust and highlights the operational impact of upstream security failures. When regulatory systems become liabilities, institutions are forced to default to slower, risk-contained alternatives.
- Supervision Functions Consolidated for Strategic Agility: The OCC is merging its Large Bank, Midsize and Community Bank Supervision units into a single Bank Supervision and Examination structure. The consolidation suggests an effort to reduce functional silos, improve cross-tier coordination, and create faster response capabilities. A move that mirrors how technology leaders are rethinking internal org design to support real-time adaptability.
- Risk and Policy Operations Brought Under Unified Leadership: By consolidating its Bank Supervision Policy and Supervision Risk and Analysis units under a reinstated Chief National Bank Examiner, the OCC is moving toward a more integrated risk-intelligence model. For CIOs, this underscores the value of aligning policy governance and threat detection under a unified operational lens.
- ITS Function Gets a Seat at the Strategy Table: Perhaps the most meaningful change is the creation of a new Senior Deputy Comptroller for Information Technology and Security. This role, reporting directly to the executive committee, reflects a governance model where cybersecurity is no longer peripheral. It reinforces the mandate for technology leaders to ensure security leadership is structurally embedded in strategic planning.
- Cultural Shift May Be the Hardest Lift: Reorganizations and title changes only go so far. The deeper challenge lies in embedding a risk-aware culture across regulatory and supervisory functions. Technology executives will recognize this as a familiar reality — that security maturity depends as much on behavior and accountability as it does on tools and frameworks.

Firms such as PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard could have direct benefits, while Charles Schwab and BlackRock could gain indirectly.
The passage of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act would substantially benefit major regulated players in the US financial and crypto sectors, according to a Nansen report.
The firm highlighted that the STABLE Act’s licensing and reserve requirements create a regulatory moat favoring established institutions already aligned with US compliance standards.
Additionally, the report predicted that Coinbase could be among the biggest winners in crypto. As a major distributor of USDC and a partner of Circle, the exchange's model already fits the regulatory vision for fiat-backed stablecoins.
Coinbase’s custody and exchange operations may also see expanded demand for compliant storage solutions and increased liquidity consolidation.
The STABLE Act proposes establishing a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins, restricting issuance to licensed entities, and requiring full backing with cash or short-term Treasury securities.
Advantages for TradFi and crypto firms
Payment companies such as PayPal, which issued PYUSD in collaboration with Paxos, are positioned to leverage new regulatory clarity to expand stablecoin-enabled payment services across peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and cross-border transactions.
Visa and Mastercard, which previously piloted stablecoin settlement projects, could further integrate regulated stablecoins into B2B payments, treasury management, and real-time settlement layers.
Traditional custodians, including BNY Mellon and State Street, as well as infrastructure providers like Nasdaq, are poised to benefit from the demand for custody and compliance services. BNY Mellon’s relationship with Circle, managing USDC reserves, is a model for this emerging service line.
Meanwhile, asset managers, like BlackRock and Charles Schwab, are also expected to benefit indirectly. As regulated stablecoin issuers park reserves in government money market funds, these firms may see increased inflows. BlackRock, which already manages USDC reserves, could expand its role in this area.
Global and DeFi implications
The report notes that international firms such as Payoneer, MUFG, and Nomura may also benefit from using compliant stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border US dollar-denominated transfers.
In contrast, decentralized stablecoins such as DAI, crvUSD, and GHO, which do not meet the Act’s definition of payment stablecoins, face a diminished role within US markets. These tokens will likely shift activity offshore, explore legal workarounds, or operate in a regulatory gray zone.
The report expects lending protocols like Aave and Compound to adapt by prioritizing compliant stablecoins in their US offerings. At the same time, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve will need to geofence or de-emphasize pools tied to non-compliant assets.
The STABLE Act also bans direct interest payments to stablecoin holders, restricting yield-bearing stablecoins like the Origin Dollar (OUSD) unless they register as securities with the SEC.
As a result, the future stablecoin market may favor tokenized money market funds and compliant DeFi lending products.",403,3370,2025-04-18

- The news comes as banks across Wall Street pull bankers back to the office full time.
- Business Insider obtained the memo, which said the bank has no plans for fully in-office work.
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., known for helping financial clients clear and custody securities, is the latest bank to rein in remote work. In a memo to staff, the firm's executive committee announced that it was asking employees to return to the office four days a week.
The memo, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said the new requirement would take place starting September 2, 2025, the day after Labor Day. The firm, commonly known as BNY, has required its workers to be in the office three days a week since 2023. Managers were called back to the office four days a week earlier this year.
The switch comes as companies from Amazon to AT&T start asking workers to return to pre-pandemic norms. Similar efforts are unfolding across Wall Street: JPMorgan Chase called its workers back to the office five days a week earlier this year, prompting some workers to explore unionization efforts or look for new jobs.
The memo from BNY's executive committee focuses on the importance of community and culture, which requires that employees spend more time together in the office.
It also emphasized the importance of ""personal flexibility.""
Indeed, BNY told its 51,000-plus employees it has ""no plans"" to require five days a week. It said employees will also continue to have the flexibility to work two weeks a year from anywhere, a perk the bank has dubbed ""work from anywhere.""
The bank, which also offers wealth management and investment advice, had previously instituted a 2-week ""recharge period"" around the end of each year, which allows employees to work remotely and skip non-essential activities, like internal meetings.
See the memo below:
As we continue to place even more emphasis on our community and culture, we believe that it is important that all of us spend more time together working, leading and learning from each other. As a result, we have decided that it is appropriate to ask all employees* to return to the office 4 days a week by September 2, 2025.
As a leadership team, we're committed to maintaining personal flexibility, and will continue to support remote work one day a week. We have no plans to return to 5 days in office unless circumstances were to demand otherwise.
We also want to remind everyone that we provide a ""work from anywhere"" benefit and a range of other benefits to help colleagues care for their mental and physical health and wellbeing.
This step is also facilitated by the continued investments our firm is making in our offices and workspaces to deliver a modern, world-class in-office experience to our employees.
Being in the office together helps us collaborate and move work forward more efficiently. Occasional remote work can be effective, but in person we can respond more quickly to dynamic, fast-paced financial markets and better serve our clients. Most managers are already in the office 4 days a week, and we have seen the positive momentum this creates.
While we expect all employees to return to the office 4 days a week by September 2 at the latest, our offices are already open to you to come in as frequently as you'd like.
One BNY is more than an idea or a concept — it's a culture, and culture is made up of people. Which means all of us. Thank you for your commitment to our clients, our company and our community, and to this next step on our journey to Thrive Together.

In early 2023, Celent estimated that banks had already poured more than US$100 billion into preparations for the new messaging standard. Once corporate spend was factored in, the number ballooned to a staggering US$2 trillion. And that was just the beginning. With the November deadline looming, institutions continue to invest in ensuring requirements are fully met.
Euromoney examines the state of ISO 20022 readiness among major global banks: how far they’ve come; the decisions they’ve made; and what’s left to do as the industry closes in on full adoption.
JP Morgan Payments went live with the first phase of ISO 20022 in March 2023 to support clients during their own migrations, explains Colin Williams, head of clearing transformation, who says the bank currently accounts for about 30% of ISO 20022 cross-border payment message traffic sent over Swift. “Our systems were all enabled to natively process the new format messages, whilst also being able to handle any legacy MT messages that were still being sent across the network,” he says. “We also successfully migrated in support of each market infrastructure (central bank high-value clearing system) that has adopted ISO 20022 messages.”
As the industry approaches the end of the coexistence period for legacy systems, it is crucial for banks and corporates to collaborate closely
Matthew Parker-Jones, Scotiabank
Citi has implemented a bridging solution with an ISO transformation layer on the existing payment product processors, which coordinates the migration across platforms, including Swift and payment market infrastructures. In parallel, the bank is transforming payment processing by adopting ISO native solutions with a calibrated approach to existing legacy payment product processors.
BNY created a dedicated ISO 20022 migration team to address issues around technology, operations readiness, testing, compliance, client communication and support. The bank took this opportunity to transform its core payment applications to support native ISO, reducing the risk of data truncation that would have resulted from translation. The transformation extended to other elements of the business including cash investigation systems, client databases and screening tools. Previously, the limited number of dedicated message types for certain transactions, lack of structure, absence of key payment actors, limited field space and lack of identification fields led to regular misuse of messages by the Swift community, resulting in rejects, repairs, longer processing times and complex sanction screening processes.
“With ISO 20022 and the introduction of Swift’s transaction manager and case manager platforms, the community can expect easier resolution of investigations and compliance with local regulations,” says Isabelle Bouille, director and principal product manager at BNY. “They will benefit from more structured and richer data, although these benefits will not be measurable for a few more years.” Current traffic analysis shows that ISO 20022 messages are used similarly to FIN MT messages, commonly referred to as the ‘like-for-like’ approach.
We have developed a new ISO 20022-native payments platform which will play a definitive role in how we support the new standard
Rogier van Lammeren, Lloyds
Scotiabank has implemented significant changes to its infrastructure with ISO 20022 embedded, enabling global channels to integrate with its payments infrastructure using common services. The bank continues to work with Payments Canada and Swift for testing and readiness activities. “As the industry approaches the end of the coexistence period for legacy systems, it is crucial for banks and corporates to collaborate closely,” says Matthew Parker-Jones, senior vice-president and global head of product management, global transaction banking at Scotiabank. “We have partnered with other financial institutions on testing activities to ensure that the additional structured data we send with payments is not only accurate but also consumable by our partner financial institutions.”
Lloyds is another bank that used this opportunity as a broader modernisation opportunity. Efforts to support the migration to ISO 20022 have been underpinned by the bank’s existing digital transformation and investment in innovation, observes Rogier van Lammeren, managing director, head of trade and working capital products. “Through this, we have developed a new ISO 20022-native payments platform which will play a definitive role in how we support the new standard,” he says. “We are already in the process of transitioning our international payment flow across to this platform.”
BNP Paribas is currently focused on ensuring a smooth transition by November 2025 for MT103, MT202 and MT202Cov to their MX counterparts. Regarding corporate-to-bank messages, which are not directly part of the interbank migration to ISO, the bank will continue to accept MT101 messages after November. However, the bank continues to encourage its customers to migrate to pain.001 messages to comply with the upcoming structured address requirements.

The new regional base will provide strategic, administrative, and corporate services, reinforcing BNY’s long-term commitment to the region. BNY already offers a range of asset servicing solutions in the Kingdom, including global custody services, institutional accounting, custody FX, and global risk solutions under its existing Capital Markets Authority license.
Hani Kablawi, head of international at BNY, said: ‘Today’s announcement underscores the strategic importance of the Middle East in BNY’s international growth plans and our commitment to being an enduring partner to our clients across the region.’
BNY has maintained a longstanding presence across the GCC, working with clients in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman. It most recently named Shadi Alnasr as its new market president for the Middle East region.
News of the expansion aligns with Saudi Arabia’s broader push to attract multinational corporations to establish regional headquarters in Riyadh.
The RHQ programme, launched in 2021 as part of Vision 2030, is designed to transform the Kingdom into a regional hub for business, foster job creation, and stimulate economic diversification. Under the initiative, companies with RHQ licenses receive a range of incentives, including relaxed regulatory conditions, tax exemptions, and preferential treatment in government contracting from 2024 onward.",306,1705,2025-05-01

The body of a New York City banker washed up on a beach in Spain — but his family continued searching for him for weeks because no one told them about the grisly discovery.
Grant Barr, a 37-year-old banker with BNY, disappeared on Jan. 28 while vacationing in Estepona on the Costa del Sol, mysteriously leaving only a pair of pants, passport and boating license on the beach.
His body washed ashore on March 3 but it was only identified in early April — meaning his family spent weeks desperately searching for him, not realizing he’d been found dead.
“After a week and back and forth between the courts and the coroner’s office, his remains were released on Friday and we were able to cremate him and finally bring him home,” Barr’s brother, James Barr, told the Spanish Eye about his brother.
“While the thoughts of a worst-case scenario came to mind from time to time, none of us actually thought this would ultimately be the outcome,” he continued.
James was frustrated that the report from Spanish police means “the last time we were all there searching for [Grant] two weeks he was already found, however, they didn’t even suggest that there was something they were looking into.”
Spanish authorities positively identified Barr using DNA, the family said. James, his other brother Luke and their mom immediately flew back across the Atlantic, where they met their father, who hadn’t left.
Officials have initially ruled his death a drowning.
“Our Brother passed on doing what he loved: facing the sea in its magnificent beauty and terrible might,” Grant’s brother Luke said in a statement through James.
Barr had traveled to Spain for a sailing getaway after going through a difficult breakup, according to EuroWeekly News.
His father, Michael, had previously recalled his son’s delicate emotional state before he vanished, including seeming paranoid about his family being in danger, according to the outlet.
Barr most recently worked at BNY, according to his LinkedIn profile. The New Jersey Institute of Technology graduate previously worked with other major corporations, including Citi.
“We are deeply saddened by the passing of our colleague, Grant Barr. On behalf of Grant’s coworkers and the entire BNY team, we wish to express our deepest sympathies to his family and will be supporting them at this incredibly difficult time,” a BNY spokesperson said.
Spain’s Guardia Civil and Policia Nacional have not commented on the new developments.",320,2551,2025-04-16

According to a statement from management at BNY (rebranded from BNY Mellon last year), the company is ""actively in negotiations"" to sell the building at 10 Mason St. The wealth management operation will continue at the location, through a ""leaseback arrangement.""
The four-story building at the top of Mason Street carries an appraised value of $27,474,600, according to the property-tax card on file at the town assessor's office, and its assessed value in 2024 for tax purposes is $19,232,220. The structure was built in 1954, according to town records, and the owner of record is the New York City-based bank.
According to BNY, the bank has been serving the Greenwich area since 1924. The company's web site said it has a number of financial experts working in the Greenwich office, and the ""team has particular expertise in multi-generational families, foundations, business owners in transition and divorce.""

Ethereum’s BlackRock deal is creating quite a stir right now in financial circles as the world’s largest asset manager takes a bold step into blockchain territory. Just a few days ago, on April 28, BlackRock went ahead and filed with the SEC to tokenize its massive $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, creating what they’re calling “DLT Shares.” This move, at the time of writing, represents the largest real-world asset flow to Ethereum yet and could change how big institutions approach cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in general.

How BlackRock’s Ethereum Deal Could Address Market Volatility and Regulation Challenges
BlackRock’s Treasury Trust Tokenization
The Ethereum-BlackRock deal basically involves tracking ownership of BlackRock’s Treasury Trust Fund through blockchain technology with BNY Mellon handling the records. This particular fund mainly invests in short-term US Treasury securities to provide those stable returns that investors are looking for.

BlackRock filed to tokenize its $150bn Treasury Trust money-market fund with a new “DLT Shares” class.
BNY Mellon will keep a blockchain mirror of every share on-chain.
Biggest real-world asset flow to Ethereum yet.
BlackRock also previously launched their BUIDL fund on Ethereum, which right now manages around $2.34 billion in assets. This new Ethereum-BlackRock deal kind of builds on their existing experience with institutional blockchain adoption.
Ethereum’s Position as Industry Standard
Ethereum currently has a pretty strong dominance in real-world asset tokenization with about 56% market share and approximately $6.2 billion in tokenized assets. This deal really reinforces this position even further.
Onchain Foundation head of research Leon Waidmann said:
“Institutions follow deep liquidity, credible neutrality, and battle-tested security. ETH is already their settlement layer.”
The Ethereum tokenization process seems to be becoming more and more attractive to major financial institutions that are looking for better efficiency and transparency in their operations.

BlackRock’s Vision for Blockchain Finance
BlackRock’s crypto investment strategy appears to be accelerating quite a bit lately. The firm’s leadership has made some pretty clear statements about their support for blockchain technology and its potential.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said:
“Tokenization will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.”
This Ethereum-BlackRock deal represents a significant step toward this vision of transformed financial markets with faster settlement times and more efficient capital use.
ETH Price Performance Despite Institutional Interest
Even with all the excitement around the Ethereum-BlackRock deal, ETH prices are still kind of subdued, hovering around $1,800 and down about 63% from those 2021 peaks we saw. The Ethereum market volatility continues to be a factor despite these positive institutional developments we’re seeing.
Interestingly enough, BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF has still accumulated approximately $162 million worth of Ether over just four trading days, which shows some institutional confidence despite the current Ethereum market volatility that we’re experiencing.

The fact that these two financial giants are collaborating on an on-chain valuation and reporting tool is set to have substantial effects on the crypto accounting and reporting conversation moving forward. Put simply, this tool will allow the posting of net-asset-value data directly on to select blockchains without relying on third-party accounting services. The involvement of on-chain money market fund, BUIDL, managed by Blackrock in addition to being the leading partner on this initiative, also highlights the growing importance of on-chain assets.
Benefits that have been discussed connected to this include 1) the ability of BNY to post NAV figures directly on chain, 2) enhanced credibility of tokenized funds thanks to increased transparency and real-time information, and 3) the ability of other products to benefit from more comprehensive suites of tools tailor made for tokenized information. The launch of the partnership also reinforces the rise of tokenized assets and other data, outside of traditionally decentralized instruments such as bitcoin and ether. While the project itself is still in early stages the implications of this real-time reporting and disclosure capability are significant in terms of allowing further maturation of tradeable products and services.
In addition the reporting functionality of Digital Assets Data Insights will have implications for the crypto accounting world; let’s take a look at a few of them.
Connecting Off-Chain Assets To Public Ledgers
One of the key aspects of BNY’s efforts is the connection that will be established between on-chain assets and off-chain data across blockchain networks. Specifically, and leveraging the data already managed on-chain by BNY, the institution will be able to broadcast select accounting data to the Ethereum network, amplifying the ability of investors to leverage public blockchain traceability and transparency. By also integrating smart contract functionality, customers will be able to automate data analytics and better integrate off-chain data and information alongside how public blockchains are used.
In short the efforts underway at BNY have the potential to unlock better transparency, traceability, and insights for tokenized products whether or not said instruments are stored on-chain or secured via off-chain mechanisms. These values of tokenized funds being posted directly on-chain also have the potential to accelerate conversations related to accounting, reporting, and disclosures.
Enhanced Reporting
An ongoing issue in the crypto and tokenized asset sector is the lack of standardized reporting and disclosures in the marketplace. While multiple private sector options have been put forward as potential options the reality is that there are still open items when it comes to critical accounting issues. These include not are limited to how to best determine valuation and liquidity measures for certain specific cryptoassets, products, or instruments and the consistency with which these pieces of information are reported to the marketplace. Accounting professionals will need to be aware of how these non-CPA generated reporting frameworks and best practices will influence client expectations going forward.
Obtaining more accurate and real-time data linked to the valuation of crypto instruments and investing options will also enable the increased proliferation of dashboards, KPIs, credit scores, and other data that is essential for widely traded investing products and services. One additional aspect of these changes is the impact and acceleration that more real-time data will have on a particularly tricky crypto accounting area; crypto-audits.
Mandate For Crypto-Specific Audits
The singular aspect of the cryptoasset landscape that has continued to lag behind the landscape at large, even as institutional adoption continues to accelerate is the development and proliferation of standardized crypto audit practices. With the FASB and IASB only having issued limited guidance to this point, and tax agencies taking varied approaches to crypto tax issues, the onus has fallen on the private sector to develop such practices. For example, the AICPA has developed and continued to update multiple practice aids related to accounting and attestation best practices for digital assets.
In addition the Digital Chamber of Commerce has also issued multiple whitepapers on the topic of proof-of-reserves, and although that practice continues to evolve the expectation is that some iteration of this concept will play a key role going forward. The efforts by BNY to enable more real-time valuation and (by extension) reporting and disclosure will only increase the appetite and interest in these ideas.

The building has been smashed and covered with paint
A city centre office block has been taped off after being targeted by vandals overnight.
Police are outside The Observatory, on Chapel Walks, this morning (April 14) after the building was smashed up and daubed in red paint.
The office is the Manchester base for the Aviva insurance company.
No-one has claimed responsibility for the incident so far, which is being investigated by Greater Manchester Police as criminal damage.
However, it comes almost five weeks after pro-Palestine protesters scaled the building on March 11.
Images from the scene show forensics investigators gathering evidence outside the building.
Glass windows and doors have been smashed, while red paint covers a large area of the building.
The damage appears similar to previous pro-Palestine protests in Manchester used against businesses such as Barclays and BNY Mellon.
A GMP spokesperson said: ""Officers are investigating following reports of criminal damage to a premises on Chapel Walks, Manchester.
""Enquiries are currently ongoing and anyone with any information is asked to contact police.""
Aviva has condemned the incident and vowed to take legal action.
A spokesperson for the company said: ""We have had some disruption at our Manchester office this morning (Monday, April 14).
""Our first priority is to ensure the safety of our people.
""We will not tolerate any criminal behaviour towards our people or property and will take appropriate legal action.

Just after dawn in London, a tier‑one bank’s treasury bot scans the liquidity position, matches it to day‑ahead cash‑flow forecasts and silently sweeps £210 million from a low‑yield reserve account into the overnight repo market. A risk notice and rationale land in the human treasurer’s inbox minutes later, but the decision, trade execution and journal entry were all performed end‑to‑end by software. Similar scenes are playing out in credit‑card pricing teams in Singapore and fraud‑monitoring squads in New York. The common actor behind them is agentic AI: autonomous, goal‑seeking systems that perceive, reason, act and, crucially, learn inside production environments.
Only eighteen months ago the conversation was still about prompt engineering. Today, the frontier has shifted to whether banks can allow software “colleagues” to run unsupervised for minutes, hours or even days. The answer is already a tentative yes, and the implications, commercial, operational and regulatory, are profound.
From generative to agentic: adding the feedback loop
Generative AI dazzled executives by spinning up text, code and images; yet it still required a human hand on the prompt. Agentic AI bolts a continuous feedback loop onto that capacity. The agent ingests streaming data, evaluates it against a set of objectives and constraints, decides on an action, executes the action via APIs or internal systems and then watches the outcome to refine its future policy. The World Economic Forum has described this closed‑loop autonomy as finance’s next step toward “process self‑governance.” It is not artificial general intelligence as each agent is still narrow, but when hundreds operate in concert, the functional perimeter of the firm begins to change.
Why finance?
Financial services deliver the very things agentic systems feed on: dense, structured data; repeatable, rule‑bound workflows; and markets that punish latency. The industry also suffers from margin compression: cost‑to‑income ratios at many global banks still sit uncomfortably above 50 percent, which makes even small efficiency gains valuable. Finally, customers transact around the clock. A human trader may pause for sleep; an agent never does.
Those conditions explain why banks, asset managers and insurers have become early laboratories. The work rarely makes front‑page news, but internal programme names: Quest IndexGPT, Eliza, GPT Store, are already part of everyday Slack chatter in the institutions that run them.
Quest IndexGPT: a data scientist that never clocks out
J.P. Morgan’s asset‑management arm went live with IndexGPT in May 2024. The tool asks an LLM to generate keywords around an investment theme, for example, “circular economy” or “quantum‑safe cybersecurity,” then pipes the list into a separate NLP engine that trawls filings and news, scores corporate exposure and re‑balances a real index. Human portfolio managers still sign‑off, but the cognitive lift has shifted to silicon. The bank touts faster time‑to‑market for bespoke thematic baskets and lower running costs for small, long‑tail indices that would have been uneconomic under a fully human process.
BBVA’s GPT Store: autonomy through crowdsourcing
Spain’s BBVA took a different route. In late 2024 it rolled out an internal GPT Store where any employee could publish an approved agent and any colleague could reuse it. Within four months the store held roughly 3,000 micro‑agents handling tasks from legal‑query triage to sentiment analysis of call‑centre transcripts. Licence utilisation among the initial user base exceeded 80 percent, a figure that astonished even the bank’s AI leadership team. The lesson: once knowledge‑workers taste autonomy at the task level, adoption can snowball without top‑down mandates.
BNY Mellon’s Project Eliza: custodianship meets ChatGPT
February 2025 brought another milestone when custody giant BNY Mellon announced a partnership with OpenAI to co‑develop Eliza, a proprietary agentic platform set to underpin every product line from securities services to payments. BNY’s chief information officer framed the move bluntly: “We no longer think of AI as a bolt‑on. It is the operating system of the bank.” The firm’s roadmap calls for thousands of self‑service agents, each governed by a central risk office but deployed and iterated by business users.
2025: the “year of the agent”
If these early adopters feel niche, consider the macro trend. Executives polled at the Reuters NEXT summit predict that autonomous agents will dominate the AI agenda in 2025, shifting boardroom metrics from top‑line growth to margin expansion as tasks that once consumed hours of analyst labour collapse to seconds of compute. Venture capital is shifting likewise: deal memos now obsess over agent‑centric architectures rather than foundation‑model bragging rights.
Goldman Sachs analysts go further. In a March 2025 note they argue that tomorrow’s infrastructure super‑cycle, billions in cloud capex, “hinges on AI agents” able to keep data‑centre utilisation above 90 percent and dynamically arbitrage compute across regions. In other words, the financial logic of the cloud itself may soon depend on autonomous software rulers.
Regulators step onto the pitch
Supervisors are anything but idle observers. Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) completed a thematic review of AI model‑risk controls in mid‑2024 and published a 28‑page information paper outlining expectations for generative and agentic systems, from data‑lineage tracking to kill‑switch design. A follow‑up circular on cyber‑risks highlighted the prospect of “malicious prompt injection” that could redirect an agent’s objectives without breaching the underlying model, an attack vector far subtler than SQL injection yet potentially as damaging.
Across the Channel, the EU’s AI Act put financial applications into its “high‑risk” tier, demanding technical documentation, human oversight and post‑market monitoring. Critics warn the Act’s product‑safety framing will age badly as agents evolve, but for now compliance officers must treat every credit‑scoring or robo‑advice agent as though it were a medical device. The Bank of England’s latest industry survey puts data protection, model explainability and talent shortages at the top of banks’ AI pain points, a hierarchy that neatly mirrors the MAS findings.
Governance moves from slides to source‑code
For years “human‑in‑the‑loop” was the comfort blanket of AI risk frameworks; agents force a harder conversation. The emerging consensus looks like this: the board sets an agent charter linked to enterprise risk appetite; a central AI risk unit validates models, red‑teams behaviours and signs off on every new objective function; immutable logs feed a real‑time dashboard monitored by operations staff authorised to pull the plug. Crucially, the fail‑safe is coded as a circuit‑breaker on specific metrics, market‑value‑at‑risk spikes, unexplained model drift, rather than a generic panic button. MAS explicitly endorses such role‑based, telemetry‑driven controls in its guidance.
Talent wars: less data scientist, more AI ops engineer
Autonomy also rewrites job descriptions. BBVA doubled its dedicated AI headcount to more than 400 in 2024 and opened “AI Factories” in Mexico and Turkey. The fastest‑growing title in this space is neither quant nor prompt engineer but “AI operations officer” professionals fluent in Basel III liquidity ratios as well as retrieval‑augmented generation pipelines. These hybrid operatives babysit swarms of agents, write policy tests and negotiate with regulators. Banks that fail to cultivate such talent risk strangling innovation in second‑line approvals; those that succeed gain an engine of perpetual experimentation.
Competitive lines are redrawn
Who is best placed to own the agentic future? The card schemes start with global authentication rails and data on billions of transactions; add decision autonomy and they could morph into de‑facto credit‑decision utilities. Hyperscalers control the foundation‑model stack and sell agent orchestration as a service; the danger for banks is dependency on computational landlords with competing retail ambitions. Incumbent banks retain the balance‑sheet licences and decades of labelled data, but they must move fast, often by taking equity stakes in start‑ups that supply agentic middleware.
The Path Ahead
By year‑end 2025, analysts expect agentic AI to run perhaps five percent of intraday liquidity buffers at global systemically important banks. The first supervisory stress‑tests that explicitly model agent failure channels are penciled in for 2026. And by 2027, at least one advanced economy may permit autonomous underwriting for retail loans, matched by a new “algorithmic accountability” statute somewhere in Asia. Whether these dates slip or accelerate, the trajectory points in only one direction: deeper machine agency over the financial stack.
“Trust, but verify”
Agentic AI is not just another incremental efficiency play; it is a delegation of decision rights that strikes at the orthodox structure of a bank. The upside is extraordinary: 24‑hour trading desks that never tire, personalised offers generated, and risk‑priced, in real time, operating ratios that finally look more like fintech than legacy finance. The downside, should governance fail, is systemic: black‑box trades, cascading model drift, concentration risk in a handful of foundation models.
The pragmatic path is already visible in the institutions leading the charge: small, revenue‑bearing pilots like IndexGPT; crowd‑sourced innovation sandboxes like BBVA’s GPT Store; platform‑level commitments like BNY’s Eliza; and regulator‑aligned guard‑rails that make every agent auditable by design. Banks that treat agents as genuine colleagues, complete with job descriptions, performance reviews and the occasional disciplinary memo, will convert the promise of autonomy into sustainable competitive advantage. Those that do not will discover, perhaps abruptly, that trust without verification is simply abdication.
Either way, when the markets open tomorrow morning, an invisible software co‑worker will already have taken the first trade. It is time the rest of us caught up.",524,10273,2025-04-23

He was tragically diagnosed with ALS on Valentine's Day 2024, while his wife Nicole was 6 months pregnant with their 3rd child. He was 6'5"" and known as a gentle giant. Chuck was born in Worcester, MA, on December 31, 1985, and was an active, playful kid and everyone wanted to be his friend. He was characteristically quiet, but had a dry sense of humor and kept everyone laughing. He grew up playing football and basketball, among other sports, attended Algonquin High School in Northboro, MA, played on the varsity football team, and worked at Northboro House of Pizza. He attended Assumption College in Worcester, close to home, played Division II football and met so many friends. He graduated with a degree in Accounting and his first full-time permanent job was at Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), where he worked for nearly 15 years. After college, he enjoyed his glory days in Southie, spent weekends boating in the summer, and watching the New England Patriots in the fall. He was an avid water skier and wakeboarder, and always talked about getting his own boat someday. He met his wife, Nicole, the love of his life, in June 2016 and they were married by the water at Danversport Yacht Club on September 14, 2018. His most precious gifts in life were his kids, Charlie (age 5), Alana (age 3.5) and Jenna (age 10 months). His lifelong dream was to be a stay-at-home father, which he ultimately did the last 14 months of his life. His primary caregivers during his journey with ALS were his wife Nicole; dad Chuck; sister Veronica; brother Greg; and best friend Lola, who all brought their strengths and areas of expertise to maintain his quality of life and keep him as comfortable as possible. Chuck was beyond patient and kept calm while everyone ""fumbled"" around him. Chuck is survived by his wife, Nicole (Benjamin); and his children, Charles (Charlie) Andrew Johnson, Jr., Alana Nicole Johnson, and Jenna Eleanor Johnson, whose names pay tribute to his initials CAJ. He is also survived by his parents, Charles and Theresa Johnson; sister Veronica Hecht and her husband Daniel; and his two nephews, David and Owen (his Godson); brother Gregory; sister Lauren Cholaghian and her husband Armen; in-laws, Roy and Nancy Benjamin; sister-in-law Michelle Benjamin; brother-in-law James Benjamin and fiancée April MacDonald; sister-in-law Emily Benjamin; grandparents, Peter and Gertrude Johnson and Michael and Catherine McEneney; and countless aunts, uncles, cousins, whom he loved dearly.

Trading and investing platform eToro has expanded its relationship with BNY to launch a fully-paid stock lending programme, enabling Europe-based users to earn passive income.
BNY will act as the custodian, while EquiLend Spire will identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
Yossi Brandes, vice president of execution services at eToro, comments: “Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions, and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way. Yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets.”
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+, and Diamond Club members, followed by lower-tier club members at a later date.
Eligible users will be given the option to opt into the programme, at which point their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending.
Once opted in, users will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earned in the specific period.
Only whole unit ‘real’ stock positions are eligible for lending, meaning that contracts for difference (CFDs) and fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.
Stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility, and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, according to eToro, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
This launch of stock lending represents an expansion of the growing clearing relationship between eToro and BNY, which utilises BNY’s Global Clearing platform, offering integrated solutions across US and international clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing.
Brandes adds: “Since the inception of our relationship, BNY has enabled us to expand our offering of investment opportunities through their global clearing and custody services, which provide the financial structure for our global, fully funded stock and ETF offerings across 19 exchanges.
“This new collaboration marks a significant step in our commitment to adding features and products to the platform that enrich the investing experience and help users to grow their knowledge and wealth.”

Data has become the lifeblood of wealth management firms, but managing it effectively poses numerous challenges. From data silos to disconnected technology, firms can struggle to find an enterprise view. And, if data isn’t harmonized across the organization, it’s hard to use for gleaning insights, growing businesses, and adapting to the fast-changing and demanding financial market.
Many wealth management firms have turned to the cloud for data management, but shifting data, pipelines and operations to the cloud is not a magic bullet. Firms also must have both a clear strategy and robust framework for maintaining the accessibility, catalogue, quality, and governance of their data. A secure data share can help an enterprise uphold these four pillars of cloud data management.
What Is a Data Share?
As its name suggests, a data share is a tool in a data consumption solution that shares data from one cloud-based account with other cloud-based accounts. More technically, a share is a package of data offerings on a cloud account that other data consumers can subscribe to. In addition, shared database objects are immutable, as they are read-only and cannot be altered.
BNY and Snowflake: A Powerful Data Share Team
The flexibility of a Snowflake share enables consumers to enhance their data sets, and they can then share data back with the provider1. With the data located in one place, consumers know where to find data, when they need it. Moreover, a unique differentiator of Snowflake is that there is no file transfer, which means data is immediately available for reading.
Clients without a Snowflake account can participate in a data share via an authentication process that links the client’s chosen cloud account to BNY’s Snowflake instance. In either circumstance, the near-instantaneous access to high-quality data offers firms the tools to collaborate, innovate, and grow.
Accessibility: The Key to Collaboration
Access to data is necessary for any aspect of wealth management—be it estate planning, investment management, business succession, and more. When teams across the enterprise can access data across the firm, they can collaborate more easily, which in turn enables them to:
- Solve business challenges to improve performance and outcomes.
- Drive innovation to create new products, services, and business models.
- Enhance differentiation to gain an edge over competitors.
With a cloud data share, data is accessible in near real time. In BNY’s Snowflake data share, BNY aggregates data from multiple sources and then makes it accessible to the consumer via either a subscription or authentication process. This way, data consumers within BNY and data consumers who are clients of BNY can easily access the data they need. In addition, since cloud updates are nearly instantaneous, consumers can be sure they are working with the latest information.
Catalogue: Benefiting from a Data Superset
Nevertheless, access to data is not enough. Consumers must also be able to find the right data at the right time. A data share offers a centralized, easy-to-use data catalogue. The distinct data marts in a share are large databases organized around a unifying principle. Just as a library has different sections (e.g., Fiction, Young Adult, Nature), a data share provider offers various data marts (e.g., Accounts, Transactions, Market Value). Within each share that consumers subscribe to, data is documented and organized.
For instance, one firm might only subscribe to streaming custody data, but another may subscribe to both streaming data and the derived data that provides performance information. Regardless of their subscription details, both firms can:
- Scan and index data sources across platforms and environments
- Identify the gaps and overlaps in their data landscape
- Optimize data storage and performance
The result is a wealth management data superset fit for purpose. Data consumers know what data assets they have, where they are, how they’re structured, and who owns them.
Quality: Confidence Behind Innovation
Knowing where and how to find data is great, but data integrity and quality are also critical to addressing business needs. On the one hand, a share mitigates version control issues that can arise from repeated consumer use. Since a share is read-only, the number of consumers who download, interrogate, and examine the data will not affect its quality.
On the other hand, a share enables providers to set up automated functions that scan the data and measure key quality metrics. Snowflake, for example, offers pre-defined data metric functions (DMFs) to monitor the data’s quality, but it also enables other data share providers to customize their own DMFs, schedule assessments, and define when alerts regarding quality should be instigated.
In addition, a share can provide real-time data quality dashboards and reports that enable you to track and visualize the quality of your data, thereby reducing errors, risks and the time spent evaluating data for inconsistencies.
Governance: The Foundation for All Pillars
Governance is the set of policies, standards, and processes that define how data is collected, stored, accessed, and used across the enterprise. Cloud-based data governance can provide the tools and workflows to manage data policies, roles, and permissions. A data share enhances:
- Compliance: Knowing the state of your data and where it is helps you meet regulatory and industry standards
- Accountability: With clearly delineated roles and responsibilities among data stewards and engineers of a data share, teams can rely on quality data and meet client and partner goals.
- Data-driven culture: Accurate, easily accessible data fosters data literacy across the organization.
Data governance, then, is inextricably linked to data inventory, quality, and accessibility. Most important, a data share implements all encryption, backup, and recovery policies, as well as subscription rules and access requirements.
Cloud-Based Data Share Is the Future
Cloud-based data platforms offer tools to access, explore, and visualize data for various types of reporting and analytics. A secure data share is the foundation for an effective and scalable way to access high-quality data when and where you need it.
An experienced partner, an interoperable platform, and fit-for-purpose products, such as a data share, can help wealth management firms scale their operations in the cloud. By adopting best practices and using the right tools for data inventory, quality, governance, and accessibility, firms can overcome longstanding data challenges and successfully create and sustain a modern culture of data-driven growth.

The deployment marks a major step in BNY’s strategic approach to risk management, as the firm leans into advanced artificial intelligence to detect and mitigate compliance-related risks across its operations.
The adoption of Behavox Quantum was carried out as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution, integrating seamlessly across BNY’s communication platforms and supporting more than 16 languages. This wide coverage ensures consistent compliance oversight across its global footprint. The initiative is powered by Behavox’s Quantum AIRP platform, which delivers AI-driven insights to help identify potential conduct and compliance issues in real time.
BNY head of global compliance assurance Tom Wileman said, “Core to BNY’s mission is identifying, assessing and mitigating risks across our organization as we execute on our strategy. By leveraging Behavox’s technologies, we’re helping to elevate our compliance monitoring and strengthen our holistic approach to risk management.”
Behavox Quantum is designed to interpret both structured and unstructured data, transforming corporate communications into actionable intelligence. This allows organisations to proactively identify and respond to behavioural risks, rather than relying solely on reactive measures. The system’s scalability has been a key factor in its successful implementation at BNY.
Behavox chief revenue officer Nabeel Ebrahim said, “Our work with BNY is a template on how to implement enterprise technology at scale; through collaboration, a focus on process and technology oriented problem solving.”
The collaboration underscores a growing trend among financial institutions to integrate AI-powered solutions into their risk and compliance frameworks. As regulatory scrutiny intensifies and the volume of corporate data increases, firms like BNY are turning to intelligent systems to manage complexity and improve governance.

ClearToken’s ambition has expanded from being a CCP to becoming a central securities depository (CSD). We suspect that’s a lot to do with achieving legal finality of settlement.
“DvP (delivery versus payment) settlement system operators are typically regulated intermediary FMIs such as CSDs and in FX markets CLS Group provides a payment versus payment (PvP) mechanism,” the startups writes.
The alternatives are to settle via a centralized exchange or prime broker, to settle directly on chain, or to use a single venue clearinghouse, such as Citadel Securities’ backed EDX Markets. A key benefit of a CCP over a single venue clearinghouse would be less fragmented liquidity. The paper focuses on the drawbacks of the other two options.

EXHIBIT #1: U.S. EQUITY HOLDINGS DECLINE
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
By announcing sweeping tariffs, the U.S. is fundamentally changing its role in the global trading order. There are also uncertainties about the relative attractiveness of U.S. financial assets to overseas investors. It’s only been a few days since the tariff announcement on April 1, and the volatility of financial assets may obscure clear conclusions at this early stage, but early implications shed some light on how international investors are treating U.S. equities, Treasurys and the dollar. Initial conclusions suggest an air of caution in cross-border investment flows.
Let’s start with equities. We have argued, with evidence (see here, for example), that there is waning demand for U.S. equities following a long period of outperformance through most of the post-pandemic period. Until late last year, that is. As Exhibit #1 shows, U.S. equity holdings have been in almost steady decline since early December last year. Our 2025 annual outlook foreshadowed an end to so-called American exceptionalism, and we have indeed observed this phenomenon quite clearly. While U.S. holdings have declined since the end of last year, there has been a clear shift in equity allocations to Europe. Of course, there has been an appreciable drawdown in equity exposure across the world since tariffs were announced, as both U.S. and Eurozone equities have repriced lower on the news.
Again, we emphasize that it’s too early after the tariff storm has been unleashed to extrapolate short-term movements into long-term trends, but this is one that has persisted for a while, and one which makes a lot of sense. U.S. valuations had become stretched and market depth narrow, while growth prospects abroad were less ebullient – to say the least – than in the U.S. However, with tariff uncertainty now at its apex, and the effects on the U.S. relative the rest of the world equally uncertain, the unique attractiveness of U.S. assets is significantly diminished.
EXHIBIT #2: WHERE HAVE CROSS-BORDER INVESTORS GONE?

Overseas demand for U.S. Treasurys has been a key concern of ours, and something we watch closely. Exhibit #2 shows cumulative daily flows (a way of measuring longer-term movements in underlying demand) since the beginning of 2024. As the chart shows, outside of the resolution of the 2024 debt ceiling episode, when cross-border investors piled into new T-bill issuance, flows have been mixed at best over this period. Note, in particular, over the same period – early December last year – when equity flows left the U.S. and headed into the Eurozone, U.S. Treasury flows have been generally underwater.
U.S. fiscal uncertainty is one plausible explanation, and again something we have been concerned about since the election. Extending the 2017 tax cuts will cost an estimated $4.5trn over the next 10 years, and it’s not clear that tariffs and budget cuts can offset the red ink from this policy. Static analysis suggests around $600bn per year will be raised from tariff revenues, but changing import behavior, declining domestic demand for higher priced and harder-to-source imports, and changing trade patterns could lead to merely half (or less) of that annual revenue actually being realized.
Yields on bonds outside the United States are competitive. Furthermore, fixed income investors typically hedge their overseas sovereign exposure back to local currency. Hedging costs for covering UST investments back into euros, for example are now at their highest level since mid-2022, at 2.1% reduce the overall take-home yield on, say, a 10y US T-note paying 4.2% by around half, whereas 10y German Bunds currently yield 2.6% in local terms, without the bother and volatility of hedging.
This is not to say that safe haven buying of USTs will no longer take place during times of market stress, and undoubtedly, the move in the 10y yield to below 4% at the end of last week was at least partially the result of a flight to safety. We have daily data on UST flows from abroad, shown in Exhibit #3. Thursday, April 3, the day after the tariff announcement, saw one of the biggest one-day inflows from abroad in several years. However, within a day, this flow had almost fully reversed and by yesterday was slightly negative. Total (i.e., cross-border and local) flows were still quite high on Friday, April 4 and Monday, April 7, but the absence of significant cross-border flow suggests it was primarily from U.S.-based investors.
EXHIBIT #3: A ONE-DAY RUSH INTO SAFE HAVENS, BUT PRECIOUS LITTLE OTHERWISE

These data are of great importance and something we monitor constantly. Tuesday’s barely passing 3-year auction and upcoming additional coupon placements the rest of this week could be illustrative of overall cross-border demand. The upcoming budget debate is also key, as we try to account for any increases in the deficit over the next several years. Our bias is to expect more – not less – red ink, potentially crimping demand from abroad.",459,5348,2025-04-09

Analysts and investors will be watching to see if banks tweak their 2025 earnings forecasts.
The magnitude of the tariffs announcement on April 2 ""seems to have caught many off guard,"" Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent research note. ""While it occurred after 1Q25 was in the books, it could reverberate through the tone of management discussions on their earnings calls, as well as on their annual outlooks that were provided in January.""
Given the recent chaos, tariffs and the economic outlook ""now take center stage,"" Scott Siefers, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote this week in a research note. ""We doubt we'll get all the answers we want with earnings, but at least banks will have the chance to respond to the emerging backdrop and to shape expectations about how they will perform within it.""
Trump had vowed to stick with his tariffs plan even as market volatility unfolded. The banking sector was hard-hit, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index sinking 15% between April 2, when the tariffs were announced, and April 7. Two days later, Trump abruptly changed his mind and said he would pause tariffs on most countries for 90 days. The index rose 9% that day.
Bankers have had to digest a lot since the beginning of the year. Following Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, the administration has issued a barrage of orders, such as threatening (and then implementing) steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada; telling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a bank regulator, to

This reflects the growing sophistication of a new class of tokenized funds operated by firms like BlackRock, which will be the first to use the new BNY tool.
The launch represents a fresh foray by BNY into the volatile blockchain sector, which has been buoyed by a favorable U.S. regulatory landscape as President Trump pushes a pro-crypto agenda at every level of government. In March, BNY head of digital assets Caroline Butler testified before the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing on stablecoins.
“Embracing blockchain technology in connecting the traditional and digital markets is consistent with BNY’s long track record of supporting innovation in the global financial system,” she said at the hearing.
In an interview with Fortune, Butler said the new product will allow more up-to-date transparency around tokenized funds—a fast-growing new category of funds, which resemble traditional funds but where the underlying assets are recorded and transferred on the blockchain. BNY’s new product can, in turn, improve the credit rating of the funds.
“Because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this,” she told Fortune. “It sits right in that sweet spot as we continue to add more and more value for clients.”
On-chain data
While the crypto sector began in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin, traditional financial institutions like BNY have been hesitant to enter the space, largely because of regulatory uncertainty. Still, BNY has shown an interest in the technology, including launching a digital asset custody platform that allowed clients to hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, with the bank.
The plan, however, clashed with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden Administration, which issued guidance surrounding balance sheet requirements for companies holding crypto assets for clients.
After putting its custody product on hold and continuing to build out its tokenization capabilities, BNY received an exemption in 2024 that allowed it to custody Bitcoin and Ethereum held for exchange-traded products without it being treated as a balance-sheet liability, and soon after received approval to hold crypto assets for other purposes. Under Trump, the SEC quickly rescinded the previous guidance, known as SAB 121, which was broadly unpopular among banks and crypto firms.
BNY’s latest crypto product moves beyond custody, and reflects the growth of financial instruments launched on blockchains, such as BlackRock’s on-chain money market fund, BUIDL. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, has publicly argued that more and more financial assets will be tokenized to improve cost and efficiencies, though the technology has still been limited to specific pilots and a largely blockchain-native customer base.
Put in simple terms, the new tool will allow BNY to post the net asset value, or NAV, for tokenized funds directly onto the blockchain, rather than having to rely on the accounting of third-party services to furnish this information. Butler said that the product will help investors see the up-to-date NAV of financial instruments such as BUIDL, which in turn will drive more creditworthiness.
While Butler acknowledged that this type of data sharing is not unique to crypto, she said that BNY’s blockchain enables the company to offer a fuller suite of tools around tokenized funds. “It’s just a use case to demonstrate how you can actually now start to make information more available to everybody that needs it,” she told Fortune.
BlackRock, which relies on BNY as the fund administrator and custodian for BUIDL, will be the first client to use the tool. “BNY’s enablement of off-chain data insights to public blockchains is an unprecedented event and a significant milestone for the industry,” said Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a statement shared with Fortune.
As BNY continues to push into the digital asset space, Butler said that it will expand the data product to other companies offering the tokenized fund based on client demand, though she declined to share whether BNY is working on additional blockchain tools. “We have the opportunity to operate at all parts of that fund life cycle and the assets life cycle,” she said.",357,4494,2025-04-03

As a result you may not be as well positioned to benefit when the market bounces back.
So despite it feeling counter-intuitive, Mr Norton suggested it is worth looking at selling safe income assets, such as bonds, and buying more equities to get back to your desired weighting.
“We are not saying we are at the market bottom, we are aligning the level of risk of the portfolio to where the investor wants to be so that when the market does bottom out they have the market allocation they want to benefit from the bounce,” Mr Norton added.
Consider buying bonds
However, that does not mean you should disregard diversification. Mr Norton said that fixed income assets, primarily bonds, are the most important asset class often overlooked by investors.
He suggests that high quality bonds are currently offering good returns for a low level of risk.
Ed Monk, of broker Fidelity International agrees, despite noting that the risk of higher inflation traditionally makes fixed income assets less attractive as it erodes the value of the amount they pay.
However, Mr Monk said: “High quality government bonds begin to look very attractive when returns from riskier assets, like shares, are in question. Unlike corporate bonds issued by companies, that face a raised risk of default during a recession, government bonds carry very low default-risk.”
Mr Khalaf added: “So far this year the typical global equity fund has seen its value fall by 9.4pc. For a typical cautious managed fund, which holds a maximum 60pc in shares, the fall has been just 1.4pc.

BlackRock will work with BNY Mellon in creating a new class of Distributed Ledger Technology shares for the fund.
What to know:
- BlackRock is introducing a digital share class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust fund, utilizing blockchain technology through BNY Mellon.
- The new shares will use blockchain to mirror share ownership records, potentially leading to broader adoption of digital assets.
- BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has highlighted the potential of tokenization and warned the U.S. could lose financial dominance if it fails to manage its debt.
BlackRock partnered with BNY Mellon to bring blockchain to the back office of one of its largest funds, filing to offer a digital share class of its $150 billion Treasury Trust money market fund through BNY Mellon.
The new “DLT Shares,” short for distributed ledger technology, won’t hold crypto. BNY Mellon, the fund’s exclusive distributor, intends to use blockchain to mirror share ownership records, an incremental step that could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenized cash, digital assets, or blockchain-based settlement infrastructure in traditional finance.
In the past few years, a growing number of firms have experimented with creating blockchain-based representations of real-world assets (RWAs), bringing the traditional finance world rapidly into the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. Earlier Wednesday, Libre said it was tokenizing $500 million of messaging platform Telegram's $2.4 billion debt and bringing it to the TON blockchain.
BlackRock's Liquidity Treasury Trust Fund is part of the firm’s Liquidity Funds suite and managed over $150 billion in assets as of April 29. The DLT share class has a minimum investment requirement of $3 million for institutional buyers, with no minimums on subsequent purchases. The SEC filing is preliminary and subject to approval.
The move isn’t BlackRock’s first into tokenization. Its blockchain-native BUIDL fund, created in partnership with Securitize, now manages over $1.7 billion in assets and recently expanded onto Solana.
CEO Larry Fink has consistently emphasized his belief in the long-term potential of tokenization and decentralized finance. In his 2025 annual letter to shareholders, Fink warned that the U.S. risks ceding its financial dominance if it fails to control its debt, a vulnerability that could accelerate investor interest in alternatives like bitcoin
“If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control … America risks losing [its reserve currency status] to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink wrote. “Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage.”

UPDATE (April 30, 7:29 UTC): Adds third paragraph on tokenization trends, rewrites headline.

KuCoin Hits Record Market Share as 2025 Volumes Outpace Crypto Market
KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market.
What to know:
- KuCoin recorded over $1.25 trillion in total trading volume in 2025, equivalent to an average of roughly $114 billion per month, marking its strongest year on record.
- This performance translated into an all-time high share of centralised exchange volume, as KuCoin’s activity expanded faster than aggregate CEX volumes, which slowed during periods of lower market volatility.
- Spot and derivatives volumes were evenly split, each exceeding $500 billion for the year, signalling broad-based usage rather than reliance on a single product line.
- Altcoins accounted for the majority of trading activity, reinforcing KuCoin’s role as a primary liquidity venue beyond BTC and ETH at a time when majors saw more muted turnover.
- Even as overall crypto volumes softened mid-year, KuCoin maintained elevated baseline activity, indicating structurally higher user engagement rather than short-lived volume spikes.

BNY's First-Quarter 2025 Market, Wealth Services Income Rises
The firm reported a broadly buoyant set of financial numbers for its different business divisions.
The market and wealth services business segment of BNY, the New York-headquartered group, said it logged pre-tax income in the first quarter of 2025 of $816 million, up 20 per cent on the same period a year earlier.
The market and wealth services business includes the Pershing business, which provides investment servicing and other services to wealth managers, family offices, and other financial institutions.
Total revenue stood at $1.686 billion in Q1 2025, rising 11 per cent on a year earlier, BNY said in a statement late last week.
Assets under custody/administration at the end of March were $14.7 trillion, rising 12 per cent.
In the securities services business segment, pre-tax income stood at $708 million, rising 20 per cent.
Across the whole of BNY, it had assets under management of $2 trillion, little changed on a year earlier. Diluted earnings were $1.58 per share in Q1 2025, rising 26 per cent, it said. The pre-tax operating margin was 32 per cent.
At the end of March, BNY had a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.5 per cent, up from 10.8 per cent a year earlier. The ratio is a standard international yardstick of a bank’s capital shock absorber. BNY returned $1.1 billion of capital to common shareholders through a mix of buybacks and dividend payments.

EXHIBIT #1: TOP 25 S&P500 DRAWDOWNS
Source: BNY, Bloomberg
The focus on retail over institutional money flows has been a long-standing tradition. Compared to larger institutional flows, retail has smaller tickets, trades less frequently and has a higher correlation to trend. However, in times of stress, retail buyers can help define tops and bottoms for markets via the animal spirits they unleash. There is a Wall Street adage learned during Covid and Meme stock eras saying to “never to fade retail flows”. Buying a 2% dip in the S&P500 makes money, but some analysts argue this is a sample error from the last 5 years. Many of the current U.S. retail traders in stocks have less than 10 years of experience, meaning they missed the pains of 1987, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2007 and 2008. The bigger question is whether there is a signal that can help differentiate when retail is proven wrong.
Our take
The last 5 years have had a 10% return using a straightforward process: buy-the-dip when the S&P500 moves more than 2%, hold for 1 month, then sell. This method has worked 75% of the time. The holding period could be longer, but that increases risk and volatility versus reward. The notable lesson post-Covid has been that markets are orderly and protected by policy expectation shifts. Retail investors have learned this lesson and were key drivers for overall market shifts in sentiment. The problem arises when drawdowns in equity markets are larger than 2%. The last 75 years of the S&P500 show that buying the dip doesn’t work, and instead loses 75% about 7% of the time. Buying during a bigger drop in stocks is only successful when the Fed eases. The bounce back last week was due to the pause on tariffs causing policy shifts, not monetary policies. Trade talk will prove if these changes are sufficient.
EXHIBIT #2 : IFLOW U.S. SECTOR CORRELATION VS. VIX
Source: BNY, Bloomberg
Our view
In the last 3 weeks of trading, investors saw a sharp rise in the VIX index, suggesting volatility was overwhelming returns. Our data suggests that institutional investors cut back risks in an orderly outflow. These changes can all been linked to uncertainty around U.S. tariffs and policies. Notably, in March and April our flow showed less stock picking and broader stock indices trading. This is where institutional flows and retail flows interact. Buying U.S. shares on the biggest outflows were mostly in ETFs linked to the S&P500 and the NASDAQ 100. The Magnificent 7 also played a role but little else was bought otherwise. The correlation between sectors for our institutional flows peaked last week and has since fallen from 0.55% correlation. This suggests a broad market deleveraging, rather than any one sector or set of stocks being sold. The April 3 and April 4 retail buying against ongoing volatility peaking stands out in our flows, showing “retail” interest at 2-3 times the normal amount for the month.
Forward look
The key component for equity market instability is how stocks trade as a market or a diversified bottom-up set of equity names, albeit at elevated volatility. Some of this information shows up cyclically in earnings seasons. Micro meets macro over the next 3 weeks while retail takes a pause and waits for institutional flows to lead. We see a high correlation of trading ETFs to retail dominance over institutional uncertainty.
EXHIBIT #3 : INSTITUTIONAL VS. RETAIL FLOW FOR U.S. EQUITIES
Source: BNY
On April 3 and 4 our data was dominated by retail flows volume spiking to 2-3 times the normal amount. Buying the SPY and VOO ETFs (S&P500) accounted for most of the flows, supported by some Magnificent 7 names. The lack of retail buying in fixed income ETFs over the last month started to switch this week but remains lower than January or February levels.
The role of “buying the dip” relates to the view of how long markets can last in a volatile and negative return state. The problem for investors simply following the retail buyer - or just buying every big dip in markets - is that this method can fail. The start of Q2 equity market trading has been notable for its volatility and persistence. Historically, the top 25 biggest S&P500 drawdowns show that only 25% have positive returns. This is a warning shot for April 2025, and I bought this dip. Outsized moves down have a tipping point linked to volatility and the state of the economy. The shocks of 1987 and 2008 were memorable, but still less painful than post-March 2020. The risk for the rest of April rests on how the FOMC reacts to financial conditions. The history of 2008 trading suggests you need bigger policy turn to get the dip to work.",345,4845,2025-04-18

- But don't let the negative sentiment stop you from buying stocks, some say.
- Four strategists share why the negative sentiment surrounding tariffs is overblown.
Thanks to the trade war, Americans are feeling downright awful about the economy. The latest University of Michigan consumer survey reported an 8% decline in sentiment from March, as consumers worried about inflation, unemployment, and their financial situation.
It's not only consumers — the American Association of Individual Investors recently reported the 12th consecutive week of a negative bull-bear spread, meaning that more investors were bearish than bullish on the stock market.
However, a growing cohort of market experts is shunning the doom-and-gloom narrative that the economy is on a collision course with recession. In their opinion, the bad vibes aren't quite aligning with reality. After all, corporate earnings are strong, the labor market is in good shape, and households have robust balance sheets.
Their advice? Don't let the negative news discourage you from buying into the stock market at a discount now. Often, overly bearish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator for a market rebound. Here's why these four strategists are keeping a cool head on tariffs and are ultimately optimistic about the market.
Alicia Levine, head of investment strategy and equities, BNY Wealth
To Levine, extremely low investor sentiment means that it's unlikely for markets to fall much further.
""Recession's on everybody's lips, and in some ways, that's a really good thing because, as you know, when the market is expecting something, the news of it itself is less likely to cause a downside whoosh,"" Levine told BI. ""The market has de-risked a lot of the downside scenarios.""
Ultimately, the stock market crash and negative sentiment are all self-inflicted by Trump, meaning that there's nothing wrong with the underlying economy, Levine said. On the bright side, any change in policy can also greatly reduce the chance of a recession.
Trump has shown himself amenable to negotiations, as he floated the idea of scaling back tariffs on China earlier this week. Levine believes that some sort of tariff deal will be struck before the 90-day tariff pause is up.
""There's some expectation that this is the peak of the tariffs, and so, as those move lower, that would seem to feed into the sense that there is right tail here,"" Levine said.
Tony DeSpirito, global CIO of fundamental equities and portfolio manager, BlackRock
DeSpirito, who oversees several income and value funds including the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), has never been too concerned about Trump tariffs ruining the economy. Back in March, DeSpirito said on Bloomberg that it was a mistake for banks to be downgrading their stock market outlooks, and he's held steady to that view.
""Periods of uncertainty are actually great buying opportunities. Once the uncertainty abates, companies are very adaptive,"" DeSpirito told BI.
Right now, DeSpirito is seeing opportunities in healthcare services, medical devices, aerospace, and defense companies.
""In healthcare, I'm finding a lot more opportunity in services than I am in large-cap pharma. Large cap pharma has a lot of issues around where they locate their intellectual property,"" DeSpirito said. ""A number of them have large patent expirations that are upcoming.""
DeSpirito thinks the market is overly focused on the risk and overlooking opportunities down the road. He's confident that kinks in trade policy will be ironed out soon.
""In addition to greater certainty around trade, you'll also get deregulation, which will be a positive for the market and when you think about tariffs as a source of revenue, that revenue source will create more flexibility on the policy side,"" DeSpirito said.
Jonathan Curtis, chief investment officer, Franklin Equity Group
Tariff concerns have led many investors to diversify outside the US stock market, but Curtis believes the ""sell America"" narrative is overblown.
Instead of fleeing to international stocks, Curtis believes investors should be doubling down on US leaders like the Magnificent Seven. Especially now that many of the Big Tech names are down roughly 20% from all-time highs, Curtis sees a good opportunity for investors to add to their positions in high-quality companies for cheap.
""This productivity gain that we're going to get from artificial intelligence is going to be profound and those companies, many of them Mag 7, hold the keys to that,"" Curtis said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22.
Curtis is also bullish on defensive sectors like healthcare, where demand for treatments will remain constant no matter what part of the economic cycle we're in. He sees innovations in GLP-1 medications and AI driving sustained future growth for the healthcare sector.
""Those businesses are as good as they were over the long term prior to Inauguration Day, and those companies are incredibly well-positioned for what's about to come,"" Curtis said of the Magnificent Seven.
Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy, ClearBridge Investments
It's easy to buy into a doomsday recession narrative, but Schulze doesn't see much evidence to back it up. There's been a lot of talk about how consumer sentiment is at historic lows, but actions are more important than sentiment itself, he said.
""In this cycle in particular, it's more important to watch what people do rather than what they say, because when you look at the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, it's been low and declining, yet consumption has been fairly broad-based over the last couple of years,"" Schulze said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22.
US consumers might not feel so optimistic, but numbers show they're in great shape. Household debt levels are low, and many homeowners locked in low mortgage rates, insulating them from their biggest monthly expense, according to Schulze.

This innocuous sounding product is rather important. And while not rocket science, it is groundbreaking. The world’s largest global custodian will be feeding data about the assets it is administrating directly to public blockchains. In some ways, that’s better than an audit, because it’s up to date and directly from source.
In the recent past there has been a lot of debate about so-called ‘proof of reserves’, which in some cases are prone to manipulation. Proof for real world asset (RWA) tokenization is even more important because the token is often a digital twin that represents an asset held outside a blockchain. In the case of a money market fund, the assets often involve Treasuries.
So far the best we’ve seen in terms of proof is a pdf downloaded from a fund accounting system and posted to the internet. If someone wanted to commit fraud, it would be incredibly easy to automatically tweak and upload fraudulent data. The Circle stablecoin is somewhat better because its reserves are mostly managed by BlackRock, which posts the assets in the fund to its website on a daily basis.

BNY spent the week engaging with clients and policymakers and came away believing that businesses and governments are settling in for a longer period of heightened uncertainty. Within an evolving geopolitical, economic and market environment, three key themes were consistent across our conversations.
1. The Pursuit of Growth is Universal, but Increasingly Regional
At the beginning of the year, our experts wrote about the megatrends driving the growth outlook and how each are changing economies, both advanced and emerging. The world has shifted significantly since, but across jurisdictions the focus remains on pursuing policies that boost growth. That pursuit is taking place within the context of changes in trade routes, monetary and fiscal policies, regulatory approaches, industrial support and the impact of AI and blockchain.
In response, public and private sector leaders are looking to boost domestic sources of growth while reshoring, or “friendshoring,” industries to protect against an uncertain global landscape. In the first four months of the year, home bias is apparent. Japanese investors are buying JGBs over U.S. Bonds. EU investors are buying German Bunds. The consequence of increased volatility since March has shifted risk and reward ratios making EUR and JPY compete with the USD as safe havens. U.S. asset selling has been notable since the start of the year and doesn’t look done yet, despite the relief rally in bonds and stocks in April. We expect more regionalization moving forward, but we also expect global investment flows to remain an important component of the growth story.
2. Adaptability Matters
For countries and businesses large and small, navigating this evolving landscape will require adaptability. What came through in our conversations last week was the importance of dynamic budgeting, scenario planning and risk management. During periods of heightened uncertainty and volatility, it is critical to be prepared for all outcomes, particularly as global economic and geopolitical shocks become more of the norm and less so outlier events.
On the global stage, some countries have already quickly recognized their new reality and moved to secure opportunities that elevate their own geopolitical standing, boost economic growth and drive prosperity.
Business leaders face similar risk and reward moments, particularly as innovative technologies — such as AI and blockchain — look to fundamentally change how we live and work. Positioning a business — its balance sheet, operational structure and global footprint and its employees — to remain flexible and adjust quickly to evolving geopolitical, economic and market developments is now table stakes. Failing to do so will leave businesses caught flat-footed and unable to meet their growth potential.
3. 'Opting Out' is Not an Option
Operating in this new environment also means that “opting out” of change is not an option. Every day at BNY, we see our clients around the world who are increasingly adopting pragmatism, new operating models and partnerships with each other. They are doing this to increase their own resilience, to scale and to achieve profitability in the world as it exists now, not the way they wish it to be.
That sentiment has now permeated the public sector. Across our conversations last week, officials recognize that maintaining the status quo is impossible. Change is necessary, expected by their constituencies and needs to move at pace. A good case study is what has transpired in Europe over the first four months of this year: simplifying regulation, boosting market connectivity and driving further investment into economies. Many of these changes will take time to materialize in the data, but we see the appetite for change having a durable impact on business and the public sector for the foreseeable future.",331,4034,2025-04-30

This strategic move highlights BNY’s commitment to enhancing its operations in the Middle East, according to a statement.
The RHQ located in Riyadh will deliver strategic, administrative, and corporate services for BNY throughout the Middle East. BNY’s existing Asset Servicing solutions available for clients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia include Global Custody Services, Global Risk Solutions, Custody FX, and Institutional Accounting under a Capital Markets Authority license.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is delivering on its Vision 2030, and we will continue to bring BNY’s expertise across the financial lifecycle to help the KSA achieve its ambitions,” said Hani Kablawi, head of International at BNY. “Today’s announcement underscores the strategic importance of the Middle East in BNY’s international growth plans and our commitment to being an enduring partner to our clients across the region.”
Saudi Arabia’s incentives for foreign firms
Riyadh has been actively aiming to attract more companies to establish their regional headquarters in the kingdom by offering tax breaks, as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seeks to diversify the economy away from oil by drawing in foreign investment.
Saudi Arabia’s new rules stipulate that foreign firms must have regional headquarters in the kingdom in order to access lucrative government contracts. In May 2024, Goldman Sachs received a license to set up its regional headquarters in Riyadh, while U.S. lender Citigroup secured a similar approval late last year.
Middle East: A growing market for global banks
The Middle East has emerged as a vital growth market for global banks like BNY, propelled by a surge in sovereign wealth fund activity, substantial infrastructure investments, and the expansion of capital markets across the Gulf. As regional economies diversify away from oil and attract foreign capital through reforms and regulatory enhancements, international financial institutions are increasing their presence to seize new business opportunities in asset servicing, custody, and advisory.
The new regional headquarters in Riyadh will provide strategic, administrative, and corporate support for BNY’s operations across the Middle East, according to the custodian bank.
BNY has a decades-long history of working with clients in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman, providing access to global markets, developing local market infrastructure capabilities, and supporting the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s capital markets landscape.",310,2745,2025-05-01
