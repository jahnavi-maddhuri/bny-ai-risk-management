EXHIBIT #1: RISING VOLATILITY ACROSS THE G10 AND EM COMPLEX
Source: Source: BNY Markets, Bloomberg
Our take
Tariff uncertainty and heightened volatility have led to a surge of risk aversion. The sharp asset repricing has triggered some capitulation and the liquidation of trading patterns, with significant intraday volatility across asset classes in foreign exchange, equities and fixed income. This market stress can be observed in a widening of the cross-currency basis, a widening of credit spreads, including on higher-rated investment-grade corporate bonds, and greater equity and currency volatility. The volatility this week has been indiscriminate, with no currency or region spared. As shown in Exhibit #1, both emerging market and G7 currency volatilities have been moving in tandem compared with the more common differentiation of market volatility in a particular region. For example, emerging market FX was more volatile in Q4 2024, before being overtaken by the G7 region in the first quarter of this year. This situation was exacerbated by the response of the U.S. bond market. In contrast to the flight to quality bid on bonds, the U.S. Treasury curve bear steepened significantly, with 2-10y curve at 70bp, nearly 30bp steeper on the month, and 30y U.S. Treasurys hitting a high of 5% before settling around 40bp higher on the month.
This led to a surge in bond volatility, with the MOVE index, which measures U.S. bond market volatility, soaring past its November 2024 highs. Indeed, the MOVE index is at its highest level since September 2023, when the U.S. Federal Reserve telegraphed that it might keep rates higher for longer.
Forward look
At the time of writing, there is no sign of global trade tensions easing, with the U.S. imposing a record 125% import tariff on China, and China retaliating with tariffs as high as 84% on U.S. products. In response to U.S. tariffs, the European Union has approved retaliatory tariffs on around €21bn of U.S. goods, and Canada is reported to be imposing a 25% tariff on certain vehicle imports from the U.S. In other words, tariff uncertainty is here to stay, not to mention the risks of a further tightening of trade restriction in critical sectors.
EXHIBIT #2: EURO SCORED HOLDINGS
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Our take
The ECB policy meeting next week will be crucial for determining the direction of travel for the euro in the near term. ECB members seem to be shifting toward further rate cuts despite the less dovish tone at the March meeting, saying the trade war will have a “non-negligible” direct impact on the economy and warning about the disinflation threat from the euro’s strength. Euro appreciation this year has been spectacular, from testing 1.01 in early February to moving above 1.10 in April, a gain of nearly 6% year to date. Looking at the pricing dynamic of the euro in recent days, we have noticed an unusual dislocation, with EUR/USD going higher and a narrowing of the bond spread. The 2-year Eurozone and U.S. Treasury yield spread narrowed this week, driven by a lower Eurozone yield and a higher U.S. Treasury yield. This dislocation might continue for technical reasons but is typically not sustainable.
Forward look
Looking at iFlow, aggregate euro flows have been strong. iFlow data, especially from cross-border transactions, showed persistent short covering in Q1 2025, at almost as fast a pace as the liquidation that occurred in Q4 2024. As shown in Exhibit #2, euro scored holdings from cross-border investors, at around -1, are narrower than at the beginning of 2024. Looking at the euro as a whole, the currency’s high valuation might have resulted in some selling pressure. Indeed, iFlow showed weekly euro outflows for the first time this week after 11 straight weeks of inflows since mid-January 2025. Trading will continue to be volatile up ahead given the downside growth risk in the Eurozone, the direction of monetary policy and continued cross-border investor demand for the euro as a diversification play.
EXHIBIT #3: APAC WEEKLY AVERAGE SCORED FLOW
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Our take
The reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S. hit Asia hard, especially China, which was slapped with a minimum tariff of 125%. Most APAC countries face high reciprocal tariffs, with the exception of Singapore, which is subject to the minimum tariff of 10%. Other APAC countries saw high tariff rates, too, including Vietnam at 46%, followed by Thailand (36%), Taiwan and Indonesia (32%), India (26%), South Korea (25%), Malaysia (24%) and the Philippines (17%). Though there might be some consolation in the 90-day period for lower 10% reciprocal tariffs on non-retaliating countries, tariffs will likely pose significant downside growth risks to the region. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has said that the tariffs imposed by the U.S. and any retaliatory levies by other nations will adversely impact domestic economic activity.
APAC equities have experienced severe market volatility in recent days, including a 13% selloff on the Hang Seng Index, the bourse’s largest one-day selloff since October 1997. And Taiwan equities recorded a decline of 10% on Monday, the biggest one-day drop on record. Foreign investor sentiment about equities has been bearish and shows no signs of improving. This was especially true in South Korea, where foreign investors have sold over $6bn in equities so far in April, more than the previous high of $5.7bn net sold in September 2024. Similar selling pressure can be seen across the APAC region, including in India and Taiwan.
APAC foreign exchange price action has been volatile as markets must navigate between risk-off and a capital outflow-triggered selloff against the softer U.S. dollar-induced rallies in foreign exchange. Capital outflows and uncertainty have won the argument. This and the loosening of the PBoC’s grip on the Chinese yuan have exacerbated the downside risk for Asian currencies. China’s official daily CNY fixings breached 7.20 this week, the first time since September 2023 and USDCNH reached historic highs this week, with an intraday high of 7.4290.
Forward look
In the context of the acute market uncertainty, capital outflows and negative market technical features, the selloff in APAC currencies over the past week has been relatively contained. Indeed, looking at iFlow, the weekly average scored flows for APAC currencies has been broadly positive, led by CNY, HKD, KRW and SGD, with outflows in MYR and IDR (see Exhibit #3). The observed inflows cannot be entirely explained by the unwinding of hedges, as overall investor flows in the government bond complex have been positive. One primary stabilizing force in the region, in our view, is the stepped-up smoothing activities by regional central banks, notably Bank Indonesia, which intervened in onshore IDR and offshore NDF. A similarly firm intervention stance can be seen in Taiwan, where USDTWD is kept firmly at a critical level of 33.0. While the pressure continues for APAC currencies, we do not expect depreciation momentum to be unhinged. We will continue to monitor asset flows as a swing factor for Asian currencies."

Fabian Khoshbakht, head of treasury services for Asia Pacific (APAC) and global head of client insight and innovation for treasury services explained that under the new model, treasury services is less siloed. “By simplifying, streamlining and collaborating through cross-functional teams, we create more intuitive client journeys and improve our ability to anticipate unmet needs.” He acknowledged that the transformation is still in progress but said it has already led to greater agility and a new culture of commerciality. “We are going to market much faster, because of how the platform’s operating model has enabled teams to deliver goals using agile ways.” Khoshbakht explained that the change is more than operational. “We are an enabler,” he said. “Leveraging our infrastructure, data and insights—we are empowering our clients to solve their business challenges.” This is particularly significant in Asia Pacific, where financial institutions (FIs) operate in diverse markets with varying regulatory, technological and competitive landscapes. BNY’s ability to deliver global consistency while adapting to local client needs will be critical to supporting APAC clients in the long run. Expanding payments and liquidity access for FIs in APAC BNY’s institutional payments business in APAC is evolving alongside client demand for faster, more reliable and more transparent cross-border infrastructure. The bank supports over 2,000 FIs globally and processes $2.5 trillion in payments value each day, and over 100 currencies served in foreign exchange (FX) payments. This infrastructure enables regional and local FIs to access dollar clearing, improve operational predictability and broaden corridor coverage. Jonathan Hickey, market manager for payments product, described BNY’s payment franchise as one of scale and neutrality. “We do not serve retail or corporate clients for transaction banking in APAC, and that is important,” he said. “We do not compete with our clients for their end customers; we enable our clients to support their customers.” He positioned BNY’s payments infrastructure as a platform that enables other FIs to scale globally and optimise performance without conflict. “We enable our clients to scale and adapt without having to build everything themselves.” Hickey also detailed how this strategy plays out across APAC corridors. He highlighted a collaboration with Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) to deliver near real-time inbound payments into Australia. “The solution allows BNY’s global clients to have funds received in under 60 seconds by Australian beneficiaries, regardless of the bank in which the beneficiary uses domestically,” he said. “We handle the inbound transaction and connect to the real-time payment rails in Australia.” Fabian Khoshbakht, head of treasury services for Asia Pacific (APAC) and global head of client insight and innovation for treasury services at BNY Jonathan Hickey, market manager for payments product at BNY BNY is also collaborating with the National Australia Bank (NAB) to enhance its cross-border service for payments into Australia through NAB’s real-time payments solution. Carl Slabicki, executive platform owner for treasury services at BNY, said, “This [collaboration] improves the customer experience by offering more convenient and transparent transactions and provides a competitive advantage in the market.” In Korea, BNY worked with iM Bank, formerly Daegu Bank, to activate a SWIFT Go to automated clearing house (ACH) capability. “We built a service that allowed them to send low-value cross-border payments, which we then convert into local ACH batches. That made it viable for them to offer the service to their clients.” Hickey also pointed to BNY’s use of smart routing to ensure that cross-border payments are processed through the most efficient corridors, depending on currency, counterparty and destination market. Carl Slabicki, executive platform owner for treasury services at BNY Junyi Kuah, head of international cash management solutions highlighted the introduction of virtual accounts for FI clients in 2024. “Our implementation supports both collections and payments.” He noted that BNY’s virtual accounts also allow FIs to open sub-ledger accounts under their clients’ names. “This is especially useful for our Asia-based clients that want to offer US-based collection services to their end customers but do not have domestic capabilities,” he said. Embedding data and AI to enhance delivery and client enablement Khoshbakht presented BNY’s progressive use of data and artificial intelligence (AI) as part of a broader effort to modernise service delivery, drive internal productivity and create better client outcomes. He explained that the goal is to transform the client experience by embedding data directly into the infrastructure and servicing model, moving beyond static reporting or post-event analysis. Khoshbakht said, “Data is part of how we deliver. It helps us pre-empt issues, support our clients more intelligently and run more resilient operations.” He illustrated the shift with specific internal initiatives. “We have reduced exceptions in our payments business by applying machine learning,” he noted. “We use predictive models to help identify when a payment might fail, and we can intervene before it breaks.” He said that the improvement in straight-through processing (STP) rate has been enabled increasingly by AI to reduce the remaining friction. Beyond automation, the focus is on visibility and enablement. “We are using data to surface insights that our frontline teams can act on,” he said. “That includes operational performance, risk triggers and relationship context. We want to give our people the tools to help our clients.” Khoshbakht stressed that AI deployment is measured and targeted. “We are focused on where it solves a problem—whether that is exception management, client escalation, or internal process improvement.” He noted that while data and AI are often marketed as futuristic or transformational, BNY’s application is grounded in operational discipline. “We are solving very real problems—manual workarounds, fragmented processes, inconsistent visibility—and we are doing it at scale,” he said. Khoshbakht acknowledged that expectations from clients are rising. “We are investing our technology to meet those expectations, and we do that with accountability.” Strengthening implementation and service delivery with an integrated client model Amy Tong, international head of client implementation and service for APAC as well as Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), outlined how BNY has evolved its approach to client onboarding and servicing to support the growing client needs internationally. “The business is becoming more complex, and expectations are rising; hence the capability to enable our client experience seamlessly is key,” she said. “We are seeing clients launch products quickly and expect infrastructure and providers like us to move just as fast.” She noted that clients expect a trusted institution like BNY to provide real-time, on-demand access to onboarding progress and servicing updates, particularly when operating across markets and time zones. To meet this challenge, BNY has developed a more integrated client servicing framework that bridges the end-to-end client journey powered by data and proactive engagement with clients. “We’re building greater alignment across the entire value chain with a client-focused mindset.” Junyi Kuah, head of international cash management solutions at BNY Amy Tong, international head of client implementation and service for APAC at BNY Building scalable trade finance infrastructure through digital connectivity BNY’s approach to trade finance in APAC focuses on enabling scalable access to the global trade ecosystem without requiring clients to build out their own infrastructure. The bank acts as an intermediary and enabler, offering correspondent connectivity, message intermediation and compliance filtering through its Trade Network Access Service (TNAS). Angelia Toh, trade finance structurer for treasury services in Asia Pacific, introduced TNAS as a response to the challenges posed by the shrinking network of active relationship management application (RMA) in the documentary trade space. “There is a cost to maintaining the monitoring, the know-your-customer (KYC) and the documentation required,” said Toh. She explained that TNAS helps financial institutions bridge this gap by enabling them to route letters of credit (LCs) and trade messages through BNY’s active correspondent network. “We act as the first advising bank, stepping in to advise and forward the LC, while facilitating the compliance, workability and documentation checks,” Toh said. “This allows banks that may not have direct RMA (relationship management application) coverage to continue supporting their clients without operational disruption.” The service was formally launched in early 2024, following two years of piloting. “Mizuho in Japan and Golomt Bank in Mongolia were among the early adopters,” she said. “And since its launch, we have seen strong interest from banks across different parts of the region.” Toh stressed that TNAS is not just about message routing. “We are adding value by performing compliance checks before the message is sent,” she said. This pre-validation step, she noted, helps reduce disputes and rejections, especially when dealing with less familiar counterparties or complex LC structures. The platform is accessed through a secure, self-service portal that allows banks to view where BNY has active RMAs, submit requests for new coverage and track the status of transactions. “We have built it to be intuitive and flexible,” Toh said. “You can see in real time whether we can advise or confirm a transaction for a given counterparty.” One additional feature of TNAS is its support for LC confirmation and discounting, providing risk mitigation for banks that are unable or unwilling to take on exposure to certain issuers. Toh emphasised that “We are not competing with our FI clients. Our role is to make trade connectivity simpler, more reliable and more scalable.” The adoption of TNAS, particularly in APAC, reflects the broader trend of financial institutions seeking to preserve trade capabilities while reducing overhead and compliance complexity. “It is not always economical for FIs to maintain bilateral RMAs for every possible counterparty,” she said. “But through TNAS, we can extend that access on their behalf.” Extending infrastructure to underserved markets and FIs BNY’s treasury services strategy in APAC includes a deliberate focus on FIs and markets that have traditionally lacked access to reliable correspondent infrastructure. This includes new digital banks, niche regional players and institutions operating in emerging markets with limited USD clearing options or access to global networks. Yew Fei Yeow, head of treasury services for South and Southeast Asia, outlined BNY’s engagement with these underserved segments. “Many of these institutions are at an early stage of growth,” he said. “We see long-term value in supporting their growth and providing access to global clearing and payment infrastructure.” He highlighted how BNY has worked with newly licensed digital banks in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. “These banks have limited or no presence outside their home markets, and they look to us to provide capabilities that they don’t have,” Yeow said. “We can offer them access to USD clearing, liquidity and payment rails that they would otherwise need to build from scratch.” BNY’s ability to support these clients rests on its neutral position as a non-competing infrastructure provider. “That makes us a more acceptable provider for institutions that might otherwise be wary of working with providers that also have retail ambitions,” said Yeow. Angelia Toh, trade finance structurer for treasury services in Asia Pacific at BNY Yew Fei Yeow, head of treasury services for South and Southeast Asia at BNY In Cambodia, BNY is supporting local FIs by collaborating with them in their digital transformation journey. “The Cambodian banks show strong interest in familiarising with the evolving regulatory environment while improving their compliance standards,” he said. “We are a trusted advisor who regularly engages the local regulator and commercial banks, and can exchange viewpoints to help them, as they navigate their management of compliance and operational risk.” Yeow acknowledged that onboarding and compliance remain critical hurdles in some of these markets. “We believe in investing in long-term relationships. Once the infrastructure is in place, it opens up many more possibilities for the client.” Aligning global infrastructure with regional execution BNY’s execution in APAC demonstrates a methodical extension of its global platform strategy—bringing together infrastructure, technology and institutional servicing in a model that emphasises enablement. The region’s complexity, shaped by regulatory diversity and varying levels of digital maturity, has made it a proving ground for the bank’s unified operating approach. Across payments, trade finance and servicing, the bank remains focused on delivering infrastructure that supports FIs' ability to scale without having to replicate global capabilities internally. Whether through its role as a USD clearing service provider, an intermediary for documentary trade, or a provider of integrated onboarding and servicing, BNY consistently positions itself as a neutral and reliable counterparty. BNY’s investments in data and AI, while targeted, are enabling it to move toward more predictive and transparent operations—supporting both its internal teams and clients in managing complexity and exceptions. Meanwhile, its outreach to underserved segments, including digital banks and institutions in emerging markets, reflects a long-term strategy to embed itself into the foundational infrastructure of developing financial ecosystems. What remains is the challenge of continuing to meet rising expectations in transparency, configurability and time-to-value, particularly as fintechs and digital-native institutions reshape service benchmarks. BNY’s platform model provides a scalable foundation—but its regional success will ultimately depend on how well it continues to adapt that foundation to the specific demands of its APAC clients."

In terms of profits, revenue and earnings per share, the first three months of the year marked BNY's best first quarter on record. Net income was $1.15 billion, up 21% from the same period last year. Earnings per share were $1.58, beating analysts' estimates of $1.51, according to S&P. And revenue was $4.79 billion, surpassing expectations and marking a 6% increase from the year-ago period.
Even so, CEO Robin Vince struck a cautious tone in a call with journalists on Friday.
""There's clearly been some signs of optimism at the beginning of the year, but we've now seen a reversal of sentiment, which has been driven by uncertainty,"" Vince said. ""So we now have quite a few things on the minds of market participants.""
The CEO said a number of factors contributed to this uncertainty, first and foremost the seesawing tariff policies of the Trump administration. Vince said he sees the flux as part of a long-term negotiation strategy, which means businesses will have to wait a while for the ""final picture"" to come into focus.
""Last week's tariff announcements were clearly part of a broader strategy to try to reset relations between the U.S. and the rest of the world,"" he said. ""It's our expectation that these negotiations are going to take some time, and this uncertainty will likely have some length to it.""
Like other banks, BNY saw its stock take a hit after Trump imposed tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners. In the two days after the announcement, BNY's stock dropped by
The combination of uncertainty and stock volatility has created challenges for BNY — but also opportunities, Vince said. ""At times of uncertainty in markets, we're kind of viewed as a port in a storm,"" he said. ""And so the uncertainty actually attracts people to our platform, because they see us as this sort of rock of stability.""
In the first quarter, fee revenue reached $3.4 billion, a 3% increase from last year. Net interest income jumped 11% year over year to $1.16 billion.
BNY's sale of a Toronto-based trust company also boosted first-quarter revenue. BNY sold the business to the Australian stock transfer company Computershare in March. In the first quarter, BNY said it gained $40 million from the sale.
Overall, analysts at Truist called it a ""good but not outstanding"" quarter for BNY.
""We still like BK stock here for its status as one of the most defensive banks combined with the growth and offense made possible by recent investments,"" David Smith, vice president for banks equity research at Truist, wrote in a research note.
With roots dating back to 1784, BNY is one of the oldest banks in the world. But in recent years, it's been betting big on some of the newest financial technologies. In 2022, BNY

The reversal, which came less than a week after Trump's inauguration, was so sudden that it caused some whiplash during a recent interview with one of BNY's executives. At a conference hosted by UBS in February, Emily Portney, BNY's head of asset servicing, said the bank was proud to be ""one of the very few institutions"" that can have custody of digital assets.
That prompted a puzzled reaction from the moderator, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken. ""I thought that was against the rules,"" Hawken said.
In the call with reporters on Friday, Vince said crypto regulations are needed to set the ""rules of the game,"" but the particular rule BNY ran up against, SAB 121, ""didn't make any sense."" The fact that it's now been rescinded, he said, is helpful to BNY as it continues to provide platforms for digital assets.
""There have been some impediments to full participation from a regulatory point of view,"" Vince said. ""We haven't let that stop us."""

The fact that these two financial giants are collaborating on an on-chain valuation and reporting tool is set to have substantial effects on the crypto accounting and reporting conversation moving forward. Put simply, this tool will allow the posting of net-asset-value data directly on to select blockchains without relying on third-party accounting services. The involvement of on-chain money market fund, BUIDL, managed by Blackrock in addition to being the leading partner on this initiative, also highlights the growing importance of on-chain assets.
Benefits that have been discussed connected to this include 1) the ability of BNY to post NAV figures directly on chain, 2) enhanced credibility of tokenized funds thanks to increased transparency and real-time information, and 3) the ability of other products to benefit from more comprehensive suites of tools tailor made for tokenized information. The launch of the partnership also reinforces the rise of tokenized assets and other data, outside of traditionally decentralized instruments such as bitcoin and ether. While the project itself is still in early stages the implications of this real-time reporting and disclosure capability are significant in terms of allowing further maturation of tradeable products and services.
In addition the reporting functionality of Digital Assets Data Insights will have implications for the crypto accounting world; let’s take a look at a few of them.
Connecting Off-Chain Assets To Public Ledgers
One of the key aspects of BNY’s efforts is the connection that will be established between on-chain assets and off-chain data across blockchain networks. Specifically, and leveraging the data already managed on-chain by BNY, the institution will be able to broadcast select accounting data to the Ethereum network, amplifying the ability of investors to leverage public blockchain traceability and transparency. By also integrating smart contract functionality, customers will be able to automate data analytics and better integrate off-chain data and information alongside how public blockchains are used.
In short the efforts underway at BNY have the potential to unlock better transparency, traceability, and insights for tokenized products whether or not said instruments are stored on-chain or secured via off-chain mechanisms. These values of tokenized funds being posted directly on-chain also have the potential to accelerate conversations related to accounting, reporting, and disclosures.
Enhanced Reporting
An ongoing issue in the crypto and tokenized asset sector is the lack of standardized reporting and disclosures in the marketplace. While multiple private sector options have been put forward as potential options the reality is that there are still open items when it comes to critical accounting issues. These include not are limited to how to best determine valuation and liquidity measures for certain specific cryptoassets, products, or instruments and the consistency with which these pieces of information are reported to the marketplace. Accounting professionals will need to be aware of how these non-CPA generated reporting frameworks and best practices will influence client expectations going forward.
Obtaining more accurate and real-time data linked to the valuation of crypto instruments and investing options will also enable the increased proliferation of dashboards, KPIs, credit scores, and other data that is essential for widely traded investing products and services. One additional aspect of these changes is the impact and acceleration that more real-time data will have on a particularly tricky crypto accounting area; crypto-audits.
Mandate For Crypto-Specific Audits
The singular aspect of the cryptoasset landscape that has continued to lag behind the landscape at large, even as institutional adoption continues to accelerate is the development and proliferation of standardized crypto audit practices. With the FASB and IASB only having issued limited guidance to this point, and tax agencies taking varied approaches to crypto tax issues, the onus has fallen on the private sector to develop such practices. For example, the AICPA has developed and continued to update multiple practice aids related to accounting and attestation best practices for digital assets.
In addition the Digital Chamber of Commerce has also issued multiple whitepapers on the topic of proof-of-reserves, and although that practice continues to evolve the expectation is that some iteration of this concept will play a key role going forward. The efforts by BNY to enable more real-time valuation and (by extension) reporting and disclosure will only increase the appetite and interest in these ideas.
As TradFi continues to adopt crypto, some of the largest institutions are looking to shake up the crypto accounting landscape."

eToro is working with BNY, which will act as the custodian, and stock lending platform EquiLend, which will identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+ and Diamond Club members, followed at a later date by lower-tier Club members.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way. Yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets. Leveraging BNY’s Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,” said Yossi Brandes, VP Execution Services at eToro.
Eligible eToro users will be given the option to opt into the programme, at which point their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending. Once opted in, they will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earned in the specific period.
Only whole unit ‘real’ stock positions are eligible for lending, meaning that CFDs and fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share. Stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
eToro users who lend their stock temporarily give ownership of the stocks to the borrower and lose voting rights while the stock is on loan. However, they can still receive dividends, sell the stocks or opt out of the programme at any time at no cost.
This launch of stock lending represents an expansion of the growing clearing relationship between eToro and BNY which leverages BNY’s Global Clearing platform, offering integrated solutions across US and international clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing. Through a jointly-created value proposition, the firms have developed a scalable global operating model enabling eToro’s underlying client base to access over 19 exchanges globally.
Yossi Brandes adds: “Since the inception of our relationship, BNY has enabled us to expand our offering of investment opportunities through their global clearing and custody services, which provide the financial structure for our global, fully funded stock and ETF offerings across 19 exchanges. This new collaboration marks a significant step in our commitment to adding features and products to the platform that enrich the investing experience and help users to grow their knowledge and wealth.”
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with eToro, supporting a holistic solution set across clearing, settlement, custody, foreign exchange, cash management. This development represents the very best of eToro, Equilend and the heritage and innovation of BNY’s world-class platform, as investors look to access a cutting edge feature in their investing journey,” said Victor O’Laughlen, Head of Global Clearing at BNY.
“The collaboration between EquiLend Spire and eToro marks a significant advancement in the securities lending market, enabling eToro to enhance its services with a fully paid lending program that benefits from cutting-edge technology. This move not only demonstrates EquiLend Spire’s commitment to innovation but also eToro’s dedication to providing efficient and modern financial solutions to its users,” said Dan Dougherty, Managing Director, Global Head of Sales & Account Management at EquiLend.

Trading and investing platform eToro has expanded its relationship with BNY to launch a fully-paid stock lending programme, enabling Europe-based users to earn passive income.
BNY will act as the custodian, while EquiLend Spire will identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.

eToro announced today (Thursday) the launch of a stock lending program that will allow its users in the UK and Europe to earn passive income by lending their stocks to borrowers. The Israeli fintech is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors in the online retail trading market, including Robinhood, which has been offering similar solutions for some time.
Passive Income with eToro
The initiative represents a significant expansion of eToro's existing relationship with BNY, which will act as the custodian for the new offering. Stock lending platform EquiLend will identify potential borrowers and facilitate the lending process.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it's been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way,” said Yossi Brandes, VP of Execution Services at eToro.
“Leveraging BNY's Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,” he added.
The program will initially be available to higher-tier eToro Club members—those with Platinum, Platinum+, and Diamond status—before being extended to other users at a later date.
eToro has been in the spotlight recently due to its planned IPO on Nasdaq under the ticker ETOR. The latest market disruption caused by Donald Trump's tariff announcements has led the company to pause its IPO roadshows as it “evaluates market conditions.”
How It Works
Users who choose to participate must opt in, after which their entire portfolio of eligible stock positions will be considered for lending. Only whole unit “real” stock positions qualify. CFDs and fractional shares are excluded.
Participating users will receive monthly statements tracking their income when their stocks are successfully loaned out. Securities with low market liquidity, high volatility, and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings.
While stocks are on loan, users temporarily transfer ownership to borrowers and forfeit voting rights. However, they continue to receive dividends and retain the ability to sell their stocks or opt out of the program at any time without incurring costs.
How Mach Can You Earn
While not explicitly detailed in the initial announcement, eToro has provided a formula in its help center for calculating potential earnings.
“Participants will receive monthly payments, equivalent to 50% of the net revenue eToro earns and receives from our partners for these lending transactions. The actual income from stock lending will likely vary from month to month depending on the market demand for the stock,” eToro explains in their FAQ.
The final values will depend on which assets are lent, the number of shares, and the variable lending fee, which fluctuates due to market supply and demand.
In eToro's example, they indicate that the lending fee rate is 1%, the facilitation and maintenance cost is 15%, and eToro's revenue share is 50% (remember those values are not fixed). The example referenced a relatively substantial investment of 2,000 Tesla shares at a price of $350 each, totaling $700,000. How much does eToro offer for a loan lasting 112 days (nearly 4 months) with this amount? Just over $925.
Is that a lot? Considering that the funds are already tied up in stocks, it's certainly a nice bonus and additional “dividend” from owning shares. However, for retail investors with typically much smaller portfolios, the profits will likely be rather symbolic.
For comparison, the stock lending program introduced by Swissquote, which has been functioning since 2024, offers an annual interest rate of over 5% for selected, most popular stocks. However, looking at Robinhood's offering, which implemented a similar solution in 2022, the terms are very comparable. The same applies to the Stock Yield Enhancement Program (SYEP) Derivatives introduced by Interactive Brokers in 2023.
Therefore, it can be concluded that eToro is not deviating from market averages in this regard.
Expanding Financial Access
Through BNY's Global Clearing platform, eToro's users can access over 19 exchanges globally, with integrated solutions for clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing.
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with eToro, supporting a holistic solution set across clearing, settlement, custody, foreign exchange, cash management,” Victor O'Laughlen, Head of Global Clearing at BNY, commented on the expansion. “This development represents the very best of eToro, Equilend and the heritage and innovation of BNY's world-class platform.”
eToro is providing educational resources on its platform to help users understand potential income opportunities and risks associated with stock lending.
Dan Dougherty, Managing Director, Global Head of Sales & Account Management at EquiLend, noted that the collaboration “marks a significant advancement in the securities lending market,” enabling eToro to enhance its services with a fully paid lending program.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued guidance noting that while securities lending may generate extra returns, it can also introduce additional risks, including counterparty and collateral shortfall risk. The authority unveiled some measures in 2023 to curb securities lending to retail investors.
As FinanceMagnates.com informed this week, Shir Shalom, who led various projects related to risk management at eToro, has announced her departure from the financial trading platform after serving nearly four years in various leadership roles. “Forever an eTorian,” she wrote on her socials."

And while earnings season typically includes a fair share of reflection on banks' performance during the prior three-month period, this time things are different. The
Will the tariffs push the U.S. economy into a recession?
Analysts and investors will be watching to see if banks tweak their 2025 earnings forecasts.
The magnitude of the tariffs announcement on April 2 ""seems to have caught many off guard,"" Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a recent research note. ""While it occurred after 1Q25 was in the books, it could reverberate through the tone of management discussions on their earnings calls, as well as on their annual outlooks that were provided in January.""
Given the recent chaos, tariffs and the economic outlook ""now take center stage,"" Scott Siefers, an analyst at Piper Sandler, wrote this week in a research note. ""We doubt we'll get all the answers we want with earnings, but at least banks will have the chance to respond to the emerging backdrop and to shape expectations about how they will perform within it.""
Trump had vowed to stick with his tariffs plan even as market volatility unfolded. The banking sector was hard-hit, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index sinking 15% between April 2, when the tariffs were announced, and April 7. Two days later, Trump abruptly changed his mind and said he would pause tariffs on most countries for 90 days. The index rose 9% that day.
Bankers have had to digest a lot since the beginning of the year. Following Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, the administration has issued a barrage of orders, such as threatening (and then implementing) steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada; telling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a bank regulator, to
Banks have also had to account for interest rates and how the higher-for-longer environment might shake out this year. In March, the Federal Reserve

Banks have been eager for the Fed to lower rates after hiking them in recent years. Lower rates would mean reduced deposit costs and potentially more commercial loan growth. And some banks could get some relief in
Analysts and investors will be looking for any signs of loan growth during the first quarter and the lending outlook for the rest of the year amid the tariff uncertainty.
Siefers, in his note, said large-bank loan growth and fee income are at risk, but net interest income outlooks ""should hold in OK for now"" and capital levels remain strong.

Labour TD George Lawlor has criticised the government’s response to the closure of BNY Mellon in Wexford, calling the Taoiseach’s reply “watery” and lacking urgency.
The Wexford TD has submitted a formal query to the Minister for Enterprise Peter Burke, seeking clarity on the future of the affected site and workers.
Speaking on Morning Mix Mr Lawlor has condemned the company’s handling of the closure as shoddy and questioned why Wexford was targeted over Dublin or Cork.
George is the labour spokesperson on enterprise tourism and employment has dismissed relocation offers to Dublin as unviable for most staff due to family, housing, and schooling concerns"
