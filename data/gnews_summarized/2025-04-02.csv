This reflects the growing sophistication of a new class of tokenized funds operated by firms like BlackRock, which will be the first to use the new BNY tool.
The launch represents a fresh foray by BNY into the volatile blockchain sector, which has been buoyed by a favorable U.S. regulatory landscape as President Trump pushes a pro-crypto agenda at every level of government. In March, BNY head of digital assets Caroline Butler testified before the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing on stablecoins.
“Embracing blockchain technology in connecting the traditional and digital markets is consistent with BNY’s long track record of supporting innovation in the global financial system,” she said at the hearing.
In an interview with Fortune, Butler said the new product will allow more up-to-date transparency around tokenized funds—a fast-growing new category of funds, which resemble traditional funds but where the underlying assets are recorded and transferred on the blockchain. BNY’s new product can, in turn, improve the credit rating of the funds.
“Because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this,” she told Fortune. “It sits right in that sweet spot as we continue to add more and more value for clients.”
On-chain data
While the crypto sector began in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin, traditional financial institutions like BNY have been hesitant to enter the space, largely because of regulatory uncertainty. Still, BNY has shown an interest in the technology, including launching a digital asset custody platform that allowed clients to hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, with the bank.
The plan, however, clashed with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden Administration, which issued guidance surrounding balance sheet requirements for companies holding crypto assets for clients.
After putting its custody product on hold and continuing to build out its tokenization capabilities, BNY received an exemption in 2024 that allowed it to custody Bitcoin and Ethereum held for exchange-traded products without it being treated as a balance-sheet liability, and soon after received approval to hold crypto assets for other purposes. Under Trump, the SEC quickly rescinded the previous guidance, known as SAB 121, which was broadly unpopular among banks and crypto firms.
BNY’s latest crypto product moves beyond custody, and reflects the growth of financial instruments launched on blockchains, such as BlackRock’s on-chain money market fund, BUIDL. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, has publicly argued that more and more financial assets will be tokenized to improve cost and efficiencies, though the technology has still been limited to specific pilots and a largely blockchain-native customer base.
Put in simple terms, the new tool will allow BNY to post the net asset value, or NAV, for tokenized funds directly onto the blockchain, rather than having to rely on the accounting of third-party services to furnish this information. Butler said that the product will help investors see the up-to-date NAV of financial instruments such as BUIDL, which in turn will drive more creditworthiness.
While Butler acknowledged that this type of data sharing is not unique to crypto, she said that BNY’s blockchain enables the company to offer a fuller suite of tools around tokenized funds. “It’s just a use case to demonstrate how you can actually now start to make information more available to everybody that needs it,” she told Fortune.
BlackRock, which relies on BNY as the fund administrator and custodian for BUIDL, will be the first client to use the tool. “BNY’s enablement of off-chain data insights to public blockchains is an unprecedented event and a significant milestone for the industry,” said Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a statement shared with Fortune.
As BNY continues to push into the digital asset space, Butler said that it will expand the data product to other companies offering the tokenized fund based on client demand, though she declined to share whether BNY is working on additional blockchain tools. “We have the opportunity to operate at all parts of that fund life cycle and the assets life cycle,” she said."

Fannie Mae, BNY Accused of Inflating Rates on Loan Foreclosures
Home lenders and their partners have been cheating New Yorkers by inflating what they owed on home equity loans that fell into foreclosure, according to lawsuits filed Thursday.
The systematic miscalculations diverted thousands of dollars from people who fell behind on loans, homeowners said in documents filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York. The discrepancies allegedly stem from improperly charging compound interest instead of simple interest for the time span from when lenders ask the court to authorize a sale and when the motion is granted."

The financial institution has designed a platform that bridges digital and traditional assets. BNY’s initial focus is on using the power of blockchain and asset tokenization technology to drive operational efficiency, mobility of assets, transparency and real-time access to data.
BNY’s platform will integrate off-chain and on-chain data to streamline reporting, monitoring, and servicing capabilities across blockchains.
Last September, Bloomberg reported how BNY is moving closer to rolling out custody services for the bitcoin and ETH held in Exchange Traded Products or ETPs. At the time the SEC’s SAB 121 was still in place. The SAB 121 rule had forced banks to classify crypto as liabilities.
BNY has been developing digital assets custody services since before October 2022, but only now, with the SAB 121 rule removed, can financial institutions act for their clients.
BlackRock Chooses BNY’s New Blockchain Accounting Tool
Larry Fink was bullish about digital assets in his annual letter this week. He compared the SWIFT payment system to the postal service, and tokenization to how email has disrupted sending letters in the post.
“Every stock, every bond, every fund – every asset – can be tokenized. If they are. It will revolutionize investing.” Fink stated in the report. He is championing tokenization having watched the BlackRock Bitcoin ETP do so well since it was launched.
Shortly after Fink’s letter was made public, Fortune broke a story about BNY’s announcement of its latest crypto offering.
BNY’s new tool provides up-to-date data about a fund’s net asset value, directly on a blockchain. BNY’s Head of Digital Assets, Caroline Butler, told Fortune that “because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this.”
BlackRock is reported to be the first client for BNY’s new platform. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets confirmed the story in a statement to Fortune.
