- But don't let the negative sentiment stop you from buying stocks, some say.
- Four strategists share why the negative sentiment surrounding tariffs is overblown.
Thanks to the trade war, Americans are feeling downright awful about the economy. The latest University of Michigan consumer survey reported an 8% decline in sentiment from March, as consumers worried about inflation, unemployment, and their financial situation.
It's not only consumers — the American Association of Individual Investors recently reported the 12th consecutive week of a negative bull-bear spread, meaning that more investors were bearish than bullish on the stock market.
However, a growing cohort of market experts is shunning the doom-and-gloom narrative that the economy is on a collision course with recession. In their opinion, the bad vibes aren't quite aligning with reality. After all, corporate earnings are strong, the labor market is in good shape, and households have robust balance sheets.
Their advice? Don't let the negative news discourage you from buying into the stock market at a discount now. Often, overly bearish sentiment can be a contrarian indicator for a market rebound. Here's why these four strategists are keeping a cool head on tariffs and are ultimately optimistic about the market.
Alicia Levine, head of investment strategy and equities, BNY Wealth
To Levine, extremely low investor sentiment means that it's unlikely for markets to fall much further.
""Recession's on everybody's lips, and in some ways, that's a really good thing because, as you know, when the market is expecting something, the news of it itself is less likely to cause a downside whoosh,"" Levine told BI. ""The market has de-risked a lot of the downside scenarios.""
Ultimately, the stock market crash and negative sentiment are all self-inflicted by Trump, meaning that there's nothing wrong with the underlying economy, Levine said. On the bright side, any change in policy can also greatly reduce the chance of a recession.
Trump has shown himself amenable to negotiations, as he floated the idea of scaling back tariffs on China earlier this week. Levine believes that some sort of tariff deal will be struck before the 90-day tariff pause is up.
""There's some expectation that this is the peak of the tariffs, and so, as those move lower, that would seem to feed into the sense that there is right tail here,"" Levine said.
Tony DeSpirito, global CIO of fundamental equities and portfolio manager, BlackRock
DeSpirito, who oversees several income and value funds including the iShares Large Cap Value Active ETF (BLCV), has never been too concerned about Trump tariffs ruining the economy. Back in March, DeSpirito said on Bloomberg that it was a mistake for banks to be downgrading their stock market outlooks, and he's held steady to that view.
""Periods of uncertainty are actually great buying opportunities. Once the uncertainty abates, companies are very adaptive,"" DeSpirito told BI.
Right now, DeSpirito is seeing opportunities in healthcare services, medical devices, aerospace, and defense companies.
""In healthcare, I'm finding a lot more opportunity in services than I am in large-cap pharma. Large cap pharma has a lot of issues around where they locate their intellectual property,"" DeSpirito said. ""A number of them have large patent expirations that are upcoming.""
DeSpirito thinks the market is overly focused on the risk and overlooking opportunities down the road. He's confident that kinks in trade policy will be ironed out soon.
""In addition to greater certainty around trade, you'll also get deregulation, which will be a positive for the market and when you think about tariffs as a source of revenue, that revenue source will create more flexibility on the policy side,"" DeSpirito said.
Jonathan Curtis, chief investment officer, Franklin Equity Group
Tariff concerns have led many investors to diversify outside the US stock market, but Curtis believes the ""sell America"" narrative is overblown.
Instead of fleeing to international stocks, Curtis believes investors should be doubling down on US leaders like the Magnificent Seven. Especially now that many of the Big Tech names are down roughly 20% from all-time highs, Curtis sees a good opportunity for investors to add to their positions in high-quality companies for cheap.
""This productivity gain that we're going to get from artificial intelligence is going to be profound and those companies, many of them Mag 7, hold the keys to that,"" Curtis said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22.
Curtis is also bullish on defensive sectors like healthcare, where demand for treatments will remain constant no matter what part of the economic cycle we're in. He sees innovations in GLP-1 medications and AI driving sustained future growth for the healthcare sector.
""Those businesses are as good as they were over the long term prior to Inauguration Day, and those companies are incredibly well-positioned for what's about to come,"" Curtis said of the Magnificent Seven.
Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy, ClearBridge Investments
It's easy to buy into a doomsday recession narrative, but Schulze doesn't see much evidence to back it up. There's been a lot of talk about how consumer sentiment is at historic lows, but actions are more important than sentiment itself, he said.
""In this cycle in particular, it's more important to watch what people do rather than what they say, because when you look at the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, it's been low and declining, yet consumption has been fairly broad-based over the last couple of years,"" Schulze said at a Franklin Templeton conference on April 22.
US consumers might not feel so optimistic, but numbers show they're in great shape. Household debt levels are low, and many homeowners locked in low mortgage rates, insulating them from their biggest monthly expense, according to Schulze.
""This is a great opportunity to be dollar-cost averaging into the weakness that we've seen,"" Schulze said. ""A lot of negativity has been priced in a short period of time for US equities, and I don't see any structural excesses in the economy that would cause a deep recession."""

The solution will also produce early warning signals that flag potential credit deterioration, macro-adjusted PDs incorporating both climate and economic factors, and loss given defaults at the facility level.

House Republicans Draft Cuts to Federal Employee Pensions
The changes would cause many government workers to contribute more, while receiving reduced benefits.
Federal employees’ pensions could undergo several changes that would gradually reduce their benefits, as part of a Republican federal budget resolution working its way through Congress.
Representative James Comer, R-Kentucky, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has offered proposals that would change how federal civilian employees’ benefits are calculated, which would make them pay more into the system while receiving reduced benefits, according to an April 25 release.
“The House Oversight Committee is taking a critical step to advance President [Donald] Trump’s America First agenda and ensure taxpayer dollars are used effectively, efficiently, and responsibly,” Comer said in a statement. “The Committee will consider legislation that delivers a substantial win for fiscal responsibility, achieving a reduction in the federal deficit of over $50 billion dollars.”
The committee is set to consider the legislation on Wednesday, April 30.
The proposal would raise federal and postal employees’ contribution rates to 4.4%, which the release estimated would raise $30.7 billion for the deficit reduction. The current contribution rates are based on each employee’s date of hire, as follows: 0.8% if hired in or before 2012; 3.1% if hired in 2013; and 4.4% if hired in or since 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The Federal Employees Retirement System is the retirement system for federal civilian employees. It provides benefits from three different sources: a Basic Benefit Plan, Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan. In fiscal 2022, more than 2.7 million people received federal civil service annuity payments; 56% received annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (which covers federal employees hired before 1984), and 44% received annuities under FERS, according to information from FERS and the Congressional Research Service.
For new federal retirees, the proposal would eliminate the extra retirement annuity payment currently provided to those who retire before age 62, lasting until they reach their Social Security retirement age and saving $10.1 billion, according to the release.
Federal pension benefits would also be reduced by basing retirees’ benefits on the highest average five years of salary, compared with the current standard of the highest average three years of salary, which would save $4.75 billion, according to the release.
Other changes include offering federal employees the option to “serve at will” to receive higher take-home pay, which would save $4.54 billion.
The proposals come as Republicans develop their larger federal budget resolution, which House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, has previously said he would like to finalize as early as May.
The House GOP has a goal of finding at least $2 trillion in savings to partially offset the cost of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, as well as adding new cuts to taxes on overtime and tips. The Senate, in its version of the budget plan, has given itself leeway to make as little as $4 billion in cuts."

Pune among fastest-growing job markets, sees 39% YoY increase
While Bengaluru and Hyderabad continue to dominate hiring, Pune has emerged as a fastest-growing job market, registering 7% month-on-month growth and 39% year-on-year growth, according to foundit Insights Tracker (previously known as Monster Employment Index) for February 2025.
Pune: A thriving tech ecosystem, rising presence of global capability centres (GCCs) and rich pool of students have made the city one of the fastest-growing job markets in the country.
While Bengaluru and Hyderabad continue to dominate hiring, Pune has emerged as a fastest-growing job market, registering 7% month-on-month growth and 39% year-on-year growth, according to foundit Insights Tracker (previously known as Monster Employment Index) for February 2025.
""With a 70% surge in GCCs - from 210+ in 2019 to 360+ in 2024 - the city has evolved into a strategic hub for global enterprises, driven by high-value, innovation-led work,"" said Karthik Padmanabhan, managing partner - GCC Business, Zinnov, a global management and strategy consultancy firm. The city continues to attract global players like Dassault Systemes, Tenerity, DataAxle even as BNY Mellon and American Express expand their footprints.
""Pune has emerged as one of the strongest hiring hubs, keeping pace with major metros like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. Its steady job market growth reflects sustained demand across industries, particularly in manufacturing, IT, healthcare, and BFSI. Pune's expansion has been more balanced, with both short-term and long-term hiring trends showing resilience,"" said V Suresh, CEO, foundit. Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital, said the hiring momentum remained high in the city, with companies actively recruiting software developers, AI specialists, and cyber security experts. ""Pune's tech job market is a key driver of growth in India, strengthening its position as a major hub for technology hiring. It ranks among our top four cities for business, and we expect around 10% year-on-year growth from this region,"" she said.
The reason why the city is emerging as a fastest-growing job market is because it offers a strong talent pool and lower cost compared to tier-1 cities. According to the latest LinkedIn Jobs on the Rise in Pune (2025), a data-backed ranking of the 10 fastest-growing jobs over the past three years - jobs like strategy manager, AI engineer, travel consultant, psychologist, and sales development representative were among the top fastest-growing jobs.
""With Pune emerging as a preferred destination for global innovation centres and deep-tech startups, demand for skills in AI, cloud computing, and automation is also surging,"" said Yeshab Giri, chief commercial officer, professional talent solutions, Randstad India, a talent company.
