- BNY is calling employees back to the office four days a week starting in September, the bank said in a Wednesday memo seen by Reuters.
- The New York-based bank, which has required employees to spend three days a week in office since the first half of 2023, is instituting the change beginning Sept. 2. BNY managers have been in-office four days per week since January.
- The bank, which has 51,000 employees, will continue to allow remote work one day a week, the memo said. “We have no plans to return to 5 days in office unless circumstances were to demand otherwise.” A spokesperson declined to comment but confirmed what Reuters reported.
Dive Insight:
BNY is the latest Wall Street bank seeking to pull workers back to the office more frequently, five years since the COVID-19 pandemic prompted widespread remote work.
In January, JPMorgan Chase joined Goldman Sachs in requiring workers to return to the office five days per week beginning in March, which drew complaints. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been among the biggest proponents of in-office work, saying in 2023 “there’s nothing like face-to-face.”
Last year, Citi, U.S. Bank, Truist, Deutsche Bank and Barclays were among those that upped the number of days employees needed to be in office. Most CEOs expect a full return to in-office work by 2027, according to KPMG.
“Being in the office together helps us collaborate and move work forward more efficiently. Occasional remote work can be effective, but in person we can respond more quickly to dynamic, fast-paced financial markets and better serve our clients,” BNY said in the memo to employees, noting it’s seen “positive momentum” from most managers being in office four days a week.
The bank will also continue offering employees two weeks of “work from anywhere” per year."

- The news comes as banks across Wall Street pull bankers back to the office full time.
- Business Insider obtained the memo, which said the bank has no plans for fully in-office work.
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., known for helping financial clients clear and custody securities, is the latest bank to rein in remote work. In a memo to staff, the firm's executive committee announced that it was asking employees to return to the office four days a week.
The memo, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said the new requirement would take place starting September 2, 2025, the day after Labor Day. The firm, commonly known as BNY, has required its workers to be in the office three days a week since 2023. Managers were called back to the office four days a week earlier this year.
The switch comes as companies from Amazon to AT&T start asking workers to return to pre-pandemic norms. Similar efforts are unfolding across Wall Street: JPMorgan Chase called its workers back to the office five days a week earlier this year, prompting some workers to explore unionization efforts or look for new jobs.
The memo from BNY's executive committee focuses on the importance of community and culture, which requires that employees spend more time together in the office.
It also emphasized the importance of ""personal flexibility.""
Indeed, BNY told its 51,000-plus employees it has ""no plans"" to require five days a week. It said employees will also continue to have the flexibility to work two weeks a year from anywhere, a perk the bank has dubbed ""work from anywhere.""
The bank, which also offers wealth management and investment advice, had previously instituted a 2-week ""recharge period"" around the end of each year, which allows employees to work remotely and skip non-essential activities, like internal meetings.
See the memo below:
As we continue to place even more emphasis on our community and culture, we believe that it is important that all of us spend more time together working, leading and learning from each other. As a result, we have decided that it is appropriate to ask all employees* to return to the office 4 days a week by September 2, 2025.
As a leadership team, we're committed to maintaining personal flexibility, and will continue to support remote work one day a week. We have no plans to return to 5 days in office unless circumstances were to demand otherwise.
We also want to remind everyone that we provide a ""work from anywhere"" benefit and a range of other benefits to help colleagues care for their mental and physical health and wellbeing.
This step is also facilitated by the continued investments our firm is making in our offices and workspaces to deliver a modern, world-class in-office experience to our employees.
Being in the office together helps us collaborate and move work forward more efficiently. Occasional remote work can be effective, but in person we can respond more quickly to dynamic, fast-paced financial markets and better serve our clients. Most managers are already in the office 4 days a week, and we have seen the positive momentum this creates.
While we expect all employees to return to the office 4 days a week by September 2 at the latest, our offices are already open to you to come in as frequently as you'd like.
One BNY is more than an idea or a concept — it's a culture, and culture is made up of people. Which means all of us. Thank you for your commitment to our clients, our company and our community, and to this next step on our journey to Thrive Together.
The Executive Committee"

BlackRock will work with BNY Mellon in creating a new class of Distributed Ledger Technology shares for the fund.
What to know:
- BlackRock is introducing a digital share class for its $150 billion Treasury Trust fund, utilizing blockchain technology through BNY Mellon.
- The new shares will use blockchain to mirror share ownership records, potentially leading to broader adoption of digital assets.
- BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has highlighted the potential of tokenization and warned the U.S. could lose financial dominance if it fails to manage its debt.
BlackRock partnered with BNY Mellon to bring blockchain to the back office of one of its largest funds, filing to offer a digital share class of its $150 billion Treasury Trust money market fund through BNY Mellon.
The new “DLT Shares,” short for distributed ledger technology, won’t hold crypto. BNY Mellon, the fund’s exclusive distributor, intends to use blockchain to mirror share ownership records, an incremental step that could pave the way for broader adoption of tokenized cash, digital assets, or blockchain-based settlement infrastructure in traditional finance.
In the past few years, a growing number of firms have experimented with creating blockchain-based representations of real-world assets (RWAs), bringing the traditional finance world rapidly into the crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi) environment. Earlier Wednesday, Libre said it was tokenizing $500 million of messaging platform Telegram's $2.4 billion debt and bringing it to the TON blockchain.
BlackRock's Liquidity Treasury Trust Fund is part of the firm’s Liquidity Funds suite and managed over $150 billion in assets as of April 29. The DLT share class has a minimum investment requirement of $3 million for institutional buyers, with no minimums on subsequent purchases. The SEC filing is preliminary and subject to approval.
The move isn’t BlackRock’s first into tokenization. Its blockchain-native BUIDL fund, created in partnership with Securitize, now manages over $1.7 billion in assets and recently expanded onto Solana.
CEO Larry Fink has consistently emphasized his belief in the long-term potential of tokenization and decentralized finance. In his 2025 annual letter to shareholders, Fink warned that the U.S. risks ceding its financial dominance if it fails to control its debt, a vulnerability that could accelerate investor interest in alternatives like bitcoin
“If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control … America risks losing [its reserve currency status] to digital assets like Bitcoin,” Fink wrote. “Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage.”
UPDATE (March 1, 17:20 UTC): Rewrites, lead headline to clarify that BNY and BlackRock are partnering to bring the fund onchain.
UPDATE (April 30, 7:29 UTC): Adds third paragraph on tokenization trends, rewrites headline.

KuCoin Hits Record Market Share as 2025 Volumes Outpace Crypto Market
KuCoin captured a record share of centralised exchange volume in 2025, with more than $1.25tn traded as its volumes grew faster than the wider crypto market.
What to know:
- KuCoin recorded over $1.25 trillion in total trading volume in 2025, equivalent to an average of roughly $114 billion per month, marking its strongest year on record.
- This performance translated into an all-time high share of centralised exchange volume, as KuCoin’s activity expanded faster than aggregate CEX volumes, which slowed during periods of lower market volatility.
- Spot and derivatives volumes were evenly split, each exceeding $500 billion for the year, signalling broad-based usage rather than reliance on a single product line.
- Altcoins accounted for the majority of trading activity, reinforcing KuCoin’s role as a primary liquidity venue beyond BTC and ETH at a time when majors saw more muted turnover.
- Even as overall crypto volumes softened mid-year, KuCoin maintained elevated baseline activity, indicating structurally higher user engagement rather than short-lived volume spikes.

As a result, innovative operational enhancements and responsive risk management are more critical than ever for credit managers to adequately navigate this rapidly changing environment and support growth.
The merging of public and private markets is well-documented, with the private credit market experiencing extraordinary growth in recent years. According to a recent report by Percent, the private credit market is now worth about $2 trillion,1 nearly equaling the size of the broadly syndicated loan market. This evolution brings new opportunities for borrowers and investors alike.
Barring any impact by market volatility, growth of the private credit market is projected to hit $3.5 trillion globally by 2028,2 driving more managers to enter the private credit market to meet investor demand and capitalize on the opportunity. In doing so, they are offering loans in different fund wrappers, with the market now expanding beyond the traditional closed end draw down funds to include products such as exchanged traded funds (ETFs) and interval funds. Managers are also having to adapt to unfamiliar processes and integrate new order management capabilities into their systems as they seek to support shifting demands. For instance, private market managers are increasingly venturing into the broadly syndicated loans space, while many public managers traditionally focused on the syndicated space are developing private market capabilities. This involves building and maintaining lending networks to enable loan origination — a significant change from public managers' usual practices.
With private credit on the rise in the CLO and credit fund space — and with new CLO issuance reaching an all-time high of $191 billion as of November 20243 — to effectively compete, managers but equip themselves with tools to help clients capitalize on the transforming landscape, while also driving operational efficiency and remaining profitable.
The Challenges: unstructured data, operational inefficiencies
Unstructured data and how loan data is communicated are among the most pressing issues for the industry. Data ingestion — the intake, processing and normalization of the data for use — is critical to operational excellence in credit and loan administration. The bespoke nature of the traditional syndicated loans market, where credit agreement terms and conditions can be tailored to borrower and lender needs, offers flexibility but also presents challenges to standardizing how the data is ingested and ultimately consumed. While efforts are underway to achieve standardization of data for greater efficiency, the growing presence of private credit to the market, however, with its smaller lending groups and bespoke processes and communication methods, has added complexity. EY’s Global Alternatives Fund Survey indicates that data management and integration are significant concerns for alternative fund managers, with more than half of the those surveyed facing issues with real-time data or integration across functions4.
The lack of standardization in data messaging formats and fields across industry tools and platforms leads to inconsistent data being communicated between transactions, making it difficult for managers to make well-informed decisions about asset performance.
The way data is communicated is also not standard across the industry, with various channels and interaction models between borrowers and their treasury desks. This can result in a substantial amount of daily work for multiple parties to check each other's numbers, come to an agreement and produce reports upon which investment decisions can be made.
Another obstacle for managers is the heavy reliance on manual processes for reconciliation and settlement that are inherent in the over-the-counter loan market. Unlike other investment instruments, where settlement occurs electronically via exchanges, the loan market involves trading over-the-counter. End-to-end operations and reconciliation still rely heavily on manual, legacy processes, which can lead to operational inefficiencies, risks, input errors, data breaks and added costs. Loan settlement typically takes ten to 25 days, and manual processing can be particularly challenging during high-volume reporting periods. Coupled with the challenge of non-standardized data ingestion, the demand for private credit has increased the manual effort required by all parties.
Emerging trends for more effective data management
Given the importance of effective data ingestion as the foundation of any successful CLO or credit fund operational model, industry players are actively working to create more structured data and messaging. Automation, supported by advanced technology is already making a significant impact on performing more frequent data reconciliation, but more development is needed, in addition to standardization of data, for mainstream adoption.
Absent material standardization in the loan market to date, managers’ frequent and thorough reconciliation with loan and fund administration partners is crucial for operational efficiency. Regular reconciliation helps address issues and exceptions by maintaining consistent alignment and enabling discrepancies to be corrected immediately, rather than waiting until critical reporting dates. Early and frequent reconciliation can also lead to a smoother reporting process and potentially reduce pressure on managers and loan administration providers during report cycles.
Many firms are also looking to service providers for access to advanced technologies that can help streamline workflows, standardize operations and help enable managers to scale. In fact, 69% of respondents to the EY Alternative Fund Survey stated operational efficiency as the top driver of their technology investment.5
The industry is also adopting more structured consumption mechanisms within their facility set-up processes. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is being utilized to electronically “read” PDF documents — capturing, interpreting and processing relevant asset characteristics automatically. In addition, there is a growing movement around the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models to enhance the flexibility of document consumption tools, enabling them to extract more critical information with less training over time.
AI and machine learning can also add considerable value by performing ongoing data quality checks, identifying and addressing common errors and enhancing straight-through processing. These technologies can help managers overcome challenges posed by the loan market's unstructured, memo-based nature and the use of legacy platforms.
Alongside AI, there is an opportunity for the industry to better leverage existing technologies, guided by human intelligence, to establish frameworks for exception-based tasks. This approach helps identify what can be consumed automatically and what requires manual processing. By focusing on these guardrails, attention can be directed specifically to where human intervention is needed, rather than on each transaction.
Transparency and confidence
To enhance transparency for clients across many aspects of the CLO lifecycle, leading service providers are investing in tools to increase managers’ visibility into the administration cycle and help ensure correct information is accessible on-demand as well as disseminated at scheduled reporting periods. This alone can be a game changer as managers deal with multiple structures and communicate with various third parties — ranging from clients to regulators and other industry participants.
To ensure smooth and efficient functioning, integration and interoperability of different data layers are essential. Technology solutions that can consume disparate data sources, standardize them and present them for consumption in a fit-for-purpose way across personas and use cases are vital for managers to navigate the evolving market. For instance, some data management platforms can ingest data from multiple
third parties — such as market data providers and servicing vendors — to offer complete oversight of transactional data, reference data and other types of data through a centralized repository. Acting as an outsourced data engine across a client’s entire book of business, reports can be built and ingested into the client’s own systems, ensuring seamless integration.
Managers need complete transparency into holdings, data breaks and documents to make informed investment decisions and meet regulatory requirements. But improved transparency goes beyond regulatory compliance; it can also enhance the reliability of data as a valuable asset for managers. With more trust in data quality, managers can make assessments with greater confidence, reducing the need for frequent double-checking and reevaluation. This improved data confidence is particularly important as the market appears poised for further growth.
Service providers can deliver significant value by supplying accurate, timley and integrated data, empowering managers to better meet their reporting obligations, reduce risks, improve overall perfomance and capitalize on growing market opportunities.
Beyond the back office: optimizing across the credit lifecycle
Moving beyond back-office operations, there are several other areas that present opportunities for managers to strengthen operating models, gain efficiencies and differentiate themselves in the market. Liquidity management and financing are two areas in which this can be applied. To effectively manage liquidity, managers should have access to a timely and comprehensive view of all investment operations data. The market demand for centralizing liquidity and financing activities within a single ecosystem creates efficiencies and scalability, allowing more flexibility to consider a broader pool of asset types to use as collateral. Integration with custody and payments offers a stable balance sheet for deposits and immediate proceeds upon redemption, while real-time trade confirmations and reports allow for instantaneous updates and views into position changes. In turn, this helps to maximize liquidity, manage risks and improve performance.
Additionally, middle office solutions such as performance, attribution, and risk services — especially when integrated with fund and loan administration offerings — can enable better decision-making and risk mitigation, along with fulfillment of investor and regulatory reporting requirements. Benefitting from a unified view of investment data, managers can more easily monitor fund activity, understand the impact of investment decisions and identify and execute on growth opportunities.
With the growing demand for credit products and fierce manager competition, distribution is a crucial area to focus on. By connecting with wealth advisors who are seeking credit products, managers can strengthen their distribution efforts and reach a broader audience of investors looking for new ways to diversify their portfolios and generate alpha. Service providers who offer comprehensive solutions can be valuable allies in this area, offering connections and introductions that can help drive distribution and growth.
Identifying the right service provider
The right service provider can be transformational for credit managers looking to achieve operational excellence and competitive differentiation. Domain expertise, scale, resiliency and flexible technology are all critical factors to consider when evaluating potential partners.
Specialized expertise in the credit space is an important factor for credit managers. A provider that genuinely grasps the nuances of the credit asset class can deliver valuable insights and consultation to help managers navigate the rapidly evolving market and evaluate opportunities to optimize operations through specialized services and technology. Providers should be set up to adapt to rapidly changing consumption models and be flexible enough to fit managers' evolving needs.
Achieving operating model scalability is identified as one of the industry’s top strategic priorities6. As the market grows, so will the volume and complexity of data that managers need to handle. This underscores the importance of choosing a provider that offers scalable, resilient technology, ensuring managers can effectively consume data and use it to seize opportunities as they emerge.
While leading-edge technology is important, it is essential to look for providers that have clearly articulated roadmaps for advancing their products — simplifying work and driving client success. A service provider that invests in the latest technology, coupled with a strong and agile product management discipline, can provide managers with fit-for-purpose tools to support their current and future needs. This includes tools for data ingestion, processing efficiency, accurate and timely data reporting and regulatory compliance. Some providers are already delivering increased automation, straight-through-processing, exception-based task and escalation workflows, systematic integration via APIs and cloud data-sharing, greater transparency via online dashboards and overall improved client experiences.
Ideally, the right service provider should act as an extension of their client's shop, providing seamless technology integration and well-honed operational workflows. This collaboration can lead to increased efficiency, cost savings and better decision-making across various stages of the credit lifecycle.
When evaluating a service provider, credit managers would be well served to ask the following essential questions:
1. How do you support the entire operational workflow, from data ingestion to processing and reporting?
2. What measures do you take to ensure data quality, accuracy and standardization to support decision-making and regulatory compliance?
3. How do you facilitate technology integration, streamline workflows and communications, and automate manual processes to enhance processing efficiency?
4. What are you doing to ensure transparency in reporting, including timely and accurate data reporting and complete transparency into holdings, breaks and documents?
5. Beyond operational support, what other products or services do you offer that could help enhance the management of our credit book?
By collaborating with a tenured service provider that offers specialized expertise, investments in technology and streamlined processes, credit managers can achieve operational excellence in credit management and enter a phase of growth where resources can be reallocated to focus on decision-making to stay ahead in an ever-evolving market. The right service provider can help managers turn data into an asset, increase efficiency, and improve the overall client experience.

BNY spent the week engaging with clients and policymakers and came away believing that businesses and governments are settling in for a longer period of heightened uncertainty. Within an evolving geopolitical, economic and market environment, three key themes were consistent across our conversations.
1. The Pursuit of Growth is Universal, but Increasingly Regional
At the beginning of the year, our experts wrote about the megatrends driving the growth outlook and how each are changing economies, both advanced and emerging. The world has shifted significantly since, but across jurisdictions the focus remains on pursuing policies that boost growth. That pursuit is taking place within the context of changes in trade routes, monetary and fiscal policies, regulatory approaches, industrial support and the impact of AI and blockchain.
In response, public and private sector leaders are looking to boost domestic sources of growth while reshoring, or “friendshoring,” industries to protect against an uncertain global landscape. In the first four months of the year, home bias is apparent. Japanese investors are buying JGBs over U.S. Bonds. EU investors are buying German Bunds. The consequence of increased volatility since March has shifted risk and reward ratios making EUR and JPY compete with the USD as safe havens. U.S. asset selling has been notable since the start of the year and doesn’t look done yet, despite the relief rally in bonds and stocks in April. We expect more regionalization moving forward, but we also expect global investment flows to remain an important component of the growth story.
2. Adaptability Matters
For countries and businesses large and small, navigating this evolving landscape will require adaptability. What came through in our conversations last week was the importance of dynamic budgeting, scenario planning and risk management. During periods of heightened uncertainty and volatility, it is critical to be prepared for all outcomes, particularly as global economic and geopolitical shocks become more of the norm and less so outlier events.
On the global stage, some countries have already quickly recognized their new reality and moved to secure opportunities that elevate their own geopolitical standing, boost economic growth and drive prosperity.
Business leaders face similar risk and reward moments, particularly as innovative technologies — such as AI and blockchain — look to fundamentally change how we live and work. Positioning a business — its balance sheet, operational structure and global footprint and its employees — to remain flexible and adjust quickly to evolving geopolitical, economic and market developments is now table stakes. Failing to do so will leave businesses caught flat-footed and unable to meet their growth potential.
3. 'Opting Out' is Not an Option
Operating in this new environment also means that “opting out” of change is not an option. Every day at BNY, we see our clients around the world who are increasingly adopting pragmatism, new operating models and partnerships with each other. They are doing this to increase their own resilience, to scale and to achieve profitability in the world as it exists now, not the way they wish it to be.
That sentiment has now permeated the public sector. Across our conversations last week, officials recognize that maintaining the status quo is impossible. Change is necessary, expected by their constituencies and needs to move at pace. A good case study is what has transpired in Europe over the first four months of this year: simplifying regulation, boosting market connectivity and driving further investment into economies. Many of these changes will take time to materialize in the data, but we see the appetite for change having a durable impact on business and the public sector for the foreseeable future."

This strategic move highlights BNY’s commitment to enhancing its operations in the Middle East, according to a statement.
The RHQ located in Riyadh will deliver strategic, administrative, and corporate services for BNY throughout the Middle East. BNY’s existing Asset Servicing solutions available for clients in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia include Global Custody Services, Global Risk Solutions, Custody FX, and Institutional Accounting under a Capital Markets Authority license.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is delivering on its Vision 2030, and we will continue to bring BNY’s expertise across the financial lifecycle to help the KSA achieve its ambitions,” said Hani Kablawi, head of International at BNY. “Today’s announcement underscores the strategic importance of the Middle East in BNY’s international growth plans and our commitment to being an enduring partner to our clients across the region.”
Saudi Arabia’s incentives for foreign firms
Riyadh has been actively aiming to attract more companies to establish their regional headquarters in the kingdom by offering tax breaks, as Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman seeks to diversify the economy away from oil by drawing in foreign investment.
Saudi Arabia’s new rules stipulate that foreign firms must have regional headquarters in the kingdom in order to access lucrative government contracts. In May 2024, Goldman Sachs received a license to set up its regional headquarters in Riyadh, while U.S. lender Citigroup secured a similar approval late last year.
Middle East: A growing market for global banks
The Middle East has emerged as a vital growth market for global banks like BNY, propelled by a surge in sovereign wealth fund activity, substantial infrastructure investments, and the expansion of capital markets across the Gulf. As regional economies diversify away from oil and attract foreign capital through reforms and regulatory enhancements, international financial institutions are increasing their presence to seize new business opportunities in asset servicing, custody, and advisory.
The new regional headquarters in Riyadh will provide strategic, administrative, and corporate support for BNY’s operations across the Middle East, according to the custodian bank.
BNY has a decades-long history of working with clients in Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman, providing access to global markets, developing local market infrastructure capabilities, and supporting the growth of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s capital markets landscape."

Ethereum’s BlackRock deal is creating quite a stir right now in financial circles as the world’s largest asset manager takes a bold step into blockchain territory. Just a few days ago, on April 28, BlackRock went ahead and filed with the SEC to tokenize its massive $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund, creating what they’re calling “DLT Shares.” This move, at the time of writing, represents the largest real-world asset flow to Ethereum yet and could change how big institutions approach cryptocurrency and blockchain technology in general.

BlackRock’s Treasury Trust Tokenization
The Ethereum-BlackRock deal basically involves tracking ownership of BlackRock’s Treasury Trust Fund through blockchain technology with BNY Mellon handling the records. This particular fund mainly invests in short-term US Treasury securities to provide those stable returns that investors are looking for.

BlackRock filed to tokenize its $150bn Treasury Trust money-market fund with a new “DLT Shares” class.
BNY Mellon will keep a blockchain mirror of every share on-chain.
Biggest real-world asset flow to Ethereum yet.
BlackRock also previously launched their BUIDL fund on Ethereum, which right now manages around $2.34 billion in assets. This new Ethereum-BlackRock deal kind of builds on their existing experience with institutional blockchain adoption.
Ethereum’s Position as Industry Standard
Ethereum currently has a pretty strong dominance in real-world asset tokenization with about 56% market share and approximately $6.2 billion in tokenized assets. This deal really reinforces this position even further.
Onchain Foundation head of research Leon Waidmann said:
“Institutions follow deep liquidity, credible neutrality, and battle-tested security. ETH is already their settlement layer.”
The Ethereum tokenization process seems to be becoming more and more attractive to major financial institutions that are looking for better efficiency and transparency in their operations.

BlackRock’s Vision for Blockchain Finance
BlackRock’s crypto investment strategy appears to be accelerating quite a bit lately. The firm’s leadership has made some pretty clear statements about their support for blockchain technology and its potential.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said:
“Tokenization will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.”
This Ethereum-BlackRock deal represents a significant step toward this vision of transformed financial markets with faster settlement times and more efficient capital use.
ETH Price Performance Despite Institutional Interest
Even with all the excitement around the Ethereum-BlackRock deal, ETH prices are still kind of subdued, hovering around $1,800 and down about 63% from those 2021 peaks we saw. The Ethereum market volatility continues to be a factor despite these positive institutional developments we’re seeing.
Interestingly enough, BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF has still accumulated approximately $162 million worth of Ether over just four trading days, which shows some institutional confidence despite the current Ethereum market volatility that we’re experiencing.

BlackRock Advances Toward Blockchain for Money Market Fund Shares
BlackRock has filed to issue digital shares for one of its well-known money market funds. These shares are anticipated to reflect the performance of the BlackRock Liquidity Funds Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX). They will employ blockchain to provide an additional level of transparency regarding the ownership of the shares.
The news, in an SEC filing published today, could signal a significant shift from traditional asset management models regarding the use of blockchain in financial services. The shares themselves won’t be tokenized, but blockchain will be employed to mirror ownership records in the interest of verification, giving investors a transparent way to verify ownership.
How BlackRock Works to Use Blockchain in Its Digital Shares
The digital shares will be backed by BlackRock’s Treasury Fund, primarily investing in U.S. Treasury bills and cash, worth over $150 million. The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) will use blockchain technology to maintain a “mirror record” of share ownership. The blockchain will maintain an updated ledger of share ownership for verification purposes, but it won’t function as the primary, legally binding ownership record.
Institutional Investment Requirements for BlackRock’s DLT Shares
The barrier to entry for institutional investors seeking to purchase these digital shares is enormous. The DLT shares can only be acquired with a minimum of $3m and the trades will only be done on transactions that pass through BNY Mellon. The exclusivity underscores the product’s strategic, large-scale focus, targeting institutional investors rather than retail ones.
Although the filing doesn’t peg details on a ticker or management fee for the digital shares, the filing foregrounds the potential for blockchain to further leak into mainstream aspects of finance. The filing is aligned with similar moves by other large finance industry players, like Fidelity, which recently filed for an Ethereum-based share class that could represent their own U.S. Treasury fund.
BlackRock and the Growing Market for Treasury Tokenization
Filing as a longer-term trend in finance: experimentation with blockchain to allow tokenized versions of things like treasury bills and other traditional financial instruments. Already, the treasury tokenization market is more than $6 billion in value, with BlackRock’s BUIDL boasting more than $2.55 billion in assets.
The Regulatory Setting and Its Potential Impact on BlackRock and the Industry
The BlackRock filing comes on the heels of a similar effort by Fidelity, which recently filed for an Ethereum-based OnChain share class. Though Fidelity’s filing remains subject to a regulator’s blessing, the interest in blockchain and financial service is clear. If these filings are granted, it could be an indication that blockchain is being increasingly embraced at traditional financial markets.
The BlackRock’s shift is also a product of the company’s strategic place in a shifting market. BlackRock, with more than $8 trillion in assets under management, has the clout and capacity to push for a shift in how financial products are designed and sold. If this works, these digital shares could replace much of the opacity and overhead in the asset management world.
