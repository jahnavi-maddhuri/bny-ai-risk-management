EXHIBIT #1: CROSS-BORDER SELLING OF USTS SINCE APRIL 2
Source:BNY Markets, iFlow
Our iFlow data confirms that cross-border investors are exiting U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets. Last week, our U.S. Treasury flow registered its third largest outflow by foreign-based investors since the early days of the pandemic. As Exhibit #1 shows, cross-border outflows from USTs have been almost entirely across the yield curve, with only the very long (10y and higher) segment seeing inflows from abroad.
The sharp sell-off in bond yields, with the 10y note pushing up to 5.7% intraday at the end of last week, has keyed speculation in the markets of foreign shedding of USD-based assets and musings about “de-dollarization”, or the beginning of the end of the USD as a global reserve currency. Even with the DXY U.S. dollar index moving below 100, we think that discussion is premature from a long-term structural economic perspective. There is no doubt that U.S. assets, including Treasuries, are seeing increased selling pressure.
Exhibit #1 shows average daily flows (on a scored basis) for different yield buckets on the curve and cash and short-term instruments (“CAST”) since April 3, the first day after the administration announced sweep universal and retaliatory tariffs. While the selling – save for the very long end – has been unequivocal, it is hardly a recent development.
EXHIBIT #2: FLOWS WEAKER SINCE BEGINNING OF YEAR
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Exhibit #2 shows cumulative cross-border flows into (or out of) USTs over the past twelve months, starting on April 12, 2024. We accumulate overseas flows every day, allowing us to see the ebbs and flows of foreign demand. In mid-2024, after the resolution of the debt ceiling crisis, we see a large jump in foreign inflows into USTs, primarily due to a slew of T-bill issuance that occurred upon the debt ceiling’s resolution. From that point on, save for a few brief and discernable episodes – like October 2024 and late December last year- foreign demand has been tepid at best. By the end of 2024 and early 2025, we have observed persistent and sustained selling by foreign domiciled real money investors, reaccelerating after early April 2025.
EXHIBIT #3: EXITING US FIXED INCOME
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
We have seen evidence of foreign selling across other USD assets as well. In U.S. equities, selling by cross-border investors has been persistent since late 2024. Across non-UST fixed income assets, we see selling in MBS securities, munis, and corporate bonds over the past 5 days. This shedding of USD-denominated assets is broad based, as seen in Exhibit #3.
Forward look
Foreign investors exiting USD denominated assets, especially in fixed income, has been a feature of post-election U.S. markets. However, since April 2, it has accelerated and become broad-based, which we don’t think is a short-lived phenomenon. While U.S. economic policy uncertainty remains at historically high levels and U.S. asset volatility is similarly elevated, investors remain skittish. Additionally, the Federal Reserve argues that rates are on hold until clear signs of weakness in U.S. growth data emerge."

Data has become the lifeblood of wealth management firms, but managing it effectively poses numerous challenges. From data silos to disconnected technology, firms can struggle to find an enterprise view. And, if data isn’t harmonized across the organization, it’s hard to use for gleaning insights, growing businesses, and adapting to the fast-changing and demanding financial market.
Many wealth management firms have turned to the cloud for data management, but shifting data, pipelines and operations to the cloud is not a magic bullet. Firms also must have both a clear strategy and robust framework for maintaining the accessibility, catalogue, quality, and governance of their data. A secure data share can help an enterprise uphold these four pillars of cloud data management.
What Is a Data Share?
As its name suggests, a data share is a tool in a data consumption solution that shares data from one cloud-based account with other cloud-based accounts. More technically, a share is a package of data offerings on a cloud account that other data consumers can subscribe to. In addition, shared database objects are immutable, as they are read-only and cannot be altered.
BNY and Snowflake: A Powerful Data Share Team
The flexibility of a Snowflake share enables consumers to enhance their data sets, and they can then share data back with the provider1. With the data located in one place, consumers know where to find data, when they need it. Moreover, a unique differentiator of Snowflake is that there is no file transfer, which means data is immediately available for reading.
Clients without a Snowflake account can participate in a data share via an authentication process that links the client’s chosen cloud account to BNY’s Snowflake instance. In either circumstance, the near-instantaneous access to high-quality data offers firms the tools to collaborate, innovate, and grow.
Accessibility: The Key to Collaboration
Access to data is necessary for any aspect of wealth management—be it estate planning, investment management, business succession, and more. When teams across the enterprise can access data across the firm, they can collaborate more easily, which in turn enables them to:
- Solve business challenges to improve performance and outcomes.
- Drive innovation to create new products, services, and business models.
- Enhance differentiation to gain an edge over competitors.
With a cloud data share, data is accessible in near real time. In BNY’s Snowflake data share, BNY aggregates data from multiple sources and then makes it accessible to the consumer via either a subscription or authentication process. This way, data consumers within BNY and data consumers who are clients of BNY can easily access the data they need. In addition, since cloud updates are nearly instantaneous, consumers can be sure they are working with the latest information.
Catalogue: Benefiting from a Data Superset
Nevertheless, access to data is not enough. Consumers must also be able to find the right data at the right time. A data share offers a centralized, easy-to-use data catalogue. The distinct data marts in a share are large databases organized around a unifying principle. Just as a library has different sections (e.g., Fiction, Young Adult, Nature), a data share provider offers various data marts (e.g., Accounts, Transactions, Market Value). Within each share that consumers subscribe to, data is documented and organized.
For instance, one firm might only subscribe to streaming custody data, but another may subscribe to both streaming data and the derived data that provides performance information. Regardless of their subscription details, both firms can:
- Scan and index data sources across platforms and environments
- Identify the gaps and overlaps in their data landscape
- Optimize data storage and performance
The result is a wealth management data superset fit for purpose. Data consumers know what data assets they have, where they are, how they’re structured, and who owns them.
Quality: Confidence Behind Innovation
Knowing where and how to find data is great, but data integrity and quality are also critical to addressing business needs. On the one hand, a share mitigates version control issues that can arise from repeated consumer use. Since a share is read-only, the number of consumers who download, interrogate, and examine the data will not affect its quality.
On the other hand, a share enables providers to set up automated functions that scan the data and measure key quality metrics. Snowflake, for example, offers pre-defined data metric functions (DMFs) to monitor the data’s quality, but it also enables other data share providers to customize their own DMFs, schedule assessments, and define when alerts regarding quality should be instigated.
In addition, a share can provide real-time data quality dashboards and reports that enable you to track and visualize the quality of your data, thereby reducing errors, risks and the time spent evaluating data for inconsistencies.
Governance: The Foundation for All Pillars
Governance is the set of policies, standards, and processes that define how data is collected, stored, accessed, and used across the enterprise. Cloud-based data governance can provide the tools and workflows to manage data policies, roles, and permissions. A data share enhances:
- Compliance: Knowing the state of your data and where it is helps you meet regulatory and industry standards
- Accountability: With clearly delineated roles and responsibilities among data stewards and engineers of a data share, teams can rely on quality data and meet client and partner goals.
- Data-driven culture: Accurate, easily accessible data fosters data literacy across the organization.
Data governance, then, is inextricably linked to data inventory, quality, and accessibility. Most important, a data share implements all encryption, backup, and recovery policies, as well as subscription rules and access requirements.
Cloud-Based Data Share Is the Future
Cloud-based data platforms offer tools to access, explore, and visualize data for various types of reporting and analytics. A secure data share is the foundation for an effective and scalable way to access high-quality data when and where you need it.
An experienced partner, an interoperable platform, and fit-for-purpose products, such as a data share, can help wealth management firms scale their operations in the cloud. By adopting best practices and using the right tools for data inventory, quality, governance, and accessibility, firms can overcome longstanding data challenges and successfully create and sustain a modern culture of data-driven growth.

The agency has made improvements to its IT security, Hood said, adding that the OCC is taking stock of “the extent to which highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions was compromised.”
Meanwhile, several large banks are limiting the information they share with the agency.
JPMorgan Chase has put a hold on sharing information electronically with the OCC, a source familiar with the matter told Banking Dive. The bank is ensuring that it’s communicating with its regulators safely, according to the source.
BNY has also paused sharing information over security concerns, sources told Bloomberg; as has Bank of America, sources told The Wall Street Journal.
Not all banks are limiting their info sharing. Citi, for one, hasn’t moved to do so, as it wasn’t in its practice to share classified information via email, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Citi declined to comment to Banking Dive, as did BNY. Bank of America did not return a request for comment.
The OCC will inform each regulated institution if the hackers accessed information specific to their company, Hood wrote. The agency will also provide all institutions with email addresses that were included in the compromised information so they can determine what information was shared with the OCC during the time frame the breach occurred.
The OCC is partnering with Microsoft Global Hunting Oversight and Strategic Triage, as well as cybersecurity firms Mandiant and CrowdStrike, to perform a full investigation relating to the incident. The agency has globally reset all credentials associated with its Microsoft tenant to eliminate further threat by the same hacker, Hood wrote.
During an internal review, the OCC found that hackers accessed sensitive information, Hood wrote. The OCC then determined the breach qualified as a “major incident” under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, meaning its either likely to “result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or the economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.”
The OCC learned Feb. 12 that an unauthorized user accessed a number of agency email accounts and activated incident response protocols, it said. The agency notified the public Feb. 26.
Hackers gained access to more than 100 email accounts and roughly 150,000 emails from May 2023 until February, including the mailboxes of senior deputy comptrollers and international banking supervisors, Bloomberg reported April 8, citing a draft letter to Congress."

The body of a New York City banker washed up on a beach in Spain — but his family continued searching for him for weeks because no one told them about the grisly discovery.
Grant Barr, a 37-year-old banker with BNY, disappeared on Jan. 28 while vacationing in Estepona on the Costa del Sol, mysteriously leaving only a pair of pants, passport and boating license on the beach.
His body washed ashore on March 3 but it was only identified in early April — meaning his family spent weeks desperately searching for him, not realizing he’d been found dead.
“After a week and back and forth between the courts and the coroner’s office, his remains were released on Friday and we were able to cremate him and finally bring him home,” Barr’s brother, James Barr, told the Spanish Eye about his brother.
“While the thoughts of a worst-case scenario came to mind from time to time, none of us actually thought this would ultimately be the outcome,” he continued.
James was frustrated that the report from Spanish police means “the last time we were all there searching for [Grant] two weeks he was already found, however, they didn’t even suggest that there was something they were looking into.”
Spanish authorities positively identified Barr using DNA, the family said. James, his other brother Luke and their mom immediately flew back across the Atlantic, where they met their father, who hadn’t left.
Officials have initially ruled his death a drowning.
“Our Brother passed on doing what he loved: facing the sea in its magnificent beauty and terrible might,” Grant’s brother Luke said in a statement through James.
Barr had traveled to Spain for a sailing getaway after going through a difficult breakup, according to EuroWeekly News.
His father, Michael, had previously recalled his son’s delicate emotional state before he vanished, including seeming paranoid about his family being in danger, according to the outlet.
Barr most recently worked at BNY, according to his LinkedIn profile. The New Jersey Institute of Technology graduate previously worked with other major corporations, including Citi.
“We are deeply saddened by the passing of our colleague, Grant Barr. On behalf of Grant’s coworkers and the entire BNY team, we wish to express our deepest sympathies to his family and will be supporting them at this incredibly difficult time,” a BNY spokesperson said.
Spain’s Guardia Civil and Policia Nacional have not commented on the new developments."

A foster parent and shelter worker, respectively, the pair attended the Carnegie Science Center’s Paws and Claws 21+ Night on Friday, April 11, to meet local animals in need of homes.
But by a little after 7 p.m., they’d traded barks and meows for mechanical whirs. Standing at a computer terminal, they designed a metal tag fit for a collar. With the push of a few buttons, the laser engraver to their left came to life, etching a design into a small metal round.
“It was faster than I imagined it was going to take,” Selva says.
“I’ve never etched before in my life — the guy had to repeat to us six or seven times how to do it. At 67 years old, I figure a few more dozen times, I would’ve been a pro at it.”
Selva and Prosek designed their tag in the science center’s new BNY Fab Lab in the third-floor space that was previously home to the Kitchen Theater.
The design and fabrication space houses laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) routers, desktop computers and even laptops for an overflow of designers. Renovations and the almost entirely new equipment were funded through a $1 million donation from financial services company BNY.
The Paws and Claws event was the first time the Fab Lab was open for a 21+ Night following its March 28, unveiling.
Even though the makerspace has been part of the science center’s programming for almost 10 years, you wouldn’t be alone if you haven’t stumbled upon it. Director Jason Brown calls its previous home in SportsWorks classrooms “off the beaten path.”
“While it was a great place for workshops that you could sign up for in advance and be directed to, it wasn’t the kind of place that was conducive to … popping in,” he says. “Its new location is right on the ramps. It’s behind a giant glass wall that can slide completely open, so everyone who walks on the ramps will pass right by it.”
Access to the Fab Lab is included in regular science center admission with no registration required. Courses and workshops do require additional tickets, which can be purchased through the science center’s website.
Brown wants patrons of all ages to pop in, digitally create their ideas and test out their designs — the same principles as a real manufacturing process called “rapid prototyping.”
“Before there were Fab Labs, and before there were things like 3D printers and laser cutters, if someone had a dream for an idea, they would have to design it and then probably draw it out and manually create it,” Brown says.
“The amazing thing about a Fab Lab is that you’ve already got the design created, so if it doesn’t work, you can make a quick tweak … and then, with the laser cutter, I can cut those things out in 15 seconds.”
In concept, the science center’s Fab Lab is not unique. When it originally opened in 2015, it was with grant support from the Fab Foundation — a nonprofit that supports the creation of Fab Labs nationwide. But Brown says the science center received a bunch of equipment with little guidance on teaching curriculum or methodology to use alongside it.
“That,” he says, “is what that team has really done: They built an entire philosophy around the equipment.”
“There are many makerspaces — many schools and community centers have makerspaces — but what sets ours apart is that it’s not about coming in and … downloading a design and then printing it. It’s about doing it yourself. How do I use this technology to answer questions that I have? Solve problems that I have?”
Like Selva and Prosek, Cianna Kisailus and her mother Holly also attended Paws and Claws night for the animals, but found themselves etching tags.
“A cat that we had passed away … from cancer, so we both made tags for her to put on a chain from us,” Holly says.
Cianna swiftly moved through heart-shaped designs for their late cat Oreo, a green bone with a pawprint for Holly’s dog Bandit and a circular tag for her current cat.
“Her name’s Zoe,” Cianna interjects. “She’s not little — she’s a chunky tabby, but she’s a good girl.”
The mother and daughter had both had brief encounters with 3D printing in the past, but never laser cutters. Still, Holly left the designing to her daughter.
“She’s the tech person,” she says.
“I picked up on it really quickly,” Cianna says. “There weren’t too many choices where you got flustered.”
“But now they’re done and they’re beautiful.”"
