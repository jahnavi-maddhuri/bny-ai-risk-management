BNY has successfully piloted the first intraday repo trade settled through its triparty infrastructure.
The transaction took place between UBS and Swiss Re in February, where UBS borrowed cash from Swiss Re while delivering collateral through BNY's platform.
BNY says that the successful transaction marks the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo, where the allocation and return of collateral will be settled intraday against payment.
The tri-party solution also allows firms such as UBS to source liquidity at a specified time, without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period.
Gesa Johannsen, BNY's executive platform owner, global collateral, says: ""Our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
Jason Crosskey, head of EMEA funding and optimisation solutions at UBS, adds: “This facility enhances intraday capabilities by allowing institutions to provide or access cash at specific times to better manage liquidity.”

EXHIBIT #1: U.S. EQUITY HOLDINGS DECLINE
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
By announcing sweeping tariffs, the U.S. is fundamentally changing its role in the global trading order. There are also uncertainties about the relative attractiveness of U.S. financial assets to overseas investors. It’s only been a few days since the tariff announcement on April 1, and the volatility of financial assets may obscure clear conclusions at this early stage, but early implications shed some light on how international investors are treating U.S. equities, Treasurys and the dollar. Initial conclusions suggest an air of caution in cross-border investment flows.
Let’s start with equities. We have argued, with evidence (see here, for example), that there is waning demand for U.S. equities following a long period of outperformance through most of the post-pandemic period. Until late last year, that is. As Exhibit #1 shows, U.S. equity holdings have been in almost steady decline since early December last year. Our 2025 annual outlook foreshadowed an end to so-called American exceptionalism, and we have indeed observed this phenomenon quite clearly. While U.S. holdings have declined since the end of last year, there has been a clear shift in equity allocations to Europe. Of course, there has been an appreciable drawdown in equity exposure across the world since tariffs were announced, as both U.S. and Eurozone equities have repriced lower on the news.
Again, we emphasize that it’s too early after the tariff storm has been unleashed to extrapolate short-term movements into long-term trends, but this is one that has persisted for a while, and one which makes a lot of sense. U.S. valuations had become stretched and market depth narrow, while growth prospects abroad were less ebullient – to say the least – than in the U.S. However, with tariff uncertainty now at its apex, and the effects on the U.S. relative the rest of the world equally uncertain, the unique attractiveness of U.S. assets is significantly diminished.
EXHIBIT #2: WHERE HAVE CROSS-BORDER INVESTORS GONE?
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Overseas demand for U.S. Treasurys has been a key concern of ours, and something we watch closely. Exhibit #2 shows cumulative daily flows (a way of measuring longer-term movements in underlying demand) since the beginning of 2024. As the chart shows, outside of the resolution of the 2024 debt ceiling episode, when cross-border investors piled into new T-bill issuance, flows have been mixed at best over this period. Note, in particular, over the same period – early December last year – when equity flows left the U.S. and headed into the Eurozone, U.S. Treasury flows have been generally underwater.
U.S. fiscal uncertainty is one plausible explanation, and again something we have been concerned about since the election. Extending the 2017 tax cuts will cost an estimated $4.5trn over the next 10 years, and it’s not clear that tariffs and budget cuts can offset the red ink from this policy. Static analysis suggests around $600bn per year will be raised from tariff revenues, but changing import behavior, declining domestic demand for higher priced and harder-to-source imports, and changing trade patterns could lead to merely half (or less) of that annual revenue actually being realized.
Yields on bonds outside the United States are competitive. Furthermore, fixed income investors typically hedge their overseas sovereign exposure back to local currency. Hedging costs for covering UST investments back into euros, for example are now at their highest level since mid-2022, at 2.1% reduce the overall take-home yield on, say, a 10y US T-note paying 4.2% by around half, whereas 10y German Bunds currently yield 2.6% in local terms, without the bother and volatility of hedging.
This is not to say that safe haven buying of USTs will no longer take place during times of market stress, and undoubtedly, the move in the 10y yield to below 4% at the end of last week was at least partially the result of a flight to safety. We have daily data on UST flows from abroad, shown in Exhibit #3. Thursday, April 3, the day after the tariff announcement, saw one of the biggest one-day inflows from abroad in several years. However, within a day, this flow had almost fully reversed and by yesterday was slightly negative. Total (i.e., cross-border and local) flows were still quite high on Friday, April 4 and Monday, April 7, but the absence of significant cross-border flow suggests it was primarily from U.S.-based investors.
EXHIBIT #3: A ONE-DAY RUSH INTO SAFE HAVENS, BUT PRECIOUS LITTLE OTHERWISE
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
These data are of great importance and something we monitor constantly. Tuesday’s barely passing 3-year auction and upcoming additional coupon placements the rest of this week could be illustrative of overall cross-border demand. The upcoming budget debate is also key, as we try to account for any increases in the deficit over the next several years. Our bias is to expect more – not less – red ink, potentially crimping demand from abroad."

The pilot demonstrated the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo with a specified start and end time through BNY’s triparty platform – whereby the allocation and return of eligible collateral is settled and matured intraday against payment.
“We are continuously evolving BNY’s platform infrastructure to unlock new trading patterns for the market,” said Gesa Johannsen, executive platform owner, global collateral, BNY. “Complementing our new early morning maturity option for triparty transactions in the US, our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
The intraday repo solution is designed to enable market participants to source liquidity for specified periods of time without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period. For lenders, such as Swiss Re in this case, the solution can provide an opportunity to generate additional income on excess, idle cash.
Richard Hochreutiner, head of global collateral at Swiss Re, said: “This is a great way to deploy any otherwise dormant intraday cash and to contribute to market liquidity. Using BNY’s platform seamlessly builds on existing infrastructure and documentation.”
In April, Banco Santander and Rabobank also completed an intraday triparty repo transaction, executing trades in both directions — borrowing and lending — through BNY’s collateral platform.
In March, the custodian also announced a partnership with GLMX to enable buy-side clients to direct repo trades at the point of execution to BNY Mellon’s triparty platform.
The two firms said the integration comes off the back of growing demand from clients seeking to expand their BNY Mellon triparty usage beyond uncleared margin into repo financing, helping them to capture more benefits from being on the collateral platform."

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) has successfully piloted the first intraday repo trade settled through its triparty infrastructure.
The USD-denominated pilot transaction, which took place in February, saw UBS borrowing cash from Swiss Re while delivering collateral via BNY’s global collateral platform.
The success of this pilot demonstrates the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo with a specified start and end time through BNY’s triparty infrastructure, whereby the allocation and return of eligible collateral is settled and matured intraday against payment. Additionally, market participants can access intraday repo through their existing triparty legal documentation on the BNY platform.
“We are continuously evolving BNY’s platform infrastructure to unlock new trading patterns for the market,” said Gesa Johannsen, Executive Platform Owner – Global Collateral, BNY. “Complementing our new early morning maturity option for triparty transactions in the U.S., our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
Leveraging its existing collateral platform infrastructure, BNY’s intraday triparty repo solution enables market participants, like UBS, to source liquidity for specified periods of time without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period. For lenders such as Swiss Re, the solution provides an opportunity to generate additional income on excess, idle cash.

In April, Banco Santander and Rabobank also successfully completed an intraday triparty repo transaction, executing trades in both directions — borrowing and lending – through BNY’s collateral platform. Settling both legs of the repo trade intraday provided the parties with enhanced flexibility, streamlined collateral management, and improved short-term funding efficiency. As triparty agent, BNY provided the infrastructure, collateral servicing, and settlement support required to enable this trade.
“We are pleased to have collaborated on one of the first intraday triparty repo trades in both directions,” said Enrique Verdu, Managing Director – Securities Finance, Banco Santander. “This represents meaningful progress in how we can manage and optimize intraday liquidity.”
“There is clear appetite from market participants like Rabobank for more dynamic and efficient short-term funding solutions,” added Allan Bolk, European Head – Securities Finance and Repo, Rabobank. “Executing both sides of the transaction intraday through a triparty setup delivers valuable optionality and operational ease.”"

As the chart above shows, these eras of market concentration rarely last.
What happens to so many of these large stocks in the subsequent decade? Dropping out of the top 10 could be due to any number of factors, from industry consolidation to regulation or a failure to innovate and adapt. Whatever the reason, it suggests that investors should be cautious about extrapolating today’s market trends too far into the future.
LONG-TERM LEADERS
Some companies do feature in the top 10 from one decade to another (and another). Until recently, companies such as Exxon, General Electric, and IBM were prominent members of the group regardless of the market trends.
Today, Microsoft is one of those staying the distance, having been there in the early 2000s and now very much part of the AI story today. This speaks to the software company’s continued ability to innovate and adapt from a leader in software to being at the forefront of AI, having first invested in OpenAI in 2019. More recently, it has incorporated Copilot, an AI-powered digital assistant, into Word, PowerPoint, Outlook and Excel. Looking to 2030 and beyond, we believe Microsoft will continue to rank highly.
Another is Alphabet, a business which has built up a dominant position in online advertising and search, through Google. Like Microsoft, it has also been in the AI game for years, having bought the UK-based AI research laboratory DeepMind back in 2014. Alphabet has a strong competitive position over the long term, thanks to its ownership of multiple platforms with billion-plus users, strong data-gathering capabilities, proprietary hardware and mobile operating systems (Android).
BEYOND SENTIMENT
It is still very early days for AI and progress is rarely linear. While, Walter Scott believes many of today’s market leaders will continue to play a critical role in the AI ecosystem for decades to come, history at least suggests that recent concentration levels are unlikely to persist."
