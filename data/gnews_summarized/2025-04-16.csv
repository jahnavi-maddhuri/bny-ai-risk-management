BNY's First-Quarter 2025 Market, Wealth Services Income Rises
The firm reported a broadly buoyant set of financial numbers for its different business divisions.
The market and wealth services business segment of BNY, the New York-headquartered group, said it logged pre-tax income in the first quarter of 2025 of $816 million, up 20 per cent on the same period a year earlier.
The market and wealth services business includes the Pershing business, which provides investment servicing and other services to wealth managers, family offices, and other financial institutions.
Total revenue stood at $1.686 billion in Q1 2025, rising 11 per cent on a year earlier, BNY said in a statement late last week.
Assets under custody/administration at the end of March were $14.7 trillion, rising 12 per cent.
In the securities services business segment, pre-tax income stood at $708 million, rising 20 per cent.
Across the whole of BNY, it had assets under management of $2 trillion, little changed on a year earlier. Diluted earnings were $1.58 per share in Q1 2025, rising 26 per cent, it said. The pre-tax operating margin was 32 per cent.
At the end of March, BNY had a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.5 per cent, up from 10.8 per cent a year earlier. The ratio is a standard international yardstick of a bank’s capital shock absorber. BNY returned $1.1 billion of capital to common shareholders through a mix of buybacks and dividend payments.
“Our work to operate BNY as a more platforms-oriented company, combined with our highly capitalized, liquid and lower credit risk balance sheet, positions us to manage dynamically and act as a source of strength as we support our clients in navigating the current environment,” Robin Vince, CEO, said in a statement."

A Texas appeals court has reaffirmed a lower court’s finding that The Bank of New York Mellon breached a foreclosure settlement agreement with homeowners David and Teresa Hall - but slashed their $1.36 million jury award by more than half, citing insufficient evidence for most of the emotional distress and credit damage claims.
The dispute stems from a 2017 Rule 11 Agreement - a judicially recognized settlement - that was intended to resolve earlier foreclosure litigation involving the Halls' home equity loan. Under the agreement, the loan was to be modified to a principal of $57,207.95 at 4% interest over 18 years. The agreement also required the Halls to make three specific trial payments and provided for $1,250 in additional compensation to them, while BNYM would handle escrow for taxes and insurance and adjust credit reporting according to standard procedures.
Although the Halls made all required payments and signed the documents, BNYM - through its servicer, Specialized Loan Servicing - never countersigned the modification. The Halls testified that their payments were inconsistently applied or returned, and that no formal modification was ever finalized. Their efforts to clarify the situation, they claimed, were met with delay and vague assurances.
In 2019, the Halls sued again, alleging that the bank had failed to honor the agreement, misrepresented the status of the modification, and harmed their credit through faulty reporting.
The Jefferson County jury found in favor of the Halls on multiple claims, including breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and deceptive conduct. It awarded more than $1.2 million in compensatory damages, including $90,000 for past credit harm, $250,000 for expected future credit injury, $700,000 for mental anguish, and over $135,000 in attorney’s fees. Prejudgment interest pushed the total to $1,359,071.20.
BNYM appealed, arguing that the Rule 11 Agreement was unenforceable and that there was no valid basis for tort-based damages. The Texas Court of Appeals disagreed on enforceability, finding that the agreement was valid and that BNYM had breached it. Testimony and correspondence presented at trial supported the conclusion that both parties intended to be bound by the settlement and understood that the trial payments would reduce the loan balance.
However, the appellate court reversed the verdict on multiple damages claims. It ruled that the $250,000 award for future credit damage, $90,000 for past credit harm, and $200,000 for future mental anguish were not supported by sufficient evidence. The court also suggested a remittitur - a voluntary reduction - of $450,000 in past mental anguish damages, leaving only $50,000 if the plaintiffs accept the adjustment. If not, a new trial on damages will be required.
Additionally, the court reversed the trial court’s award of $265,146.15 in attorney’s fees and remanded the fee issue for further proceedings.
The decision is a cautionary tale for mortgage servicers and investors in asset-backed certificates. It underscores the binding nature of Rule 11 Agreements in Texas and the risks of failing to follow through with modification terms—even when final documentation is incomplete.
Critically, the court held that oral assurances and partial compliance with settlement terms, combined with evidence of intent, were sufficient to create enforceable obligations. The servicer’s inconsistent treatment of borrower payments and failure to finalize terms led directly to the breach.
While emotional distress and reputational harm are more difficult to prove, the breach of contract finding stands as a stark reminder that borrowers are entitled to rely on settlements—especially after they've performed their part."

The agency has made improvements to its IT security, Hood said, adding that the OCC is taking stock of “the extent to which highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions was compromised.”
Meanwhile, several large banks are limiting the information they share with the agency.
JPMorgan Chase has put a hold on sharing information electronically with the OCC, a source familiar with the matter told Banking Dive. The bank is ensuring that it’s communicating with its regulators safely, according to the source.
BNY has also paused sharing information over security concerns, sources told Bloomberg; as has Bank of America, sources told The Wall Street Journal.
Not all banks are limiting their info sharing. Citi, for one, hasn’t moved to do so, as it wasn’t in its practice to share classified information via email, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Citi declined to comment to Banking Dive, as did BNY. Bank of America did not return a request for comment.
The OCC will inform each regulated institution if the hackers accessed information specific to their company, Hood wrote. The agency will also provide all institutions with email addresses that were included in the compromised information so they can determine what information was shared with the OCC during the time frame the breach occurred.
The OCC is partnering with Microsoft Global Hunting Oversight and Strategic Triage, as well as cybersecurity firms Mandiant and CrowdStrike, to perform a full investigation relating to the incident. The agency has globally reset all credentials associated with its Microsoft tenant to eliminate further threat by the same hacker, Hood wrote.
During an internal review, the OCC found that hackers accessed sensitive information, Hood wrote. The OCC then determined the breach qualified as a “major incident” under the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, meaning its either likely to “result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or the economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people.”
The OCC learned Feb. 12 that an unauthorized user accessed a number of agency email accounts and activated incident response protocols, it said. The agency notified the public Feb. 26.
Hackers gained access to more than 100 email accounts and roughly 150,000 emails from May 2023 until February, including the mailboxes of senior deputy comptrollers and international banking supervisors, Bloomberg reported April 8, citing a draft letter to Congress."

The body of a New York City banker washed up on a beach in Spain — but his family continued searching for him for weeks because no one told them about the grisly discovery.
Grant Barr, a 37-year-old banker with BNY, disappeared on Jan. 28 while vacationing in Estepona on the Costa del Sol, mysteriously leaving only a pair of pants, passport and boating license on the beach.
His body washed ashore on March 3 but it was only identified in early April — meaning his family spent weeks desperately searching for him, not realizing he’d been found dead.
“After a week and back and forth between the courts and the coroner’s office, his remains were released on Friday and we were able to cremate him and finally bring him home,” Barr’s brother, James Barr, told the Spanish Eye about his brother.
“While the thoughts of a worst-case scenario came to mind from time to time, none of us actually thought this would ultimately be the outcome,” he continued.
James was frustrated that the report from Spanish police means “the last time we were all there searching for [Grant] two weeks he was already found, however, they didn’t even suggest that there was something they were looking into.”
Spanish authorities positively identified Barr using DNA, the family said. James, his other brother Luke and their mom immediately flew back across the Atlantic, where they met their father, who hadn’t left.
Officials have initially ruled his death a drowning.
“Our Brother passed on doing what he loved: facing the sea in its magnificent beauty and terrible might,” Grant’s brother Luke said in a statement through James.
Barr had traveled to Spain for a sailing getaway after going through a difficult breakup, according to EuroWeekly News.
His father, Michael, had previously recalled his son’s delicate emotional state before he vanished, including seeming paranoid about his family being in danger, according to the outlet.
Barr most recently worked at BNY, according to his LinkedIn profile. The New Jersey Institute of Technology graduate previously worked with other major corporations, including Citi.
“We are deeply saddened by the passing of our colleague, Grant Barr. On behalf of Grant’s coworkers and the entire BNY team, we wish to express our deepest sympathies to his family and will be supporting them at this incredibly difficult time,” a BNY spokesperson said.
Spain’s Guardia Civil and Policia Nacional have not commented on the new developments."

A foster parent and shelter worker, respectively, the pair attended the Carnegie Science Center’s Paws and Claws 21+ Night on Friday, April 11, to meet local animals in need of homes.
But by a little after 7 p.m., they’d traded barks and meows for mechanical whirs. Standing at a computer terminal, they designed a metal tag fit for a collar. With the push of a few buttons, the laser engraver to their left came to life, etching a design into a small metal round.
“It was faster than I imagined it was going to take,” Selva says.
“I’ve never etched before in my life — the guy had to repeat to us six or seven times how to do it. At 67 years old, I figure a few more dozen times, I would’ve been a pro at it.”
Selva and Prosek designed their tag in the science center’s new BNY Fab Lab in the third-floor space that was previously home to the Kitchen Theater.
The design and fabrication space houses laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) routers, desktop computers and even laptops for an overflow of designers. Renovations and the almost entirely new equipment were funded through a $1 million donation from financial services company BNY.
The Paws and Claws event was the first time the Fab Lab was open for a 21+ Night following its March 28, unveiling.
Even though the makerspace has been part of the science center’s programming for almost 10 years, you wouldn’t be alone if you haven’t stumbled upon it. Director Jason Brown calls its previous home in SportsWorks classrooms “off the beaten path.”
“While it was a great place for workshops that you could sign up for in advance and be directed to, it wasn’t the kind of place that was conducive to … popping in,” he says. “Its new location is right on the ramps. It’s behind a giant glass wall that can slide completely open, so everyone who walks on the ramps will pass right by it.”
Access to the Fab Lab is included in regular science center admission with no registration required. Courses and workshops do require additional tickets, which can be purchased through the science center’s website.
Brown wants patrons of all ages to pop in, digitally create their ideas and test out their designs — the same principles as a real manufacturing process called “rapid prototyping.”
“Before there were Fab Labs, and before there were things like 3D printers and laser cutters, if someone had a dream for an idea, they would have to design it and then probably draw it out and manually create it,” Brown says.
“The amazing thing about a Fab Lab is that you’ve already got the design created, so if it doesn’t work, you can make a quick tweak … and then, with the laser cutter, I can cut those things out in 15 seconds.”
In concept, the science center’s Fab Lab is not unique. When it originally opened in 2015, it was with grant support from the Fab Foundation — a nonprofit that supports the creation of Fab Labs nationwide. But Brown says the science center received a bunch of equipment with little guidance on teaching curriculum or methodology to use alongside it.
“That,” he says, “is what that team has really done: They built an entire philosophy around the equipment.”
“There are many makerspaces — many schools and community centers have makerspaces — but what sets ours apart is that it’s not about coming in and … downloading a design and then printing it. It’s about doing it yourself. How do I use this technology to answer questions that I have? Solve problems that I have?”
Like Selva and Prosek, Cianna Kisailus and her mother Holly also attended Paws and Claws night for the animals, but found themselves etching tags.
“A cat that we had passed away … from cancer, so we both made tags for her to put on a chain from us,” Holly says.
Cianna swiftly moved through heart-shaped designs for their late cat Oreo, a green bone with a pawprint for Holly’s dog Bandit and a circular tag for her current cat.
“Her name’s Zoe,” Cianna interjects. “She’s not little — she’s a chunky tabby, but she’s a good girl.”
The mother and daughter had both had brief encounters with 3D printing in the past, but never laser cutters. Still, Holly left the designing to her daughter.
“She’s the tech person,” she says.
“I picked up on it really quickly,” Cianna says. “There weren’t too many choices where you got flustered.”
“But now they’re done and they’re beautiful.”"

“We are proud to play a role in supporting market developments on behalf of our clients, including offering digital asset custody for select crypto assets for U.S. based institutional clients, and are committed to building on our 240-year legacy of trust and innovation as we bridge the blockchain and traditional finance ecosystems.” —Marissa MacDonald, Head of Digital Assets Risk, Resiliency & Controls at BNY
Beyond their internal innovation, BNY has played a key role in shaping how Chainalysis supports the broader banking sector. Their leadership has not only influenced the direction of our solutions, but has also paved the way for other institutions to confidently navigate the world of digital assets.

Public-Private Partnership Award: NPCC National Cybercrime Team
Collaboration between the public and private sectors is essential to addressing today’s most complex challenges — the Public-Private Partnership Award celebrates exactly that. This award recognizes outstanding cross-sector efforts that drive innovation, enhance enforcement capabilities, and deliver meaningful outcomes for broader communities.
This year’s recipient, the UK’s NPCC National Cybercrime Team, has been a valued Chainalysis partner for many years. By leveraging Reactor, training programs, and investigative support, NPCC National Cybercrime Team has played a key role in combating illicit cryptocurrency activity across the UK. Recently, this relationship has evolved into a formal joint intelligence partnership, with Chainalysis investigators and data scientists working hand-in-hand with the NPCC National Cybercrime Team to proactively develop intelligence targeting asset seizure opportunities.
Andrew Gould accepted the award on behalf of the NPCC National Cybercrime Team.
“When we made our first crypto-related seizure over 10 years ago, we manually investigated the blockchain and wondered: ‘Where on earth are we going to store this?’ Now, Chainalysis tools are in the hands of officers across every cybercrime unit in the UK. The future for us is stepping deeper into operational partnerships, using blockchain not just to track, but alongside police tools to proactively locate and disrupt criminals globally. We’re incredibly excited and grateful for this recognition.” —Andrew Gould, Programme Lead, NPCC National Cybercrime Team.
A cornerstone of this collaboration is two-way data sharing — expanding enforcement capabilities and enabling faster, more effective disruption of criminal activity. The NPCC National Cybercrime Team has fully embraced the value of blockchain data as a core intelligence asset, and the results have been immediate and impactful.

Over 100 compromised email accounts, accessed for more than a year without detection, exposed privileged supervisory data about the financial health of major U.S. banks. In the aftermath, institutions like JPMorgan Chase and BNY Mellon scaled back electronic engagement with the OCC. Prioritizing internal risk posture over procedural convenience.
Now, the OCC is reshuffling its own architecture. Effective June 2, the regulator will consolidate its supervision units, merge policy and risk divisions, and elevate its Information Technology and Security (ITS) function to the agency’s executive committee. That last move is telling. After years of treating IT as a backend utility, the OCC appears to recognize that digital security is no longer operational support. It is a condition for legitimacy.
Why It Matters: When a regulatory body fails to detect a breach for more than a year, while it collects cybersecurity assessments from the very institutions it oversees, there is a more fundamental failure at play. It is about culture, architecture, and the trust contracts that define modern financial infrastructure.
Security has to be embedded in organizational design, not bolted on. The OCC’s restructure acknowledges this, albeit after the fact. Elevating IT and Security to the executive table sends the right signal. But it also underscores how far regulators have to go to meet the resilience standards they themselves enforce.
- Information Sharing Downgraded to Manual Workflows: JPMorgan and BNY Mellon, facing potential downstream exposure, scaled back electronic file transfers with the OCC. This shift reflects a breakdown in digital trust and highlights the operational impact of upstream security failures. When regulatory systems become liabilities, institutions are forced to default to slower, risk-contained alternatives.
- Supervision Functions Consolidated for Strategic Agility: The OCC is merging its Large Bank, Midsize and Community Bank Supervision units into a single Bank Supervision and Examination structure. The consolidation suggests an effort to reduce functional silos, improve cross-tier coordination, and create faster response capabilities. A move that mirrors how technology leaders are rethinking internal org design to support real-time adaptability.
- Risk and Policy Operations Brought Under Unified Leadership: By consolidating its Bank Supervision Policy and Supervision Risk and Analysis units under a reinstated Chief National Bank Examiner, the OCC is moving toward a more integrated risk-intelligence model. For CIOs, this underscores the value of aligning policy governance and threat detection under a unified operational lens.
- ITS Function Gets a Seat at the Strategy Table: Perhaps the most meaningful change is the creation of a new Senior Deputy Comptroller for Information Technology and Security. This role, reporting directly to the executive committee, reflects a governance model where cybersecurity is no longer peripheral. It reinforces the mandate for technology leaders to ensure security leadership is structurally embedded in strategic planning.
- Cultural Shift May Be the Hardest Lift: Reorganizations and title changes only go so far. The deeper challenge lies in embedding a risk-aware culture across regulatory and supervisory functions. Technology executives will recognize this as a familiar reality — that security maturity depends as much on behavior and accountability as it does on tools and frameworks.
