The solution will also produce early warning signals that flag potential credit deterioration, macro-adjusted PDs incorporating both climate and economic factors, and loss given defaults at the facility level.
“As the private credit market evolves, investors are looking for trusted independent assessments to help benchmark credit risk and inform investments and monitor portfolios,” Moody’s chief executive Rob Fauber said.
“Our partnership with MSCI will play a critical role in providing these insights, helping market participants make informed decisions.”
MSCI chief executive Henry A. Fernandez said the rapid growth of private credit continues to transform the global investment landscape while highlighting the need for increased transparency, consistent standards and independent risk assessment.

House Republicans Draft Cuts to Federal Employee Pensions
The changes would cause many government workers to contribute more, while receiving reduced benefits.
Federal employees’ pensions could undergo several changes that would gradually reduce their benefits, as part of a Republican federal budget resolution working its way through Congress.
Representative James Comer, R-Kentucky, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has offered proposals that would change how federal civilian employees’ benefits are calculated, which would make them pay more into the system while receiving reduced benefits, according to an April 25 release.
“The House Oversight Committee is taking a critical step to advance President [Donald] Trump’s America First agenda and ensure taxpayer dollars are used effectively, efficiently, and responsibly,” Comer said in a statement. “The Committee will consider legislation that delivers a substantial win for fiscal responsibility, achieving a reduction in the federal deficit of over $50 billion dollars.”
The committee is set to consider the legislation on Wednesday, April 30.
The proposal would raise federal and postal employees’ contribution rates to 4.4%, which the release estimated would raise $30.7 billion for the deficit reduction. The current contribution rates are based on each employee’s date of hire, as follows: 0.8% if hired in or before 2012; 3.1% if hired in 2013; and 4.4% if hired in or since 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The Federal Employees Retirement System is the retirement system for federal civilian employees. It provides benefits from three different sources: a Basic Benefit Plan, Social Security and the Thrift Savings Plan, a defined contribution plan. In fiscal 2022, more than 2.7 million people received federal civil service annuity payments; 56% received annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (which covers federal employees hired before 1984), and 44% received annuities under FERS, according to information from FERS and the Congressional Research Service.
For new federal retirees, the proposal would eliminate the extra retirement annuity payment currently provided to those who retire before age 62, lasting until they reach their Social Security retirement age and saving $10.1 billion, according to the release.
Federal pension benefits would also be reduced by basing retirees’ benefits on the highest average five years of salary, compared with the current standard of the highest average three years of salary, which would save $4.75 billion, according to the release.
Other changes include offering federal employees the option to “serve at will” to receive higher take-home pay, which would save $4.54 billion.
The proposals come as Republicans develop their larger federal budget resolution, which House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, has previously said he would like to finalize as early as May.
The House GOP has a goal of finding at least $2 trillion in savings to partially offset the cost of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts, as well as adding new cuts to taxes on overtime and tips. The Senate, in its version of the budget plan, has given itself leeway to make as little as $4 billion in cuts."

In the post-merger musical chairs at A&O Shearman, it seems quite a few partners couldn’t find a seat when the music stopped. Fifty nine partners have headed for the exit doors outside of Asia since the firm announced its plan to trim 10 percent of its global equity partnership last year.
According to Law.com’s recent tally, 25 of these departing partners hail from the US offices, with the remainder scattered across London, Europe, Africa, and Australia4. This exodus doesn’t even include the 15 partners who bid farewell from Asian offices, bringing the grand total to 74 partner departures worldwide.
A&O Shearman characterized these cuts as “a difficult but necessary step forward” following the May 2024 merger between Allen & Overy and Shearman & Sterling. About 45 of the departing partners have already found new homes at competing firms,
What’s particularly puzzling is that despite this mass exodus, A&O Shearman reports maintaining approximately 800 partners globally – roughly the same headcount they had when announcing the cuts. Perhaps the firm has mastered the art of the revolving door?
Or maybe the finessing comes down to some other factor we haven’t yet figured.
The explanation might lie in recent news that the firm is promoting 33 new lawyers to partnership effective May 1, 2025. While some partners pack up their offices, the firm appears to be simultaneously restocking its shelves with fresh talent.
This partner reshuffling comes amid A&O Shearman’s transition to an all-equity partnership model with a three-tier modified lockstep system, categorizing partners as ‘entry,’ ‘core,’ or ‘super’. The firm also closed its Johannesburg office and discontinued its consulting division as part of the post-merger restructuring."

Key Notes
- The TRUMP development team transferred $19.6 million worth of tokens to major exchanges.
- Market maker Cumberland DRW made a transfer of 300,000 TRUMP tokens to the OKX exchange.
- The dumping closely precedes the high-profile dinner with top TRUMP holders to be held on May 22.
US President Donald Trump‘s Official Trump TRUMP $4.79 24h volatility: 1.2% Market cap: $958.52 M Vol. 24h: $157.46 M token, which had recently skyrocketed following the hype surrounding a private dinner invitation with the POTUS, has come under severe pressure after a massive token dump by insiders.
At press time, the TRUMP token trades at a 5% loss, driven by a confluence of bearish catalysts, including over $24 million in combined token offloading by the team and market makers.
TRUMP Team and Cumberland Flood the Market
According to on-chain analytics from Lookonchain, wallets linked to the TRUMP team deposited $19.6 million worth of tokens across major centralized exchanges, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit.
A wallet linked to the $TRUMP team deposited 1,346,000 $TRUMP($19.58M) into #Binance, #OKX, and #Bybit 9 hours ago.https://t.co/Mkk5VIjIFW pic.twitter.com/G4cuIBrQVq
— Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 29, 2025
The breakdown:
- Binance: 700,000 TRUMP tokens, worth approximately $10.21 million
- OKX: 350,000 tokens, valued at $5.1 million
- Bybit: 296,000 tokens, totaling around $4.3 million
Adding to the sell pressure, prominent market maker Cumberland DRW transferred an additional 300,000 TRUMP tokens to OKX, amounting to $4.4 million.
Combined, this represents over $24 million in token deposits, a move that has triggered panic among retail holders. The timing, just weeks ahead of the high-profile May 22 dinner, has amplified concerns that insiders may be exiting.
Notably, Democratic US Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren have formally requested an ethics inquiry into the private dinner hosted by Trump for TRUMP token holders.
Their April 25 letter to Office of Government Ethics Director Jamieson Greer highlights that the dinner, which coincided with a sharp price rally, may have misled investors and influenced financial markets.
Technical Analysis: Signs of Exhaustion and Bearish Reversal
As of press time, TRUMP trades at $14.11, down from a recent high of $15.59. The token has breached key support at the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level ($14.12) and is now flirting with the 0.786 level at $13.78.
If it fails to hold here, the next major downside target lies at the 1.618 Fib extension around $11.86, followed by deeper support at $9.56 and $7.26.
The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped to 62.59, cooling off from its recent overbought levels above 80. This RSI divergence suggests bullish momentum is fading. A drop below 50 could confirm a stronger bearish breakdown.
Meanwhile, Bollinger Bands (BB) are beginning to squeeze, signaling declining volatility and the potential for a decisive move. Price action breaking below the mid-band (20 SMA), currently at $14.02, hints at weakening support.
A bullish scenario would require TRUMP to reclaim the upper Fib levels, particularly the $15.00–$15.59 zone. A close above this resistance could open the door to new highs.

Every seasoned investor will be grimly aware of the perils of market timing. It is a rare investor who doesn’t let FOMO get the better of them occasionally. Most will be familiar with the glee of rushing headlong into a popular investment, only to experience a Homer Simpson ‘Doh!’ moment after.
With this in mind, it’s important to think long term and remember that volatility, which markets have been experiencing over the past couple of months, is par for the course. While it’s hard to resist the urge to make changes when investments fall in value, adopting a buy and hold strategy helps manage the inevitable cycles of fear and greed that comes with volatile stock markets and herd behaviour.

That is prudent: markets swing around frequently, and can appear to be a ‘random walk’ over short periods of time. This approach, though, often goes against our human nature, which compels us to take action. A good way to help us keep a healthy, long-term approach is to identify fund managers that we can put our trust in to navigate markets for our benefit over different cycles.”
Buying and holding funds is not easy
But, as Assimakos admits, finding these fund managers is not easy. Something can be a great investment one minute, and a pretty awful one the next. The market environment may change, new technologies emerge, fund managers leave, and not all investment ideas work perfectly.
Daniel Lockyer, senior fund manager at Hawksmoor Fund Managers, outlines the difficulty: “The problem with choosing a single equity fund or a bond fund to own forever, is that market conditions and valuations change, meaning future returns can look more or less attractive at certain points in time. Even regular rebalancing of rigid asset allocations like the traditional 40/60 equity bond portfolios can become unstuck, as they did in 2022 when bond yields were close to 0% at the start of that year and equity valuations were high.”
Inbuilt adaptability
Nevertheless, with this caveat, there are certain qualities that make funds more appropriate as a buy and hold option. For example, funds that fulfil this brief are likely to need some kind of inbuilt adaptability – the ability to bend and sway with the market environment. Someone at the helm will be taking account of market pricing, and a changing market environment.
Lockyer believes it is only truly active multi-asset funds that can have this adaptability.
He says: “That is the very intention of that type of fund, given investors are ‘outsourcing’ asset allocation and fund selection to experts.”
Lockyer says of the Hawksmoor multi-asset funds, “today’s portfolio has a different set of assets and allocation compared to the one five years ago, which had a different portfolio to the one 10 years ago. Evolving the portfolio to current conditions within one fund structure means the fund acts like a swan, with lots happening beneath the surface that investors don’t see.”

John Monaghan, research director, Square Mile Investment Consulting and Research, suggests the BNY Mellon Multi-Asset Balanced fund. This is a multi-asset portfolio with a bias towards equities. He adds: “The simplicity of the fund's structure is attractive, along with its experienced manager and the large, dedicated global analyst team that supports him. The portfolio is invested in global equities which they believe will benefit from a range of structural themes and forces for change in the world.
“The investment process favours businesses that are well managed, have strong balance sheets, good cash flows and which are attractively valued. These businesses tend to have more defensive characteristics and should hold up better than the broader market when equity markets are falling.”
Assimakos’ choice is Troy Capital’s Trojan fund. This isn’t a conventional multi-asset fund, but it blends shares in high-quality businesses around the world while balancing out the stock market risks with the use of inflation-linked bonds and gold bullion. “A fund like this would naturally underperform stock markets when they are rallying but through its history, it has managed to deliver positive returns in most market environments, avoiding deep losses at any given time.”
Future proofing
A buy and hold fund is also likely to need some kind of future proofing. This is where passive strategies - index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) - often fall down. They are good at running with yesterday's winners, but less good at pivoting to the next technology hotspot or adapting to changes in the market environment. A portfolio of AI-focused technology stocks has served investors extremely well over the past decade, but if a fund is really a buy and hold option, it needs the flexibility to find the next winners as well.
This means not being too dogmatic. Lockyer: “If choosing a single equity fund, it must be managed by a style-agnostic manager who will invest across all regions and market caps – and there are not many of those around.”

Nevertheless, Rob Burdett, head of multi-manager at Nedgroup Investments, believes there are some funds that stand the test of time. “Rathbone Global Opportunities Fund, run by James Thomson, can be volatile, but very worthwhile over the long term as it is focused, growthy and ideal for the long term.
“Another is Artemis Income fund run by Adrian Frost and team. I always admire the way Adrian focuses on the fact that he is looking after his investors’ life savings (which many managers forget!) and although a ‘veteran’ to some, he has instilled his beliefs in his team. An income fund can be a great ‘forever fund’ as you get comfort from a decent part of the return being delivered in regular income payments.”
Monaghan says that the Brown Advisory Global Leaders fund also fits the bill. “The investment process is incredibly well thought out and is separated into two distinct processes giving equal attention to both stock selection and capital allocation, which is a key contribution to the fund’s performance.”
High-growth options
High-volatility single strategy funds focused on areas with a strong pathway of growth might also qualify. Burdett gives the example of India funds. India has a huge long-term growth trajectory, with compelling demographics, and a strong reform agenda. He says: “Investing in one of the world’s fastest-growing countries with the world’s largest population, the long-term returns should overcome some current high valuations in the market.” On interactive investor’s Super 60 list of fund ideas is GS India Equity, while Asia-Pacific investment trust Pacific Assets Ord (LSE:PAC) has India as its biggest country weighting at 35%. Pacific Assets is on our ACE 40 list of sustainable fund ideas.
Assimakos likes the TM Natixis Loomis Sayles US Equity Leaders fund. “As the name suggests, it invests exclusively in US-listed stocks but seeks to identify companies with outsized growth potential that trade at a discount to their intrinsic valuation. Of course, its all-equity nature means that there have been periods of time when the fund’s valuation fell significantly, but it has recovered well in all past occasions.”
Certainly, buy and hold cannot mean set and forget, says Burdett. He believes investors should strive to know the funds they hold as well as they possibly can: “We encapsulate this thinking as ‘being the best-informed investor we can be’. The subsequent regular checking is because things change – fund managers move, teams alter, corporate mergers happen in asset management, and investment conditions and opportunities come and go.”

Equally, investors need to be sure that the fund manager is sticking to their knitting. Assimakos believes that the quickest path to ruin for a fund manager is to lose sight of their “true north” and start flip-flopping from one investment style to another in panic. He believes the best fund managers should be unwavering in their philosophy and style of investing and understand that there may be brief periods when their style is not the most popular, or even profitable.
“No fund manager makes great returns in all market environments, but the best ones do not suffer steep losses even during unfavourable times.”
True buy and hold options may be rare, but they do exist. Finding them is worthwhile, because it helps investors stay invested over time. They will also be a welcome option for those who would rather not have to micromanage their investments day to day, even if buy and hold cannot mean forgetting about them entirely.

Pune among fastest-growing job markets, sees 39% YoY increase
While Bengaluru and Hyderabad continue to dominate hiring, Pune has emerged as a fastest-growing job market, registering 7% month-on-month growth and 39% year-on-year growth, according to foundit Insights Tracker (previously known as Monster Employment Index) for February 2025.
Pune: A thriving tech ecosystem, rising presence of global capability centres (GCCs) and rich pool of students have made the city one of the fastest-growing job markets in the country.
While Bengaluru and Hyderabad continue to dominate hiring, Pune has emerged as a fastest-growing job market, registering 7% month-on-month growth and 39% year-on-year growth, according to foundit Insights Tracker (previously known as Monster Employment Index) for February 2025.
""With a 70% surge in GCCs - from 210+ in 2019 to 360+ in 2024 - the city has evolved into a strategic hub for global enterprises, driven by high-value, innovation-led work,"" said Karthik Padmanabhan, managing partner - GCC Business, Zinnov, a global management and strategy consultancy firm. The city continues to attract global players like Dassault Systemes, Tenerity, DataAxle even as BNY Mellon and American Express expand their footprints.
""Pune has emerged as one of the strongest hiring hubs, keeping pace with major metros like Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. Its steady job market growth reflects sustained demand across industries, particularly in manufacturing, IT, healthcare, and BFSI. Pune's expansion has been more balanced, with both short-term and long-term hiring trends showing resilience,"" said V Suresh, CEO, foundit. Neeti Sharma, CEO, TeamLease Digital, said the hiring momentum remained high in the city, with companies actively recruiting software developers, AI specialists, and cyber security experts. ""Pune's tech job market is a key driver of growth in India, strengthening its position as a major hub for technology hiring. It ranks among our top four cities for business, and we expect around 10% year-on-year growth from this region,"" she said.
The reason why the city is emerging as a fastest-growing job market is because it offers a strong talent pool and lower cost compared to tier-1 cities. According to the latest LinkedIn Jobs on the Rise in Pune (2025), a data-backed ranking of the 10 fastest-growing jobs over the past three years - jobs like strategy manager, AI engineer, travel consultant, psychologist, and sales development representative were among the top fastest-growing jobs.
""With Pune emerging as a preferred destination for global innovation centres and deep-tech startups, demand for skills in AI, cloud computing, and automation is also surging,"" said Yeshab Giri, chief commercial officer, professional talent solutions, Randstad India, a talent company.
