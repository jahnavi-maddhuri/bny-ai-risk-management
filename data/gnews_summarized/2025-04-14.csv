EXHIBIT #1: CROSS-BORDER SELLING OF USTS SINCE APRIL 2
Source:BNY Markets, iFlow
Our iFlow data confirms that cross-border investors are exiting U.S. dollar-denominated financial assets. Last week, our U.S. Treasury flow registered its third largest outflow by foreign-based investors since the early days of the pandemic. As Exhibit #1 shows, cross-border outflows from USTs have been almost entirely across the yield curve, with only the very long (10y and higher) segment seeing inflows from abroad.
The sharp sell-off in bond yields, with the 10y note pushing up to 5.7% intraday at the end of last week, has keyed speculation in the markets of foreign shedding of USD-based assets and musings about “de-dollarization”, or the beginning of the end of the USD as a global reserve currency. Even with the DXY U.S. dollar index moving below 100, we think that discussion is premature from a long-term structural economic perspective. There is no doubt that U.S. assets, including Treasuries, are seeing increased selling pressure.
Exhibit #1 shows average daily flows (on a scored basis) for different yield buckets on the curve and cash and short-term instruments (“CAST”) since April 3, the first day after the administration announced sweep universal and retaliatory tariffs. While the selling – save for the very long end – has been unequivocal, it is hardly a recent development.
EXHIBIT #2: FLOWS WEAKER SINCE BEGINNING OF YEAR
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Exhibit #2 shows cumulative cross-border flows into (or out of) USTs over the past twelve months, starting on April 12, 2024. We accumulate overseas flows every day, allowing us to see the ebbs and flows of foreign demand. In mid-2024, after the resolution of the debt ceiling crisis, we see a large jump in foreign inflows into USTs, primarily due to a slew of T-bill issuance that occurred upon the debt ceiling’s resolution. From that point on, save for a few brief and discernable episodes – like October 2024 and late December last year- foreign demand has been tepid at best. By the end of 2024 and early 2025, we have observed persistent and sustained selling by foreign domiciled real money investors, reaccelerating after early April 2025.
EXHIBIT #3: EXITING US FIXED INCOME
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
We have seen evidence of foreign selling across other USD assets as well. In U.S. equities, selling by cross-border investors has been persistent since late 2024. Across non-UST fixed income assets, we see selling in MBS securities, munis, and corporate bonds over the past 5 days. This shedding of USD-denominated assets is broad based, as seen in Exhibit #3.
Forward look
Foreign investors exiting USD denominated assets, especially in fixed income, has been a feature of post-election U.S. markets. However, since April 2, it has accelerated and become broad-based, which we don’t think is a short-lived phenomenon. While U.S. economic policy uncertainty remains at historically high levels and U.S. asset volatility is similarly elevated, investors remain skittish. Additionally, the Federal Reserve argues that rates are on hold until clear signs of weakness in U.S. growth data emerge."

Data has become the lifeblood of wealth management firms, but managing it effectively poses numerous challenges. From data silos to disconnected technology, firms can struggle to find an enterprise view. And, if data isn’t harmonized across the organization, it’s hard to use for gleaning insights, growing businesses, and adapting to the fast-changing and demanding financial market.
Many wealth management firms have turned to the cloud for data management, but shifting data, pipelines and operations to the cloud is not a magic bullet. Firms also must have both a clear strategy and robust framework for maintaining the accessibility, catalogue, quality, and governance of their data. A secure data share can help an enterprise uphold these four pillars of cloud data management.
What Is a Data Share?
As its name suggests, a data share is a tool in a data consumption solution that shares data from one cloud-based account with other cloud-based accounts. More technically, a share is a package of data offerings on a cloud account that other data consumers can subscribe to. In addition, shared database objects are immutable, as they are read-only and cannot be altered.
BNY and Snowflake: A Powerful Data Share Team
The flexibility of a Snowflake share enables consumers to enhance their data sets, and they can then share data back with the provider1. With the data located in one place, consumers know where to find data, when they need it. Moreover, a unique differentiator of Snowflake is that there is no file transfer, which means data is immediately available for reading.
Clients without a Snowflake account can participate in a data share via an authentication process that links the client’s chosen cloud account to BNY’s Snowflake instance. In either circumstance, the near-instantaneous access to high-quality data offers firms the tools to collaborate, innovate, and grow.
Accessibility: The Key to Collaboration
Access to data is necessary for any aspect of wealth management—be it estate planning, investment management, business succession, and more. When teams across the enterprise can access data across the firm, they can collaborate more easily, which in turn enables them to:
- Solve business challenges to improve performance and outcomes.
- Drive innovation to create new products, services, and business models.
- Enhance differentiation to gain an edge over competitors.
With a cloud data share, data is accessible in near real time. In BNY’s Snowflake data share, BNY aggregates data from multiple sources and then makes it accessible to the consumer via either a subscription or authentication process. This way, data consumers within BNY and data consumers who are clients of BNY can easily access the data they need. In addition, since cloud updates are nearly instantaneous, consumers can be sure they are working with the latest information.
Catalogue: Benefiting from a Data Superset
Nevertheless, access to data is not enough. Consumers must also be able to find the right data at the right time. A data share offers a centralized, easy-to-use data catalogue. The distinct data marts in a share are large databases organized around a unifying principle. Just as a library has different sections (e.g., Fiction, Young Adult, Nature), a data share provider offers various data marts (e.g., Accounts, Transactions, Market Value). Within each share that consumers subscribe to, data is documented and organized.
For instance, one firm might only subscribe to streaming custody data, but another may subscribe to both streaming data and the derived data that provides performance information. Regardless of their subscription details, both firms can:
- Scan and index data sources across platforms and environments
- Identify the gaps and overlaps in their data landscape
- Optimize data storage and performance
The result is a wealth management data superset fit for purpose. Data consumers know what data assets they have, where they are, how they’re structured, and who owns them.
Quality: Confidence Behind Innovation
Knowing where and how to find data is great, but data integrity and quality are also critical to addressing business needs. On the one hand, a share mitigates version control issues that can arise from repeated consumer use. Since a share is read-only, the number of consumers who download, interrogate, and examine the data will not affect its quality.
On the other hand, a share enables providers to set up automated functions that scan the data and measure key quality metrics. Snowflake, for example, offers pre-defined data metric functions (DMFs) to monitor the data’s quality, but it also enables other data share providers to customize their own DMFs, schedule assessments, and define when alerts regarding quality should be instigated.
In addition, a share can provide real-time data quality dashboards and reports that enable you to track and visualize the quality of your data, thereby reducing errors, risks and the time spent evaluating data for inconsistencies.
Governance: The Foundation for All Pillars
Governance is the set of policies, standards, and processes that define how data is collected, stored, accessed, and used across the enterprise. Cloud-based data governance can provide the tools and workflows to manage data policies, roles, and permissions. A data share enhances:
- Compliance: Knowing the state of your data and where it is helps you meet regulatory and industry standards
- Accountability: With clearly delineated roles and responsibilities among data stewards and engineers of a data share, teams can rely on quality data and meet client and partner goals.
- Data-driven culture: Accurate, easily accessible data fosters data literacy across the organization.
Data governance, then, is inextricably linked to data inventory, quality, and accessibility. Most important, a data share implements all encryption, backup, and recovery policies, as well as subscription rules and access requirements.
Cloud-Based Data Share Is the Future
Cloud-based data platforms offer tools to access, explore, and visualize data for various types of reporting and analytics. A secure data share is the foundation for an effective and scalable way to access high-quality data when and where you need it.
An experienced partner, an interoperable platform, and fit-for-purpose products, such as a data share, can help wealth management firms scale their operations in the cloud. By adopting best practices and using the right tools for data inventory, quality, governance, and accessibility, firms can overcome longstanding data challenges and successfully create and sustain a modern culture of data-driven growth.

The breach, detected in mid-February but impacting over 100 accounts for more than a year, is deemed a “major incident” by the OCC and the U.S. Treasury. The compromised emails may contain highly sensitive data provided by banks, including details on their financial health, cybersecurity protections, vulnerability assessments, and even the content of National Security Letters. These letters often involve confidential information related to terrorism and espionage investigations.
According to Bloomberg, the banks’ decision to limit information sharing stems from concerns about potential security risks to their own computer networks in the wake of the OCC breach. Representatives for JPMorgan and BNY declined to comment. A spokesperson for the OCC told the network that the agency is working with third-party cybersecurity experts to review the hack and its IT security policies and is keeping supervised institutions informed. The OCC also affirmed that onsite examiners retain necessary access to bank information.
Citigroup, operating under a tighter OCC consent order, has reportedly not limited its information sharing. It remains unclear if other major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have taken similar actions as JPMorgan and BNY.
Bloomberg’s sources indicate that some banks were unaware of the breach’s full extent until recent reporting, raising questions about the OCC’s initial response and security measures. The OCC is still working to determine the exact scope of the data compromised and whether affected banks need to be notified.
The incident has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which are seeking more information from the OCC. David P. Weber, a former OCC enforcement counsel, described the banks’ actions as a “historic” challenge to the regulator’s authority, signaling a “fundamental breakdown of the examination authority of the OCC.”

Experts quoted in the Bloomberg report warn that the compromised material could be used for targeted cyberattacks or extortion against banks. The breach highlights the cybersecurity risks within the financial sector and has eroded trust between banks and their regulator. The OCC has disclosed some affected staff accounts to the banks but has not yet detailed the types of data stolen, including cybersecurity-related information."

Providing Asiaâs EAMs With Heavy-Hitting Support â BNY Pershing
In this continuing series, we talk to BNY Pershing about the work it does with EAMs in Singapore and other financial centres in the region.Â
This news service is continuing to track how banks and other financial services firms serve Asiaâs external asset managers, with a particular focus on Singapore, but also other centres such as Hong Kong. (See previous articles here, here, here and here.)
These articles come ahead of our scheduled WealthBriefingAsia EAM Awards 2025, taking place on 16 October, in Singapore. Nominations for entries are open.
In this article, we talked to the
firm about what it does and its views about the
sector.
Please explain your EAM offering
BNY Pershing
offers a wealth services platform to external asset managers and
advisory firms across the region. This platform provides a range
of services including execution and custody, which allows them to
provide access to their clients to a number of financial assets
and markets, helping them help more people.
BNY Pershing has a number of longstanding client relationships across the region, doing business for more than 20 years. We also support a number of innovative firms globally. (BNY Pershing gave the case of its support for US-headquartered Arta Wealth Managementâs public launch in Singapore, in October 2024. Arta uses Pershing to support its clients across both its US and international client base.)
How important is the EAM business line to the firm in
general, for example, for revenue growth, etc?
BNY Pershing is seeing significant growth both internationally
and within Asia Pacific and we expect this to continue to benefit
the industry and our business.
When dealing with EAMs, what are the main tasks and forms
of support they ask for the most and why, in your
experience?
Most queries are product-based in nature, inquiring about
different assets and markets available via the platform
(structured, alternatives, funds, fixed income or traditional
equities) or different reporting and analytical capabilities. BNY
Pershing has a professional and an investor portal, the latter
which can be white labelled and offered directly to the advisorsâ
UHNW clients.
How important has the rise of Singapore-based Variable
Capital Companies (VCCs) been in driving what EAMs
do?
Weâve certainly seen the rise of VCCs in driving what EAMs do,
attracting Southeast Asian investorsâ capital â particularly
the HNW/UHNW segment. For BNY, VCCs focused on alternative
investments have been an important area within BNYâs Asset
Servicing Business, where we can provide a full suite of fund
administration and custody solutions today.
Interestingly over the last nine to 12 months weâve also seen a shift in VCC interest from regional EAMs to global EAMs targeting Southeast Asian-based investor capital, using VCCs for access funds. More broadly we see the rise of VCCs as a driver of change and innovation in the funds industry across the region, from the launch of the Hong Kong LP structure to some of the recent announcements from the [Hong Kong] Securities and Futures Commission relating to alternative Hong Kong OFCs [open-ended fund companies], amongst others.
Regulatory issues remain important, and Singapore is of
course no exception, along with Southeast Asia more generally.
Are there topics that are particularly front of mind at the
moment?
Weâve certainly seen an increased focus on resiliency, client
asset safety, and transparency over the years. Resiliency is core
to our commercial business model, and our EAM clients benefit
from the same resiliency being used to service most of the
largest institutions in the world.
We have heavily invested in our core technology stack, modernising our infrastructure, and deploying active data centres. We are also market leading in leveraging AI/ML tools with one practical example being anomaly detection in our transaction and messaging flows. At times, this has allowed us to identify and escalate infrastructure issues or cybersecurity threats originating from outside of our organisation directly to our clients allowing them to mitigate the impact.
We also see that several markets are actively encouraging diversification and globalising their investments to increase retirement income and returns, in part to combat ageing populations. This includes a move to self-directed portfolios with a greater penetration and reliance on financial advice.
How is digital technology shaping the sort of custody
services you provide, for example affecting its cost, range of
service, etc?
Depth, quality, and sophistication of product capabilities is
increasingly important, and a unique competitive advantage across
the BNY group which includes the largest global custodian, the
largest agent lender, the largest US clearing broker dealer, and
access to a wide range of assets.
We provide our clients with unique access to this ability to scale, innovate, and deliver to their client base. One example specific to EAMs and wealth management is the additional portfolio yield that can be generated by participating in a fully-paid securities lending programme. We provide EAMs with direct visibility on the potential revenue that a clientâs asset portfolio could yield if they participated in securities lending so that they can drive meaningful client conversations.
Another example might be our algorithm [algo]-based fixed income portfolio construction, optimisation, and trading solution â BondWise. It helps advisors construct and optimise client portfolios while aggregating liquidity.
Finally, a last example might be our âMoney in Motionâ analytics screen which allows advisors to monitor and identify client asset flows quickly across their client base. Not all products and services are offered in all countries."

The new feature will enable eToro users based in the UK and Europe to earn passive income by lending out their stocks.
While BNY will act as the custodian, the companies will work with stock lending platform EquiLend to identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
Eligible eToro users will be given the option to opt into the programme, with their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending.
Once opted in, eToro said users will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earn in the specified period.
Only whole unit stock positions are eligible for lending and eToro said that fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.
The company added that stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
Users who lend their stock temporarily give ownership of the stocks to the borrower and lose voting rights while the stock is on loan. However, eToro said they can still receive dividends, sell the stocks or opt out of the programme at any time at no cost.
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+ and Diamond Club members, with this followed at a later date by lower-tier Club members.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way, yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets,” said Yossi Brandes, VP execution services at eToro. “Leveraging BNY’s Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,”
