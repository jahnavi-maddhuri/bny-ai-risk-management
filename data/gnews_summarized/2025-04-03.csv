This innocuous sounding product is rather important. And while not rocket science, it is groundbreaking. The world’s largest global custodian will be feeding data about the assets it is administrating directly to public blockchains. In some ways, that’s better than an audit, because it’s up to date and directly from source.
In the recent past there has been a lot of debate about so-called ‘proof of reserves’, which in some cases are prone to manipulation. Proof for real world asset (RWA) tokenization is even more important because the token is often a digital twin that represents an asset held outside a blockchain. In the case of a money market fund, the assets often involve Treasuries.
So far the best we’ve seen in terms of proof is a pdf downloaded from a fund accounting system and posted to the internet. If someone wanted to commit fraud, it would be incredibly easy to automatically tweak and upload fraudulent data. The Circle stablecoin is somewhat better because its reserves are mostly managed by BlackRock, which posts the assets in the fund to its website on a daily basis.

This reflects the growing sophistication of a new class of tokenized funds operated by firms like BlackRock, which will be the first to use the new BNY tool.
The launch represents a fresh foray by BNY into the volatile blockchain sector, which has been buoyed by a favorable U.S. regulatory landscape as President Trump pushes a pro-crypto agenda at every level of government. In March, BNY head of digital assets Caroline Butler testified before the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing on stablecoins.
“Embracing blockchain technology in connecting the traditional and digital markets is consistent with BNY’s long track record of supporting innovation in the global financial system,” she said at the hearing.
In an interview with Fortune, Butler said the new product will allow more up-to-date transparency around tokenized funds—a fast-growing new category of funds, which resemble traditional funds but where the underlying assets are recorded and transferred on the blockchain. BNY’s new product can, in turn, improve the credit rating of the funds.
“Because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this,” she told Fortune. “It sits right in that sweet spot as we continue to add more and more value for clients.”
On-chain data
While the crypto sector began in 2008 with the introduction of Bitcoin, traditional financial institutions like BNY have been hesitant to enter the space, largely because of regulatory uncertainty. Still, BNY has shown an interest in the technology, including launching a digital asset custody platform that allowed clients to hold Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, with the bank.
The plan, however, clashed with the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Biden Administration, which issued guidance surrounding balance sheet requirements for companies holding crypto assets for clients.
After putting its custody product on hold and continuing to build out its tokenization capabilities, BNY received an exemption in 2024 that allowed it to custody Bitcoin and Ethereum held for exchange-traded products without it being treated as a balance-sheet liability, and soon after received approval to hold crypto assets for other purposes. Under Trump, the SEC quickly rescinded the previous guidance, known as SAB 121, which was broadly unpopular among banks and crypto firms.
BNY’s latest crypto product moves beyond custody, and reflects the growth of financial instruments launched on blockchains, such as BlackRock’s on-chain money market fund, BUIDL. Larry Fink, BlackRock’s CEO, has publicly argued that more and more financial assets will be tokenized to improve cost and efficiencies, though the technology has still been limited to specific pilots and a largely blockchain-native customer base.
Put in simple terms, the new tool will allow BNY to post the net asset value, or NAV, for tokenized funds directly onto the blockchain, rather than having to rely on the accounting of third-party services to furnish this information. Butler said that the product will help investors see the up-to-date NAV of financial instruments such as BUIDL, which in turn will drive more creditworthiness.
While Butler acknowledged that this type of data sharing is not unique to crypto, she said that BNY’s blockchain enables the company to offer a fuller suite of tools around tokenized funds. “It’s just a use case to demonstrate how you can actually now start to make information more available to everybody that needs it,” she told Fortune.
BlackRock, which relies on BNY as the fund administrator and custodian for BUIDL, will be the first client to use the tool. “BNY’s enablement of off-chain data insights to public blockchains is an unprecedented event and a significant milestone for the industry,” said Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, in a statement shared with Fortune.
As BNY continues to push into the digital asset space, Butler said that it will expand the data product to other companies offering the tokenized fund based on client demand, though she declined to share whether BNY is working on additional blockchain tools. “We have the opportunity to operate at all parts of that fund life cycle and the assets life cycle,” she said."

Major lenders and mortgage servicers are facing class-action lawsuits in New York over allegations that they inflated foreclosure-related charges on home equity loans, improperly costing homeowners thousands of dollars.
The lawsuits, filed Thursday in US federal court in Brooklyn, claim that lenders and their servicing partners wrongly applied compound interest instead of simple interest during a critical stage of the foreclosure process. Specifically, the alleged miscalculations occurred between the time lenders sought court authorization to sell a property and when that motion was officially granted.
According to the filings, the practice systematically increased the payoff amount owed by borrowers, diverting surplus funds that should have gone back to homeowners following foreclosure sales.
“Countless mortgage holders were deprived of surplus funds as a result of the collective failures by foreclosing banks, loan servicing agents and their attorneys,” said Mark Anderson, a partner at Anderson, Bowman, Wallshein, the firm leading the litigation.
The list of defendants includes major financial institutions and mortgage service providers, among them Fannie Mae, Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Mr. Cooper Group Inc., and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing.
The State of New York Mortgage Agency, known for providing low-interest loans to first-time buyers, was also named in the lawsuits, as were several law firms and MTGLQ Investors LP, an entity owned by Goldman Sachs that specializes in distressed loan acquisitions.
The lawsuits draw comparisons to misconduct exposed during the 2008 financial crisis, when lenders and servicers paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle claims related to improper foreclosure handling.
In one case detailed in the filings, Sheila Bidar, the legal guardian of her 89-year-old mother Ruth Athill, is serving as a class representative. Bidar alleges that the loan servicer, Select Portfolio Servicing Inc., and other parties involved charged an extra $13,300 in interest due to improper calculations.
The case also claims that Athill’s home, foreclosed and auctioned in May 2023, was initially bid on for $785,000, but the bid was ultimately reassigned to Deutsche Bank, her lender. The property later sold for just $207,071, according to court documents. With an outstanding mortgage balance of $167,773, the drop in the sale price combined with the inflated interest amounted to a $591,000 shortfall, according to the complaint.
“She’s lost out on so much. It’s really heartbreaking,” Bidar told reporters.

Defendants responded with mixed comments. A Deutsche Bank spokesperson said the bank acted solely as a trustee on the residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) and was not involved in day-to-day servicing.
“Loan-level matters, including foreclosure actions and subsequent purchases or sales of properties, are handled exclusively by mortgage loan servicers,” the Deutsche spokesperson said.
A representative for Bank of New York Mellon made a similar statement, claiming it held no responsibility for the foreclosure process. Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing, Goldman Sachs, and the law firm Eckert Seamans declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. Several other defendants have yet to issue statements.

The financial institution has designed a platform that bridges digital and traditional assets. BNY’s initial focus is on using the power of blockchain and asset tokenization technology to drive operational efficiency, mobility of assets, transparency and real-time access to data.
BNY’s platform will integrate off-chain and on-chain data to streamline reporting, monitoring, and servicing capabilities across blockchains.
Last September, Bloomberg reported how BNY is moving closer to rolling out custody services for the bitcoin and ETH held in Exchange Traded Products or ETPs. At the time the SEC’s SAB 121 was still in place. The SAB 121 rule had forced banks to classify crypto as liabilities.
BNY has been developing digital assets custody services since before October 2022, but only now, with the SAB 121 rule removed, can financial institutions act for their clients.
BlackRock Chooses BNY’s New Blockchain Accounting Tool
Larry Fink was bullish about digital assets in his annual letter this week. He compared the SWIFT payment system to the postal service, and tokenization to how email has disrupted sending letters in the post.
“Every stock, every bond, every fund – every asset – can be tokenized. If they are. It will revolutionize investing.” Fink stated in the report. He is championing tokenization having watched the BlackRock Bitcoin ETP do so well since it was launched.
Shortly after Fink’s letter was made public, Fortune broke a story about BNY’s announcement of its latest crypto offering.
BNY’s new tool provides up-to-date data about a fund’s net asset value, directly on a blockchain. BNY’s Head of Digital Assets, Caroline Butler, told Fortune that “because we have expertise in blockchain, other fund accountants in the industry would struggle to do this.”
BlackRock is reported to be the first client for BNY’s new platform. Robert Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets confirmed the story in a statement to Fortune.
