BNY spent the week engaging with clients and policymakers and came away believing that businesses and governments are settling in for a longer period of heightened uncertainty. Within an evolving geopolitical, economic and market environment, three key themes were consistent across our conversations.
1. The Pursuit of Growth is Universal, but Increasingly Regional
At the beginning of the year, our experts wrote about the megatrends driving the growth outlook and how each are changing economies, both advanced and emerging. The world has shifted significantly since, but across jurisdictions the focus remains on pursuing policies that boost growth. That pursuit is taking place within the context of changes in trade routes, monetary and fiscal policies, regulatory approaches, industrial support and the impact of AI and blockchain.
In response, public and private sector leaders are looking to boost domestic sources of growth while reshoring, or “friendshoring,” industries to protect against an uncertain global landscape. In the first four months of the year, home bias is apparent. Japanese investors are buying JGBs over U.S. Bonds. EU investors are buying German Bunds. The consequence of increased volatility since March has shifted risk and reward ratios making EUR and JPY compete with the USD as safe havens. U.S. asset selling has been notable since the start of the year and doesn’t look done yet, despite the relief rally in bonds and stocks in April. We expect more regionalization moving forward, but we also expect global investment flows to remain an important component of the growth story.
2. Adaptability Matters
For countries and businesses large and small, navigating this evolving landscape will require adaptability. What came through in our conversations last week was the importance of dynamic budgeting, scenario planning and risk management. During periods of heightened uncertainty and volatility, it is critical to be prepared for all outcomes, particularly as global economic and geopolitical shocks become more of the norm and less so outlier events.
On the global stage, some countries have already quickly recognized their new reality and moved to secure opportunities that elevate their own geopolitical standing, boost economic growth and drive prosperity.
Business leaders face similar risk and reward moments, particularly as innovative technologies — such as AI and blockchain — look to fundamentally change how we live and work. Positioning a business — its balance sheet, operational structure and global footprint and its employees — to remain flexible and adjust quickly to evolving geopolitical, economic and market developments is now table stakes. Failing to do so will leave businesses caught flat-footed and unable to meet their growth potential.
3. 'Opting Out' is Not an Option
Operating in this new environment also means that “opting out” of change is not an option. Every day at BNY, we see our clients around the world who are increasingly adopting pragmatism, new operating models and partnerships with each other. They are doing this to increase their own resilience, to scale and to achieve profitability in the world as it exists now, not the way they wish it to be.
That sentiment has now permeated the public sector. Across our conversations last week, officials recognize that maintaining the status quo is impossible. Change is necessary, expected by their constituencies and needs to move at pace. A good case study is what has transpired in Europe over the first four months of this year: simplifying regulation, boosting market connectivity and driving further investment into economies. Many of these changes will take time to materialize in the data, but we see the appetite for change having a durable impact on business and the public sector for the foreseeable future."

While BlackRock has leaned into tokenization with its BUIDL tokenized treasury fund issued on permissionless blockchains via Securitize, the target market (for now) is primarily crypto institutions. Stablecoin and tokenized money market fund (MMF) issuers are the primary BUIDL token holders.
By contrast, BNY Mellon primarily services mainstream traditional finance (TradFI) institutions as the world’s largest global custodian and a major tri-party agent.

- The news comes as banks across Wall Street pull bankers back to the office full time.
- Business Insider obtained the memo, which said the bank has no plans for fully in-office work.
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., known for helping financial clients clear and custody securities, is the latest bank to rein in remote work. In a memo to staff, the firm's executive committee announced that it was asking employees to return to the office four days a week.
The memo, a copy of which was obtained by BI, said the new requirement would take place starting September 2, 2025, the day after Labor Day. The firm, commonly known as BNY, has required its workers to be in the office three days a week since 2023. Managers were called back to the office four days a week earlier this year.
The switch comes as companies from Amazon to AT&T start asking workers to return to pre-pandemic norms. Similar efforts are unfolding across Wall Street: JPMorgan Chase called its workers back to the office five days a week earlier this year, prompting some workers to explore unionization efforts or look for new jobs.
The memo from BNY's executive committee focuses on the importance of community and culture, which requires that employees spend more time together in the office.
It also emphasized the importance of ""personal flexibility.""
Indeed, BNY told its 51,000-plus employees it has ""no plans"" to require five days a week. It said employees will also continue to have the flexibility to work two weeks a year from anywhere, a perk the bank has dubbed ""work from anywhere.""
The bank, which also offers wealth management and investment advice, had previously instituted a 2-week ""recharge period"" around the end of each year, which allows employees to work remotely and skip non-essential activities, like internal meetings.
See the memo below:
As we continue to place even more emphasis on our community and culture, we believe that it is important that all of us spend more time together working, leading and learning from each other. As a result, we have decided that it is appropriate to ask all employees* to return to the office 4 days a week by September 2, 2025.
As a leadership team, we're committed to maintaining personal flexibility, and will continue to support remote work one day a week. We have no plans to return to 5 days in office unless circumstances were to demand otherwise.
We also want to remind everyone that we provide a ""work from anywhere"" benefit and a range of other benefits to help colleagues care for their mental and physical health and wellbeing.
This step is also facilitated by the continued investments our firm is making in our offices and workspaces to deliver a modern, world-class in-office experience to our employees.
Being in the office together helps us collaborate and move work forward more efficiently. Occasional remote work can be effective, but in person we can respond more quickly to dynamic, fast-paced financial markets and better serve our clients. Most managers are already in the office 4 days a week, and we have seen the positive momentum this creates.
While we expect all employees to return to the office 4 days a week by September 2 at the latest, our offices are already open to you to come in as frequently as you'd like.
One BNY is more than an idea or a concept — it's a culture, and culture is made up of people. Which means all of us. Thank you for your commitment to our clients, our company and our community, and to this next step on our journey to Thrive Together.
The Executive Committee"

BlackRock filed to tokenize its $150bn Treasury Trust money-market fund with a new “DLT Shares” class.
BNY Mellon will keep a blockchain mirror of every share on-chain.
Biggest real-world asset flow to Ethereum yet.
BlackRock also previously launched their BUIDL fund on Ethereum, which right now manages around $2.34 billion in assets. This new Ethereum-BlackRock deal kind of builds on their existing experience with institutional blockchain adoption.
Ethereum’s Position as Industry Standard
Ethereum currently has a pretty strong dominance in real-world asset tokenization with about 56% market share and approximately $6.2 billion in tokenized assets. This deal really reinforces this position even further.
Onchain Foundation head of research Leon Waidmann said:
“Institutions follow deep liquidity, credible neutrality, and battle-tested security. ETH is already their settlement layer.”
The Ethereum tokenization process seems to be becoming more and more attractive to major financial institutions that are looking for better efficiency and transparency in their operations.

BlackRock’s Vision for Blockchain Finance
BlackRock’s crypto investment strategy appears to be accelerating quite a bit lately. The firm’s leadership has made some pretty clear statements about their support for blockchain technology and its potential.
BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said:
“Tokenization will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.”
This Ethereum-BlackRock deal represents a significant step toward this vision of transformed financial markets with faster settlement times and more efficient capital use.
ETH Price Performance Despite Institutional Interest
Even with all the excitement around the Ethereum-BlackRock deal, ETH prices are still kind of subdued, hovering around $1,800 and down about 63% from those 2021 peaks we saw. The Ethereum market volatility continues to be a factor despite these positive institutional developments we’re seeing.
Interestingly enough, BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF has still accumulated approximately $162 million worth of Ether over just four trading days, which shows some institutional confidence despite the current Ethereum market volatility that we’re experiencing.

BlackRock Advances Toward Blockchain for Money Market Fund Shares
BlackRock has filed to issue digital shares for one of its well-known money market funds. These shares are anticipated to reflect the performance of the BlackRock Liquidity Funds Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX). They will employ blockchain to provide an additional level of transparency regarding the ownership of the shares.
The news, in an SEC filing published today, could signal a significant shift from traditional asset management models regarding the use of blockchain in financial services. The shares themselves won’t be tokenized, but blockchain will be employed to mirror ownership records in the interest of verification, giving investors a transparent way to verify ownership.
How BlackRock Works to Use Blockchain in Its Digital Shares
The digital shares will be backed by BlackRock’s Treasury Fund, primarily investing in U.S. Treasury bills and cash, worth over $150 million. The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) will use blockchain technology to maintain a “mirror record” of share ownership. The blockchain will maintain an updated ledger of share ownership for verification purposes, but it won’t function as the primary, legally binding ownership record.
Institutional Investment Requirements for BlackRock’s DLT Shares
The barrier to entry for institutional investors seeking to purchase these digital shares is enormous. The DLT shares can only be acquired with a minimum of $3m and the trades will only be done on transactions that pass through BNY Mellon. The exclusivity underscores the product’s strategic, large-scale focus, targeting institutional investors rather than retail ones.
Although the filing doesn’t peg details on a ticker or management fee for the digital shares, the filing foregrounds the potential for blockchain to further leak into mainstream aspects of finance. The filing is aligned with similar moves by other large finance industry players, like Fidelity, which recently filed for an Ethereum-based share class that could represent their own U.S. Treasury fund.
BlackRock and the Growing Market for Treasury Tokenization
Filing as a longer-term trend in finance: experimentation with blockchain to allow tokenized versions of things like treasury bills and other traditional financial instruments. Already, the treasury tokenization market is more than $6 billion in value, with BlackRock’s BUIDL boasting more than $2.55 billion in assets.
The Regulatory Setting and Its Potential Impact on BlackRock and the Industry
The BlackRock filing comes on the heels of a similar effort by Fidelity, which recently filed for an Ethereum-based OnChain share class. Though Fidelity’s filing remains subject to a regulator’s blessing, the interest in blockchain and financial service is clear. If these filings are granted, it could be an indication that blockchain is being increasingly embraced at traditional financial markets.
The BlackRock’s shift is also a product of the company’s strategic place in a shifting market.
