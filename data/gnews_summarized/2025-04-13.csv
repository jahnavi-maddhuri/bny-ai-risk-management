The breach, detected in mid-February but impacting over 100 accounts for more than a year, is deemed a “major incident” by the OCC and the U.S. Treasury. The compromised emails may contain highly sensitive data provided by banks, including details on their financial health, cybersecurity protections, vulnerability assessments, and even the content of National Security Letters. These letters often involve confidential information related to terrorism and espionage investigations.
According to Bloomberg, the banks’ decision to limit information sharing stems from concerns about potential security risks to their own computer networks in the wake of the OCC breach. Representatives for JPMorgan and BNY declined to comment. A spokesperson for the OCC told the network that the agency is working with third-party cybersecurity experts to review the hack and its IT security policies and is keeping supervised institutions informed. The OCC also affirmed that onsite examiners retain necessary access to bank information.
Citigroup, operating under a tighter OCC consent order, has reportedly not limited its information sharing. It remains unclear if other major banks like Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs have taken similar actions as JPMorgan and BNY.
Bloomberg’s sources indicate that some banks were unaware of the breach’s full extent until recent reporting, raising questions about the OCC’s initial response and security measures. The OCC is still working to determine the exact scope of the data compromised and whether affected banks need to be notified.
The incident has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. House Financial Services Committee and the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, which are seeking more information from the OCC. David P. Weber, a former OCC enforcement counsel, described the banks’ actions as a “historic” challenge to the regulator’s authority, signaling a “fundamental breakdown of the examination authority of the OCC.”

Experts quoted in the Bloomberg report warn that the compromised material could be used for targeted cyberattacks or extortion against banks. The breach highlights the cybersecurity risks within the financial sector and has eroded trust between banks and their regulator. The OCC has disclosed some affected staff accounts to the banks but has not yet detailed the types of data stolen, including cybersecurity-related information."

Providing Asiaâs EAMs With Heavy-Hitting Support â BNY Pershing
In this continuing series, we talk to BNY Pershing about the work it does with EAMs in Singapore and other financial centres in the region.Â
This news service is continuing to track how banks and other financial services firms serve Asiaâs external asset managers, with a particular focus on Singapore, but also other centres such as Hong Kong. (See previous articles here, here, here and here.)
These articles come ahead of our scheduled WealthBriefingAsia EAM Awards 2025, taking place on 16 October, in Singapore. Nominations for entries are open.
In this article, we talked to the
firm about what it does and its views about the
sector.
Please explain your EAM offering
BNY Pershing
offers a wealth services platform to external asset managers and
advisory firms across the region. This platform provides a range
of services including execution and custody, which allows them to
provide access to their clients to a number of financial assets
and markets, helping them help more people.
BNY Pershing has a number of longstanding client relationships across the region, doing business for more than 20 years. We also support a number of innovative firms globally. (BNY Pershing gave the case of its support for US-headquartered Arta Wealth Managementâs public launch in Singapore, in October 2024. Arta uses Pershing to support its clients across both its US and international client base.)
How important is the EAM business line to the firm in
general, for example, for revenue growth, etc?
BNY Pershing is seeing significant growth both internationally
and within Asia Pacific and we expect this to continue to benefit
the industry and our business.
When dealing with EAMs, what are the main tasks and forms
of support they ask for the most and why, in your
experience?
Most queries are product-based in nature, inquiring about
different assets and markets available via the platform
(structured, alternatives, funds, fixed income or traditional
equities) or different reporting and analytical capabilities. BNY
Pershing has a professional and an investor portal, the latter
which can be white labelled and offered directly to the advisorsâ
UHNW clients.
How important has the rise of Singapore-based Variable
Capital Companies (VCCs) been in driving what EAMs
do?
Weâve certainly seen the rise of VCCs in driving what EAMs do,
attracting Southeast Asian investorsâ capital â particularly
the HNW/UHNW segment. For BNY, VCCs focused on alternative
investments have been an important area within BNYâs Asset
Servicing Business, where we can provide a full suite of fund
administration and custody solutions today.
Interestingly over the last nine to 12 months weâve also seen a shift in VCC interest from regional EAMs to global EAMs targeting Southeast Asian-based investor capital, using VCCs for access funds. More broadly we see the rise of VCCs as a driver of change and innovation in the funds industry across the region, from the launch of the Hong Kong LP structure to some of the recent announcements from the [Hong Kong] Securities and Futures Commission relating to alternative Hong Kong OFCs [open-ended fund companies], amongst others.
Regulatory issues remain important, and Singapore is of
course no exception, along with Southeast Asia more generally.
Are there topics that are particularly front of mind at the
moment?
Weâve certainly seen an increased focus on resiliency, client
asset safety, and transparency over the years. Resiliency is core
to our commercial business model, and our EAM clients benefit
from the same resiliency being used to service most of the
largest institutions in the world.
We have heavily invested in our core technology stack, modernising our infrastructure, and deploying active data centres. We are also market leading in leveraging AI/ML tools with one practical example being anomaly detection in our transaction and messaging flows. At times, this has allowed us to identify and escalate infrastructure issues or cybersecurity threats originating from outside of our organisation directly to our clients allowing them to mitigate the impact.
We also see that several markets are actively encouraging diversification and globalising their investments to increase retirement income and returns, in part to combat ageing populations. This includes a move to self-directed portfolios with a greater penetration and reliance on financial advice.
How is digital technology shaping the sort of custody
services you provide, for example affecting its cost, range of
service, etc?
Depth, quality, and sophistication of product capabilities is
increasingly important, and a unique competitive advantage across
the BNY group which includes the largest global custodian, the
largest agent lender, the largest US clearing broker dealer, and
access to a wide range of assets.
We provide our clients with unique access to this ability to scale, innovate, and deliver to their client base. One example specific to EAMs and wealth management is the additional portfolio yield that can be generated by participating in a fully-paid securities lending programme. We provide EAMs with direct visibility on the potential revenue that a clientâs asset portfolio could yield if they participated in securities lending so that they can drive meaningful client conversations.
Another example might be our algorithm [algo]-based fixed income portfolio construction, optimisation, and trading solution â BondWise. It helps advisors construct and optimise client portfolios while aggregating liquidity.
Finally, a last example might be our âMoney in Motionâ analytics screen which allows advisors to monitor and identify client asset flows quickly across their client base. Not all products and services are offered in all countries."

The new feature will enable eToro users based in the UK and Europe to earn passive income by lending out their stocks.
While BNY will act as the custodian, the companies will work with stock lending platform EquiLend to identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
Eligible eToro users will be given the option to opt into the programme, with their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending.
Once opted in, eToro said users will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earn in the specified period.
Only whole unit stock positions are eligible for lending and eToro said that fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.
The company added that stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
Users who lend their stock temporarily give ownership of the stocks to the borrower and lose voting rights while the stock is on loan. However, eToro said they can still receive dividends, sell the stocks or opt out of the programme at any time at no cost.
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+ and Diamond Club members, with this followed at a later date by lower-tier Club members.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way, yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets,” said Yossi Brandes, VP execution services at eToro. “Leveraging BNY’s Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,”

The building has been smashed and covered with paint
A city centre office block has been taped off after being targeted by vandals overnight.
Police are outside The Observatory, on Chapel Walks, this morning (April 14) after the building was smashed up and daubed in red paint.
The office is the Manchester base for the Aviva insurance company.
No-one has claimed responsibility for the incident so far, which is being investigated by Greater Manchester Police as criminal damage.
However, it comes almost five weeks after pro-Palestine protesters scaled the building on March 11.
Images from the scene show forensics investigators gathering evidence outside the building.
Glass windows and doors have been smashed, while red paint covers a large area of the building.
The damage appears similar to previous pro-Palestine protests in Manchester used against businesses such as Barclays and BNY Mellon.
A GMP spokesperson said: ""Officers are investigating following reports of criminal damage to a premises on Chapel Walks, Manchester.
""Enquiries are currently ongoing and anyone with any information is asked to contact police.""
Aviva has condemned the incident and vowed to take legal action.
A spokesperson for the company said: ""We have had some disruption at our Manchester office this morning (Monday, April 14).
""Our first priority is to ensure the safety of our people.
""We will not tolerate any criminal behaviour towards our people or property and will take appropriate legal action.
""This has not impacted our service to customers."""
