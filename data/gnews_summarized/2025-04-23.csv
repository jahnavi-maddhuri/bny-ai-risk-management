Cullen had just helped close the market, marking the firm’s milestone of surpassing C$3 trillion in assets under administration (AUA). For the CEO who took the helm barely two years ago, the moment was more than ceremonial. “I’m incredibly proud,” said Cullen, noting that reaching the C$3 trillion mark reflects “the trust our clients place in us and the hard work of our talented team”.
Cullen’s praise for the work of the nearly 2,000-strong team stretched to every employee who had contributed to the success over nearly three decades whether through solidifying, onboarding, or supporting the business during its history.
“This achievement isn’t just about the number,” he continued. “It’s about delivering meaningful progress… and continuing to innovate for our clients.” In other words, crossing the $3 trillion threshold is not a finish line, but a springboard for CIBC Mellon’s next evolution.
Spurring further innovation
Hitting C$3 trillion in AUA places CIBC Mellon in rarefied air. It ranks the Toronto-based custodian among a select group of global asset servicing firms that have ever reached such scale, reinforcing the firm’s role as a trusted provider in the industry.
The joint venture – co-owned by two powerhouses – administers assets on behalf of Canada’s largest banks, insurance companies, pension plans, investment funds, corporations and other institutional investors.
The growth has been striking. As at 31 December 2024, CIBC Mellon’s administered assets were roughly double the level from just a few years prior.

Hitting C$3 trillion in AUA places CIBC Mellon in rarefied air. It ranks the Toronto-based custodian among a select group of global asset servicing firms that have ever reached such scale, reinforcing the firm’s role as a trusted provider in the industry.
The joint venture – co-owned by two powerhouses – administers assets on behalf of Canada’s largest banks, insurance companies, pension plans, investment funds, corporations and other institutional investors.
The growth has been striking. As at 31 December 2024, CIBC Mellon’s administered assets were roughly double the level from just a few years prior.
Cullen attributes this climb to strong client relationships and operational resilience. “It’s a significant milestone that reflects our clients’ confidence in us,” he explains to Global Custodian. “We have a relentless focus on making sure that the clients know that we are looking out for Canadian requirements. We’re advocating for regulatory changes and we’re supporting what is somewhat unique in the Canadian market.”
Beyond the sheer number, Cullen sees symbolic weight in the milestone. It coincides with a period of stability and expansion for the firm. CIBC Mellon was founded in 1996 as a 50-50 joint venture between Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and The Bank of New York Mellon – now known more succinctly as BNY. The unique parentage has always been a key to CIBC Mellon’s success – and never more so than now, as global investors increasingly seek both local insight and international reach.
With the support of BNY, CIBC Mellon has steadily broadened its service offerings. The firm has long provided custody, fund administration, pension benefit services and unitholder recordkeeping, as well as enabling access to parent company services such as foreign exchange and securities lending.
In more recent years, the CIBC Mellon has launched and grown capabilities in emerging areas like digital and data services, helped launch the world’s first bitcoin and ether ETFs in Canada, advanced into the insurance business and inked alliances with a growing array of fintechs to improve its efficiency and offerings.
The milestone places CIBC Mellon ahead as the largest Canadian custodian and also validates the company’s strategy of running the business better and innovating for clients. For CIBC Mellon, scale has come hand-in-hand with trust – and with pressure to keep raising the bar.
Global scale, local expertise
Global scale, local expertise
Cullen is the first to highlight the advantage of CIBC Mellon’s parentage. “Our unique position as a Canadian leader backed by the global strength of BNY allows us to offer our clients a combination of local expertise and global capabilities,” he explains.
In practice, this means clients benefit from a massive global network – BNY’s custody platform spans over $52 trillion in assets worldwide – while dealing with a team on the ground in Canada that understands the local market and regulatory landscape.
It’s a balance of big and small, global and local. Cullen often describes CIBC Mellon as the Canadian arm of BNY’s global asset servicing network, with deep roots and client relationships in Canada thanks to CIBC.
This dual identity enables the firm to tap into cutting-edge technologies, risk management practices and product capabilities from its multinational parents, then tailor them to Canadian client needs.
He points to the firm’s culture of focus on client service, innovative technology and operational excellence – a culture reinforced by both parent organisations.
Innovation in operations
Innovation in operations
Perhaps the most dramatic change Cullen has witnessed in asset servicing is the rise of automation and data analytics in what was once a manual, paper-driven business.
“Innovation in the custody space is largely driven by rapid advancements in technology and the growing power of data analytics,” he says. “At CIBC Mellon, teams are witnessing transformative progress in areas such as automation and artificial intelligence, which are revolutionising how transactions are managed and processed allowing for greater efficiency, accuracy and speed in daily operations.”
Subsequently, mundane back-office tasks that might have taken hours of human effort can now be completed in seconds with the right algorithms. Cullen notes that the firm is actively investing in cutting-edge technologies to streamline processes and deliver real-time insights to clients. The goal is to shift staff away from repetitive workload and toward higher-value analysis and client service.
One recent example is CIBC Mellon and BNY’s launch of the first integrated investment operations solution for a Canadian insurance company. “This solution represents a comprehensive service model, including the first outsourced general insurance fund accounting solution in Canada,” says Cullen.
He stresses that innovation isn’t pursued for its own sake, but to add tangible value: “Our commitment to continuous improvement, agility and staying ahead of industry trends enables us to provide exceptional value and maintain our competitive edge,” he says.
The future of asset servicing
The future of asset servicing
Looking ahead, Cullen expects the asset servicing landscape to continue shifting – and perhaps at an even faster pace. “The industry is poised for significant transformation in the coming years,” he predicts.
On the horizon are new technologies like digital assets and blockchain, which “will revolutionise the way securities are issued, traded and settled,” according to Cullen.
Today’s custodians may soon find themselves safekeeping tokenised stocks or bonds, not just paper certificates or electronic records. At the same time, clients and regulators are demanding greater transparency, security and real-time processing in every transaction. This is pushing firms to upgrade systems and rethink old processes.
Regulation, too, remains a wild card. From evolving accounting rules to heightened cybersecurity requirements, asset servicers will need robust, flexible infrastructures to keep up.
“At CIBC Mellon, we are committed to staying at the forefront of these changes,” he says, ensuring the firm continues to provide clients with cutting-edge solutions and services whatever the future may hold.
Part of that readiness comes from drawing on its shareholders’ strengths – whether it’s CIBC’s deep knowledge of Canadian banking or BNY’s investments in global fintech and risk management.
If the past few years have proven anything, it’s that adaptation is essential. Cullen admits that one of his constant concerns is cybersecurity, given the rising sophistication of cyber threats. But here again, he draws confidence from preparation: “Our cybersecurity strategy benefits from the considerable focus, investment and resources of CIBC in Canada and BNY globally, ensuring we are well positioned to protect our clients,” he notes.
From his vantage point, the future of asset servicing will be defined by those who can blend scale with agility. As Mal Cullen guides CIBC Mellon beyond the $3 trillion milestone, he is effectively balancing two imperatives: safeguarding the trust it took decades to earn, and reinventing the business to meet the demands of the next decade. It’s a juggling act he embraces.
After all, as Cullen puts it, relentless adaptation is part of the job description when you’re a “leader in asset servicing.” And if CIBC Mellon’s trajectory is any indication, the company is well on its way to defining what asset servicing will look like in the years ahead – global yet local, efficient yet innovative, and always prepared for what’s next."

Just after dawn in London, a tier‑one bank’s treasury bot scans the liquidity position, matches it to day‑ahead cash‑flow forecasts and silently sweeps £210 million from a low‑yield reserve account into the overnight repo market. A risk notice and rationale land in the human treasurer’s inbox minutes later, but the decision, trade execution and journal entry were all performed end‑to‑end by software. Similar scenes are playing out in credit‑card pricing teams in Singapore and fraud‑monitoring squads in New York. The common actor behind them is agentic AI: autonomous, goal‑seeking systems that perceive, reason, act and, crucially, learn inside production environments.
Only eighteen months ago the conversation was still about prompt engineering. Today, the frontier has shifted to whether banks can allow software “colleagues” to run unsupervised for minutes, hours or even days. The answer is already a tentative yes, and the implications, commercial, operational and regulatory, are profound.
From generative to agentic: adding the feedback loop
Generative AI dazzled executives by spinning up text, code and images; yet it still required a human hand on the prompt. Agentic AI bolts a continuous feedback loop onto that capacity. The agent ingests streaming data, evaluates it against a set of objectives and constraints, decides on an action, executes the action via APIs or internal systems and then watches the outcome to refine its future policy. The World Economic Forum has described this closed‑loop autonomy as finance’s next step toward “process self‑governance.” It is not artificial general intelligence as each agent is still narrow, but when hundreds operate in concert, the functional perimeter of the firm begins to change.
Why finance?
Financial services deliver the very things agentic systems feed on: dense, structured data; repeatable, rule‑bound workflows; and markets that punish latency. The industry also suffers from margin compression: cost‑to‑income ratios at many global banks still sit uncomfortably above 50 percent, which makes even small efficiency gains valuable. Finally, customers transact around the clock. A human trader may pause for sleep; an agent never does.
Those conditions explain why banks, asset managers and insurers have become early laboratories. The work rarely makes front‑page news, but internal programme names: Quest IndexGPT, Eliza, GPT Store, are already part of everyday Slack chatter in the institutions that run them.
Quest IndexGPT: a data scientist that never clocks out
J.P. Morgan’s asset‑management arm went live with IndexGPT in May 2024. The tool asks an LLM to generate keywords around an investment theme, for example, “circular economy” or “quantum‑safe cybersecurity,” then pipes the list into a separate NLP engine that trawls filings and news, scores corporate exposure and re‑balances a real index. Human portfolio managers still sign‑off, but the cognitive lift has shifted to silicon. The bank touts faster time‑to‑market for bespoke thematic baskets and lower running costs for small, long‑tail indices that would have been uneconomic under a fully human process.
BBVA’s GPT Store: autonomy through crowdsourcing
Spain’s BBVA took a different route. In late 2024 it rolled out an internal GPT Store where any employee could publish an approved agent and any colleague could reuse it. Within four months the store held roughly 3,000 micro‑agents handling tasks from legal‑query triage to sentiment analysis of call‑centre transcripts. Licence utilisation among the initial user base exceeded 80 percent, a figure that astonished even the bank’s AI leadership team. The lesson: once knowledge‑workers taste autonomy at the task level, adoption can snowball without top‑down mandates.
BNY Mellon’s Project Eliza: custodianship meets ChatGPT
February 2025 brought another milestone when custody giant BNY Mellon announced a partnership with OpenAI to co‑develop Eliza, a proprietary agentic platform set to underpin every product line from securities services to payments. BNY’s chief information officer framed the move bluntly: “We no longer think of AI as a bolt‑on. It is the operating system of the bank.” The firm’s roadmap calls for thousands of self‑service agents, each governed by a central risk office but deployed and iterated by business users.
2025: the “year of the agent”
If these early adopters feel niche, consider the macro trend. Executives polled at the Reuters NEXT summit predict that autonomous agents will dominate the AI agenda in 2025, shifting boardroom metrics from top‑line growth to margin expansion as tasks that once consumed hours of analyst labour collapse to seconds of compute. Venture capital is shifting likewise: deal memos now obsess over agent‑centric architectures rather than foundation‑model bragging rights.
Goldman Sachs analysts go further. In a March 2025 note they argue that tomorrow’s infrastructure super‑cycle, billions in cloud capex, “hinges on AI agents” able to keep data‑centre utilisation above 90 percent and dynamically arbitrage compute across regions. In other words, the financial logic of the cloud itself may soon depend on autonomous software rulers.
Regulators step onto the pitch
Supervisors are anything but idle observers. Singapore’s Monetary Authority (MAS) completed a thematic review of AI model‑risk controls in mid‑2024 and published a 28‑page information paper outlining expectations for generative and agentic systems, from data‑lineage tracking to kill‑switch design. A follow‑up circular on cyber‑risks highlighted the prospect of “malicious prompt injection” that could redirect an agent’s objectives without breaching the underlying model, an attack vector far subtler than SQL injection yet potentially as damaging.
Across the Channel, the EU’s AI Act put financial applications into its “high‑risk” tier, demanding technical documentation, human oversight and post‑market monitoring. Critics warn the Act’s product‑safety framing will age badly as agents evolve, but for now compliance officers must treat every credit‑scoring or robo‑advice agent as though it were a medical device. The Bank of England’s latest industry survey puts data protection, model explainability and talent shortages at the top of banks’ AI pain points, a hierarchy that neatly mirrors the MAS findings.
Governance moves from slides to source‑code
For years “human‑in‑the‑loop” was the comfort blanket of AI risk frameworks; agents force a harder conversation. The emerging consensus looks like this: the board sets an agent charter linked to enterprise risk appetite; a central AI risk unit validates models, red‑teams behaviours and signs off on every new objective function; immutable logs feed a real‑time dashboard monitored by operations staff authorised to pull the plug. Crucially, the fail‑safe is coded as a circuit‑breaker on specific metrics, market‑value‑at‑risk spikes, unexplained model drift, rather than a generic panic button. MAS explicitly endorses such role‑based, telemetry‑driven controls in its guidance.
Talent wars: less data scientist, more AI ops engineer
Autonomy also rewrites job descriptions. BBVA doubled its dedicated AI headcount to more than 400 in 2024 and opened “AI Factories” in Mexico and Turkey. The fastest‑growing title in this space is neither quant nor prompt engineer but “AI operations officer” professionals fluent in Basel III liquidity ratios as well as retrieval‑augmented generation pipelines. These hybrid operatives babysit swarms of agents, write policy tests and negotiate with regulators. Banks that fail to cultivate such talent risk strangling innovation in second‑line approvals; those that succeed gain an engine of perpetual experimentation.
Competitive lines are redrawn
Who is best placed to own the agentic future? The card schemes start with global authentication rails and data on billions of transactions; add decision autonomy and they could morph into de‑facto credit‑decision utilities. Hyperscalers control the foundation‑model stack and sell agent orchestration as a service; the danger for banks is dependency on computational landlords with competing retail ambitions. Incumbent banks retain the balance‑sheet licences and decades of labelled data, but they must move fast, often by taking equity stakes in start‑ups that supply agentic middleware.
The Path Ahead
By year‑end 2025, analysts expect agentic AI to run perhaps five percent of intraday liquidity buffers at global systemically important banks. The first supervisory stress‑tests that explicitly model agent failure channels are penciled in for 2026. And by 2027, at least one advanced economy may permit autonomous underwriting for retail loans, matched by a new “algorithmic accountability” statute somewhere in Asia. Whether these dates slip or accelerate, the trajectory points in only one direction: deeper machine agency over the financial stack.
“Trust, but verify”
Agentic AI is not just another incremental efficiency play; it is a delegation of decision rights that strikes at the orthodox structure of a bank. The upside is extraordinary: 24‑hour trading desks that never tire, personalised offers generated, and risk‑priced, in real time, operating ratios that finally look more like fintech than legacy finance. The downside, should governance fail, is systemic: black‑box trades, cascading model drift, concentration risk in a handful of foundation models.
The pragmatic path is already visible in the institutions leading the charge: small, revenue‑bearing pilots like IndexGPT; crowd‑sourced innovation sandboxes like BBVA’s GPT Store; platform‑level commitments like BNY’s Eliza; and regulator‑aligned guard‑rails that make every agent auditable by design. Banks that treat agents as genuine colleagues, complete with job descriptions, performance reviews and the occasional disciplinary memo, will convert the promise of autonomy into sustainable competitive advantage. Those that do not will discover, perhaps abruptly, that trust without verification is simply abdication.
Either way, when the markets open tomorrow morning, an invisible software co‑worker will already have taken the first trade. It is time the rest of us caught up."
