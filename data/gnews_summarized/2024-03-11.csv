Safety concerns prompt flyers to change their flights.
Airplane manufacturing giant Boeing is going viral this week for all the wrong reasons.
The company's fleet of commercial airplanes has been rife with safety issues, prompting widespread media attention and mounting concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and flyers. Here's what you need to know.
What is going on with Boeing planes, and what does John Oliver have to do with it?
It's been a turbulent few weeks for Boeing planes, as several aircraft have experienced alarming issues mid-flight — we'll get into that later — but the company started getting a lot of heat for its insufficient safety protocols after John Oliver's Last Week Tonight did a brilliant and damning segment on it last week.
You May Also Like
We've embedded the entire video, which is worth a watch. But the TL;DR of the commentary from Oliver: Boeing's company culture shifted away from safety and quality to increasing shareholder value, which resulted in, well, plummeting safety and quality.
Oliver goes through the history of the company in depth, providing context for the recent safety issues. It's all fitting and in line with the reporting in 2018 and 2019 after two Boeing 737 Max crashes killed 346 people.
What's happening now with Boeing?
In short: a few things, none of them good. The New York Times reported that the FAA examined Boeing and found it failed 33 of 89 audits after a high-profile incident where a panel blew off a 737 Max 9 flight before reaching cruising altitude.
You've most likely seen footage of that terrifying incident where, by some miracle, everyone survived.
The Times goes into a bit of detail on these issues, but the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a quality-improvement plan.
The latest Boeing safety incidents
Fortunately, there haven't been fatal incidents in the past few weeks, but Boeing planes have experienced significant safety issues. Fifty people were injured on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner that took a nosedive flying from Sydney, Australia to Auckland, New Zealand on Monday.
Passenger Brian Jokat told CNN that the pilot said they lost control of the plane, causing the incident.
""I immediately engaged with him and said, 'What was that?' And he openly admitted, he said, 'I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me,'"" Jokat told CNN.
There have been a few other recent instances as well, including a Boeing 777-200 that had a tire fall off shortly after takeoff in San Francisco on Thursday. The flight was re-routed to Los Angeles and landed without any injuries. A Boeing plane landing in Houston on Friday ran off the runway into a grassy area. Last week, a Boeing 737-900's engine caught fire some 20 minutes after takeoff, and videos of the incident, naturally, went viral.
This could be more folks noticing common relative incidents because Boeing is in the news already, but the fact remains there have been numerous incidents as of late.
Boeing whistleblower John Barnett found dead
John Barnett — a longtime Boeing employee who had been providing evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company — was found dead on Monday. The Charleston County coroner said the death was from a ""self-inflicted"" wound, the BBC reported.
Barnett, who had worked as a quality manager, had alleged that Boeing put workers under intense pressure which led to compromised safety. He did several interviews over the years alleging Boeing pushed aside safety procedures to keep things running smoothly.
The timing of Barnett's death has caused a lot of internet speculation, in ways that might be expected. As of right now, however, we don't know very many details about the 62-year-old's passing. Still, people are, in general, very suspicious of Boeing.

What now for Boeing?
Well, that's not clear. The company has to come up with a quality improvement plan per the FAA's orders.
""Boeing must commit to real and profound improvements,"" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said last month. ""Making foundational change will require a sustained effort from Boeing's leadership, and we are going to hold them accountable every step of the way.""
However, the FAA hasn't specified how they would punish the company if it did not deliver results.
For now, customers seem to be taking things into their own hands. There have been a lot of posts from folks saying they'd no longer fly in a Boeing aircraft. And people are now using sites like Kayak to filter Boeing planes out of their travel plans.

Touted by executives as “an excellent opportunity for suppliers to showcase their capabilities,” the summit is also an opportune chance for Boeing to network directly with suppliers, vendors, and global customers on aviation, weapons supply-chain logistics, and strategy.
Governor Jay Inslee has notably and openly sparred with Boeing over the company’s scorched-earth fight against unions, its dangerous cost-cutting, and its outsourcing of work. The Governor however celebrates the convening of DSS, going as far as lending a featured quote for the summit's site, noting that he’s “pleased to welcome back the international aerospace community to the center of US aviation and aerospace innovation - Washington state.”
But the warm welcome offered to DSS by Gov Inslee is not extended by all—especially not by those in Seattle’s anti-war, environmental, and human rights movements.
Boeing is currently the world’s third-largest weapons transnational corporation (W-TNC), and one of the foremost profiteers from armed conflict all over the world.
As the US military continues to set records as the world’s largest institutional carbon emitter, Boeing rakes in superprofit, having secured over $14 billion in US Department of Defense contracts in 2022 alone. The company's stock soared in the wake of Israel’s siege of Gaza in November as it secured a further $2.3 billion in US Air Force contracts for KC-46A refueling jets (which enable long-range aerial attacks seen in the recent US-bombings of Iraq and Syria) on top of an established KC-46 contract with Israel worth over $900 million. These refueling jets are nearly identical to 767 commercial jets and notably all to be built in Everett. Over 30,000 Palestinians have now been killed since reports broke on shipments of Boeing AI-guided “smart bombs” also being rushed to Israel, with artificial intelligence believed to be a reason for the speed of the massive death tolls amidst blockages of humanitarian aid.
While Jay Inslee and business interests may celebrate Boeing’s presence in our state, a coalition spearheaded by Resist US-Led War and endorsed by over 50 other community organizations are gathering to oppose the Boeing DSS convening on Tuesday March 12. In late January, the International Court of Justice delivered a preliminary decision supporting the “plausibility” of South Africa’s claim that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and protesters are especially outraged by Boeing’s defense aircraft and weaponry being sold to Israel. But Boeing’s perpetuation of war is global, including in countries like the Philippines, and it is therefore complicit in global loss of life, ecocide, and the climate crisis.
How is Boeing complicit in human death, ecocide and the climate crisis? Less than half of Boeing’s contracts are commercial. The rest relate to global services and defense, including attack helicopters, bomber planes, and nuclear weapons missiles. Its fighter jets in particular use massive amounts of fossil fuel, measured in gallons per mile, not the other way around.
Even if the US Air Force were to “go green” and fly on some alternative fuel, Boeing would still be hungry for the raw materials it needs to build and fly aircraft. The mining of bauxite ore, a key ingredient in aluminum production, destroys forests, soil, and water. Boeing’s commercial division alone utilizes up to 150 million pounds of aluminum annually, while workers in bauxite mining hubs such as Guinea experience severe environmental degradation and exploitation, at times even halting extraction due to mass protest.
Mining for lithium and cobalt, key ingredients of batteries used for Boeing’s products, also threaten land, water, indigenous culture, and international relations, globally and domestically here in the US. And there would be no abatement in Boeing’s global presence, which mirrors that of the US military.
US military interference and dominance in the Philippines has an especially long history since the US invaded the archipelago in 1899, and Philippine communities have been surviving and resisting that dominance for as long. The most recent Global Witness report on land defenders documented 177 killings of environmentalists in the 2022 calendar year; that total includes dozens of victims throughout South America, victims in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (where over 70% of the world’s cobalt is extracted), and a total of 11 killed in the Philippines, making it the most dangerous country in Asia for environmentalists (again) for the 10th straight year.
Seattle may also remember the impassioned plea of the Filipino delegate Yeb Saño at the 2013 COP in Warsaw, while his brother the environmentalist and peace activist A.G. Saño reported to him the devastation caused by super typhoon Haiyan laying waste to their community back home.
While Boeing has long been a beneficiary of billion-dollar arms deals with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), abuses by the US-backed Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) against activists have only intensified in recent years. Since Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. came to power in June 2022, there have been increased instances of repression of indigenous land defenders, over 60,000 civilians impacted by indiscriminate bombings and firings by the AFP, and even abductions of youth environmental activists by GRP state forces, all as reported by the Philippine-based human rights alliance Karapatan in the last several months.
350 Seattle, the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP), and the Climate Crisis and Militarism Project of Veterans for Peace are all part of the world-wide movement to mitigate the climate crisis and promote lasting peace and justice—climate, racial, and economic justice. Environmentalists and human rights activists everywhere should be concerned not only about the US military’s vast and largely unreported greenhouse gas emissions, but also its role providing military protection for oil corporations, and its squandering of trillions of dollars needed for addressing the climate crisis and people’s needs.
Meanwhile, people’s demands are holding the US government accountable for enriching W-TNCs such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing instead of doing the hard work of negotiating agreements and treaties to de-escalate conflict and address basic needs. Only through a just and lasting peace will communities worldwide recover, rebuild, and repair sustainable and reciprocal relationships with land, water, air, and each other.
Join us Tuesday to oppose Boeing and say “NO TO DSS”! “CUT TIES WITH BOEING”!

- The cockpit in the 747 underwent two significant upgrades, in the 747-400 and later, the 747-8.
- The Boeing 747 cockpit evolved from analog gauges to glass screens like the 747-400's CRTs.
- Modern Boeing 747-8 cockpit uses LCD screens, electronic checklists, and Electronic Flight Bags.
The Boeing 747 was introduced into service in 1970 and was in production for 55 years before being discontinued. During its impressive production run, Boeing produced more than 34 variants (both civilian and military), which is more than any other Jetliner.
Through the ages, technology improved drastically, and as a result, the 747 was upgraded at every turn. It extended the aircraft's longevity and ensured that flight crews had the latest equipment to keep flights safe and efficient. An area that evolved significantly was the cockpit, from analog gauges to a fully digital cockpit and everything in between.
Gauges and gauges
The 747-100 had no digital screens inside the cockpit and displayed information through analog gauges. Outside the typical flight instruments, the crew had to monitor hydraulics, electrics, powerplants, and more.
All the different gauges displayed different information and had to be monitored to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. The engine panel alone had 16 gauges, four for each engine. As a result, there was another member of the flight crew: a flight engineer.
The flight engineer has to monitor 50 gauges as well as switches, lights, and circuit breakers, then filter the information to the pilots, allowing them to focus on flying. Many other aircraft at the time required a flight engineer, but the quad-engined 747 pushed the limits of their instrument scan.
One of the less talked about features of the Boeing 747-100 was the Inertial Navigation System (INS). The system was developed for the Apollo program and is now a mainstay on all jetliners. It removed the need for a flight navigator, which was common then.
Glass versus gauge
The 747-400 marks the second generation of the aircraft's cockpit. Six CRT screens and three Flight Management Computers (FMC) replaced many analog gauges.
The pilots each had two dedicated displays: a Primary Flight Display (PFD) for flight instruments and a Multi-Function Display (MFD), which showed other information such as maps, radar, and additional supplementary flight information. The Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) takes up the middle two screens and allows the pilots to monitor the aircraft's systems.
The three FMSs input the route, load, fuel, and other trip information. It uses the data to calculate the cruising airspeed, Mach number, and optimum altitude, among other things. The FMC is also used to input NAVAID and radio frequencies.
The breakthrough of glass cockpit technology and EICAS made the role of the flight engineer redundant, as the computers did most of the processing and only alerted the crew about abnormalities.
Dream cockpit
The next significant upgrade for the 747s cockpit was with the 747-8, which featured technology ripped straight out of Boeing's newest aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner. The new cockpit is more streamlined to reduce pilot workload and is equipped with all the bells and whistles you can think of. It is produced by association with Rockwell Collins.
Gone are the six old CRT screens. All of them have been replaced with Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). The pilots still get two screens each, but the two EICAS screens have been consolidated into one screen, and the remaining screen is now called the electronic checklist. It contains all the checklists, reducing the amount of paper and documents the crew must carry. It also allows the airline to revise, update, and distribute checklists across the fleet.
Two screens can be added on either side of the cockpit, near the pilot's thighs. These two screens are part of the Boeing Class 3 Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), an option for the 747-8. The screens further reduce the crew's reliance on paper and allow the flight crew to seamlessly communicate with dispatchers and Air Traffic Control (ATC).
The three FMCs are retained but upgraded to meet new specifications and standards. The Rockwell Collins CISS 2100 configurable integrated surveillance system is integrated into the new avionics suite, which handles the Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS), Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and transponders.

Only one of 14 partially automated systems tested by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety performed well enough to get an overall “acceptable” rating. Two others were rated “marginal,” while the rest were rated “poor.” No system received the top rating of “good.”
“Most of them don’t include adequate measures to prevent misuse and keep drivers from losing focus on what’s happening on the road,” said IIHS President David Harkey.
The institute, Harkey said, came up with the new ratings to get automakers to follow standards, including how closely they watch drivers and how fast the cars issue warnings if drivers aren’t paying attention.
It also says it is trying to fill a “regulatory void” left by inaction on the systems from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Harkey said the agency needs to do more to set standards for the systems, which are not able to drive vehicles themselves.
The agency said Tuesday that it welcomes the IIHS research and will review the report.
IIHS safety ratings are closely followed by automakers, which often make changes to comply with them.
The 14 systems, which include several variations from single automakers, are among the most sophisticated now on the market, Harkey said.
Only one of the systems, Teammate in the Lexus LS, earned the adequate rating. General Motors’ Super Cruise in the GMC Sierra and Nissan’s Pro-Pilot Assist with Navi-Link in the Ariya electric vehicle were rated marginal.
Other systems from Nissan, Tesla, BMW, Ford, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo were rated poor.
Harkey said the driving systems initially were combinations of safety features such as automatic emergency braking, lane departure warnings, lane centering and blind-spot detection. But now they give drivers the chance to not pay attention for some period of time, raising safety risks, he said in an interview.
“That’s why the focus is on how do we make sure that the driver remains focused on the driving task,” Harkey said.
Some automakers, he said, market the systems in a way that drivers could think they are fully autonomous. “The one thing we do not want is for drivers to misinterpret what these things can or cannot do,” he said.
The systems, IIHS said, should be able to see if a driver’s head or eyes are not directed on the road, and whether their hands are on the wheel or ready to grab it if necessary.
The institute also said if a system doesn’t see a driver’s eyes on the road or hands aren’t ready to steer, there should be audible and visual alerts within 10 seconds. Before 20 seconds, the system should add a third alert or start an emergency procedure to slow down the vehicle, the institute said.
Automakers should also make sure safety systems such as seat belts and automatic emergency braking are activated before the driving systems can be used, it said.
None of the 14 systems met all the driver monitoring requirements in the test, but Ford’s came close, the group said.
Lexus’ Teammate system and GM’s Super Cruise met the warning requirements, while systems from Nissan and Tesla were close.
Harkey said automakers already are responding to the tests and preparing changes, many of which can be accomplished with software updates.
Toyota, which makes Lexus vehicles, said it considers IIHS ratings in setting up safety standards, while GM said the IIHS ratings are important. Nissan said it will work with the institute.
Mercedes said the company said it takes the findings seriously, and it relies on the system collaborating with the driver, while Hyundai luxury brand Genesis said it is quickly improving its system, including the addition of an in-cabin camera. Volvo said it supports IIHS efforts to reduce misuse of driver assist systems
BMW said it respects IIHS’s efforts, but it differs philosophically about how systems should monitor drivers. One BMW system evaluated by IIHS is not intended for drivers to take their hands off the wheel and only considers input from steering wheel sensors. BMW tests have not found a clear advantage in turning on the driver monitoring camera, the company said. Another more sophisticated system intended for drivers to take hands off the steering wheel uses a camera to watch drivers, the company said.
Ford said its Blue Cruise system monitors drivers and sends repeated warnings. The company said it disagrees with IIHS’ findings but will consider its feedback in updates.",https://fortune.com/2024/03/12/tesla-bmw-mercedes-rated-automated-driving-test/

First, the vehicle struggled to go up a basic slope at a California off-road park; then Ford CEO Jim Farley publicly poked fun at the Cybertruck and I made it clear that The Cybertruck will still kick the Ford’s F-150 Lightning’s ass; then there was a video of a Cybertruck getting stuck in snow and being pulled out by a Ford; then there were various other videos of the Cybertruck seemingly struggling in the winter. So if the Cybertruck is so bad off-road, then what’s with this new video from Tesla showing the truck climbing up one of the most challenging off-road obstacles on earth? Let’s take a look.
I’ve written about the Tesla Cybertruck’s off-road capability a few times because I have a background in off-roading, and there’s lots of bullshit flying around that needs to be broken down. My first article was in response to all the fanboys claiming the Cybertruck was going to be the best off-road vehicle ever. It’s not. It’s too big, and its four-wheel drive system probably isn’t ever going to match a fully locked system when it comes to rock crawling.
Then Ford CEO Jim Farley tweeted that video of the Lightning handily climbing a grade that had apparently made a Cybertruck prototype struggle in another online video.
This time, I defended the Cybertruck because I know it has more off-road potential than Ford’s offering, the F-150 Lightning, largely due to the Tesla’s favorable geometry. The title of my article was “Ford CEO Takes Shot At Tesla Cybertruck With Off-Road Video Of F-150 Lightning, Which Is Going To Get Its Ass Kicked.”
F-150 Lightning does it all. ???? pic.twitter.com/uCMUSxUIpj
— Jim Farley (@jimfarley98) November 15, 2023
Here’s why I claimed the F-150 Lightning would get its ass kicked by the Cybertruck:
The video shows a prototype Tesla Cybertruck. It won’t take much to vastly improve that traction control system to better get the motors’ power down to the ground to propel the vehicle forward. That’s just software. Is it going to be as good as a mechanical locker? Maybe not! Or maybe Tesla will actually offer a locker for the two wheels on the same axle — regardless, even if the Ford’s traction control system is better than the Tesla’s, torque transfer is only a small part of the off-road equation. The biggest slice of the off-road pie is all about geometry, and in that area, the Cybertruck is probably going to demolish the F-150 Lightning.
[…]
To be clear, the Cybertruck’s geometry — even at max ride height — isn’t going to be amazing, simply by virtue of it being a pickup that needs four doors and a bed, but there’s no way it’ll be as bad as the F-150 Lightning’s, so when the time comes for a head-to-head, I have no doubt that the Lightning will be left in the dust. But for now, while Tesla is still working on the Cybertruck, it’s Jim Farley — who runs a car company that sells an EV pickup truck that you can buy today at a dealership — who fairly gets to have a bit of fun on Twitter.
When it comes to off-roading, geometry is king, and if you’re Ford, and your F-150 Lightning has a giant battery pack hanging way down low to the ground, you should be careful not to brag too much. Like I said before, all it would take was some software to get the Cybertruck leagues ahead of the Lightning. And I think we might be there:
Obviously, this is a Tesla-produced video; it’s an ad, so we need to take it all with a grain of salt. It’s also worth noting that even Kia managed to get a lightly-modified Sorento (hardly a true off-road vehicle) crossover up Hell’s Gate:
But you can just look at that Cybertruck video and see how effortlessly it climbed that tricky grade versus the Sorento.
You see, the reason why Hell’s Gate is so challenging is that it’s absurdly steep, and it requires a vehicle to drive up a V-crack, then a bit farther up the right wall, then drive back down into the V-crack and ultimately to the top of the hill. This means tires are going to want to lift off the rock, and if you’ve got just a standard open differential, then a lifted tire on an axle will spin up way fast, taking away the power that the other wheel on the axle — the wheel on the rock that you need to propel the vehicle up the grade.
The obstacle is a test of a few things, really; there’s geometry, of course (you’ve got to keep the bumpers from hitting the rock); there’s torque at the wheels, of course (you need to crawl up the grade nice and slowly); and there’s articulation (i.e. can you keep the tires on the ground). If you’ve got a vehicle that doesn’t have a ton of suspension flex – like the Cybertruck and other fully independent suspension-equipped trucks – then traction control really becomes the ticket to making it up the grade (i.e. can you make sure power is sent to the wheels with grip, and in a controlled and predictable way?).
The Cybertruck Hell’s Gate ad shows a vehicle slowly ascending the grade in a reasonably controlled fashion. It’s still not perfect.
The truck starts ascending the grade favoring the right wall. This takes some weight off the driver’s side tire, and you can see that tire flare up (i.e. spin quickly). This isn’t what you want when you’re trying to ascend a steep grade slowly and in a controlled manner; you want the tangential velocity of your tread to roughly match that of your vehicle (which is done effectively via a traditional locked-differential system; Tesla has to try to do this using sensors — a difficult challenge). You can see the truck quickly slide over to the driver’s side of the V-crack:
At 31 seconds into that video, you can again see the truck favor the right wall (that’s the right line, from my experience), resulting yet again in the driver’s side tire wanting to lift. As a result, the tire again spins up, and this time the truck bounces a bit up and down. This is not ideal, as this type of bouncing is the leading cause of axle shaft failure. Still, the bouncing isn’t egregious based on what I see here.
Then at about 38 seconds in the truck lifts that driver’s side tire way off the terrain, and while the truck seems to handle that reasonably well, it does look like the vehicle speed was a bit high here, likely due to the driver trying to make up for that lake of propulsion from the front left tire. With an ideal system — for example, a fully locked center/front/rear diff on a typical 4×4 — the driver really wouldn’t have to apply any more pedal when a tire lifts off the ground; the tires with grip will continue to move the vehicle up the grade at the same rate so long as one tire has good grip.
Still, overall the Cybertruck seemed to handle what is, frankly, a pretty challenging grade, with relatively little drama. It’s not really a grade that you can ascend without drama unless you’ve got a decent traction control system, so whatever issues Tesla was having before in that California off-road park, it seems the company’s engineering team has solved some of them.
I myself cannot wait to put the truck to the test off-road; I just need to find someone who’s got a truck to lend me…
Is it true they are closing down trails in/near Moab this year?
Yes, because of irresponsible behavior and environmental damage. However, it’s only a small percentage of the entire trail system…like 10% or something.
10% isn’t too bad. Hopefully after they clean up any damage they can reopen the trails.
Somehow, that brain of mine first read “…Kia managed to get a lightly-modified Sorento (hardly a...” as “…Kia managed to get a highly-modified Sorento…”, and I went into full battle-whine mode.
Re-read. Always re-raed. Alsway de-read !!!
I have zero knowledge of the way traction control works in electric vehicles, but wouldn’t it just take a few lines of code to have an “all diffs locked” mode in an EV with four motors? Just get them to spin all at the same rate, all the time this mode is engaged – more throttle, faster forward motion.
This. Waiting for someone to enlighten us
I asked this on a previous article about the Cybertruck and it was pointed out that you can’t just set the electric motor to run at a given speed, you only control how much power is being sent to each motor. You basically need an electronic diff like most AWD vehicles these days where you read the wheel speed and adjust power delivery on the fly. That obviously can be done, but it’s still not as good as a fully locked diff.
Sure you can, you just need a motor with a built in encoder that is counting revolutions. Servo motors like these are used all around the place for automation as they allow you to move things precisely without relying on timers, position switches or caring about what you’re moving around.
That’s only true if they were using servo motors, which to my knowledge they are not. Maybe someone building a dedicated off road EV will some day though.
You can still have a rotary encoder on any motor type.
Okay I feel like I need to clear up a whole bunch of conflicting info about EV traction systems here.
yfn electrigg vehicule nerd
So for instance let’s say the Cybertruck is all “electronic lock” only, no clutches between the two sides. You hit the touchscreen slider gesture facial recognition dongle that says “lock (idk how teslas work). All 4 wheels are sent the same velocity command and they do their darndest to keep up.
You climb the hill and hit a rock that is pretty big. The torque demand on that wheel momentarily rises above what the motor can put out as it’s being forced into the rock. The inverter cannot supply any more current to make torque, so that wheel experiences a steep drop in velocity as a result.
I expect this will feel somewhat like if a manual locking hub isn’t quite tight and that half-shaft “slips” a bit.
I would think because the cyber truck uses induction motors for the rear axle they would require motor slip to produce torque, and if wheel torque varies quickly then you would have lots of slip due to the wind up that a 4 wheel locked vehicle would not.
The Rivian on the other hand has 4 wheel synchronous motors which should be able to output a specified speed independent of the wheel torque as long it remains below the maximum. But from videos it looks like it still doesn’t function as a locked vehicle because the tires will spin when they lose traction.
It also could be that at such slow speeds there aren’t enough steps (motor poles) in the motors to have smooth application of torque. More steps (poles) in the motors would hurt top speed. Really they might just need a low range, which would be impractical on a vehicle with 3-4 independent motors.
This is a Tesla produced video, so for all we know that thing only had enough batteries installed to make it to the top. They could have stripped literally a ton or more out of the test vehicle. I truly don’t trust anything from any company led by King Baby Musk.
Let’s see this reproduced with a production truck and a passenger in it. Then I might believe it’s true.
I get it. But Hell’s Gate isn’t actually hard, so if a barely modified Sorento can do it, a production stupidtruck should do this without much issue. It looks scary, but it’s not that technically challenging or impressive to me. If anything, I’m wowed by the complete lack of wheel travel. I feel like most trucks (excepting the Maverick, Ridgeline, etc.) have more wheel travel and could do this even easier.
I finally saw two of these on a transport truck the other day!
Yeah.. they absolutely look as stupid in person as they do in pictures.
Wow! These AI vids are getting really good! 😉
I don’t care if it can crawl up the side of the Empire State Building, it’s ugly as hell.
Sounds like Tesla is embracing the MVP (minimum viable product) common in software – just get a working thing out there and add features (or tuning) later. Definitely a different approach than normal with “physical things” like cars. Just have to hope the features and fixes people want make it off the backlog and into prod.
I, too, work in Agilefall. Nice to meet a fellow practitioner!
I hate this trend so much. As a gamer, car enthusiast, and IT professional, I have to experience it on all fronts. OTA updates and day 1 patches just enable companies to put out unfinished products, letting the consumer/end user find and report the bugs instead of doing proper testing and bug fixing.
Wonders if a Chevy Citation could climb Hell’s Gate……..hmmmmmm (◔ૂ◔)
“Looks” like that Utah “art installation” from a few years back fallen over.
Picture caption is wrong. “Looks dialed in” That look will never be dialed in.
It was certainly phoned in….
I saw the video and thought maybe an electric vehicle has finally been dialed in. I was unimpressed with other EVs off-road capabilities, including the Rivian and Hummer.
Yeah but normally this happens before SOP…
They are going for the video game dev method of “we can patch it out later”
Yeah, but can it do hell’s gate faster than Rory driving trailmater in reverse?
Won’t be impressed by this until I see it go up dragging the Turdmeister up by his ankles. And that still probably won’t seal the deal.
Glad that some folks here like their Teslas.
But I would rather trust the Wizard of Oz to tell the truth than Cyber Boy. YMMV.
Truck goes up hill? BFD….
I was driving a new Range Rover this weekend. It does stuff. So much stuff.
I suspect the Venn diagram overlap of the number of people who can afford.a Cybertruck and the number who actually want one will remain a tiny segment. Throw in a third circle for people who will off-road a Cybertruck and that overlap segment will shrink to total insignificance.
This is completely pedantic but I just learned this recently: It’s only a Venn diagram if there’s overlap in all categories shown; otherwise it’s a Euler diagram (all Venn diagrams are also Euler diagrams, but not all Euler diagrams are Venn diagrams).
I do agree with your sentiment though!
Pretty sure this would still be a Venn diagram–there should (in theory, at least), be overlap in all of these categories. There’s gotta be someone who can afford a Cybertruck, wants one, and will offroad it.
Aw, damn. You’re right. A tiny overlap is still overlap.
It’s still a nice thing to remember. You often hear things like “the Venn diagram of people who [blank] and people who are [blank] is two circles with no overlap.” Euler diagrams deserve some credit, especially since the Euler circle completely contains the Venn circle on the Euler diagram of Euler/Venn diagrams.
Respectfully, please go to hell.
Why? I’m being supportive of your pedantry!
Consider me enlightened.
Pedantry for the win.
I am not sure I understand; please provide some sort of illustrative diagram.
https://mdmhirogoto.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/chapter-5-2.png
In case that link doesn’t work, short summary:
if you have circles with no overlap existing as part of the same diagram, it’s not a Venn diagram. Venn diagrams must have overlap.
No, no, I wanted a diagram of the types of diagrams – I guess it would be a Euler, with the big circle being Eulers and the little circle inside being Venns.
Please also include and indicate in Venn form any circles that are non-Euler.
For a moment there I read your name as VennGuy.
I bet that the segment of people that will never off-road it will still find the fact it *can* off-road very important to their purchase. Consumers love knowing that their stuff is super capable, even if they never use it. Think about all the sports car buyers who just want to cruise up and down Santa Monica, but still buy the fastest thing available despite being less comfortable, less attractive and less practical.
As an autopian I enjoy using vehicles that “can’t” or at least shouldn’t. Move 1000 miles in a compact sedan? Off road in a Buick. Drive my slow car fast (where safe). It strikes me as fun and as a bonus I learned how to fix radiators, thermostats, half shafts, brakes, rotors and door handles!
I didn’t enjoy moving in a sedan but when you are poor you got no choice.
I fully agree, shoving everything I owned in a 20-year-old A4 was a point of pride for me, and I just “downgraded” to half the power from my last car because it wasn’t exciting below 100mph. 200 feels like kind of the sweet spot for me, I’d buy a BRZ if the insurance premiums weren’t so insanely high on those. I like pushing a vehicle’s limits, not just knowing they’re higher than I’ll ever reach. A fast car only lets you stretch how brave (ahem, stupid) you are, a slow car actually lets you exercise skill.
Same with off-roading, what’s the point of buying a vehicle so capable that you have to drive 10+ hours to the nearest challenging trail? It’s such a waste to visit the “outdoors” inside an air-conditioned, noise-insulated, hyper-capable apartment on wheels. The best times I’ve ever had off-road were in a one-seater buggy with no windshield, no diff, a CVT and 14bhp.
Call me old fashioned, but when I was in product development, the intention was to engineer for well-foreseen issues like taking a truck off-road *before* the on-sale date, not just release betas on the public.
For better or worse, Tesla is sticking to their philosophy of acting like a tech company.
I think that pretty much all companies/products used to be released as you describe. Today there is just too much emphasis on being first rather than being best.
First is more important because you can always lie about being the best, at least for awhile, and especially if you own a massive social media platform, too.
I think you’re right, but what’s funny about this was 1) the CT was already super late, so who cares if they took another month to get the calibration dialed in better, and 2) the Lightning was already on the market, so they were never going to be first anyways.
In any case, it doesn’t matter, no one who wants one of these is going to be bothered in the least by any of this.
It’s an odd characteristic of the world we live in. Nearly 100% of these will be purchased for daily driver trips for groceries and commutes to work with a few percentage points of contractors (maybe) if they want some extra visual attention for their electric business.
But there will be plenty of YouTube channel reviews that will highlight deficiencies in areas that won’t matter to anyone considering one of these things.
And yet the press from a bad YT video in performance or utility will still have a negative impact on the perception by the mall crawling crowds. Why are we considered the most intelligent inhabitants on Earth again?
Because we control the media.
Dammit, I’m going to rely entirely on non-human media from now on. I hear whales have a pretty good pod cast.
Never fear because A.I. is here!!!.
Very good!
I might also catch the trout live stream. Spiders have a pretty good web presence, too.
I hear birds posted pretty reliable tweets before it was renamed.
COTD, and I don’t usually say that about puns, but this is just a perfect response. 😀
GM and Chrysler push products out the door with design flaws and then never fixes them.
It’s a good point. As long as continuous improvement is the goal we should applaud this more. There’s a few too many instances of updates to remove features because they decided they should charge monthly instead of a single payment at purchase for me to like it but the potential is there for a better ownership experience.
I mean, I get your point, but if it was fully competent on the road or on basic dirt roads even before these updates (assuming they’re 100% software updates only), I’d say that’s the important piece. Anyone who’s doing terrain like this on the regular is probably looking for things with better geometry, anyway…right?
The ability to remotely update significant aspects/functionality of vehicles truly is a sea change. Yeah, better if it was good by default, but…it doesn’t look like the lack was a safety issue first, for example.
Except when you are Tesla and just view customers and public roads as a paid-for beta….
As long as Tesla buyers don’t care, they will keep doing this.
This will come in very handy for owners on their way to the mall.

Following the loss of the door plug, which led to a rapid decompression, the flight crew returned to Portland where the airplane landed safely. Of the 171 passengers and six crewmembers onboard, eight reported minor injuries.

A former Boeing employee known for raising concerns about the firm's production standards has been found dead in the US.
John Barnett worked for Boeing for more than 30 years before retiring in 2017.
In the days before his death, he had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company.
Boeing said it was saddened to hear of Mr Barnett's passing. The Charleston County coroner confirmed his death to the BBC on Monday.
It said the 62-year-old had died from a ""self-inflicted"" wound on 9 March and police were investigating.
Mr Barnett had worked for the US plane giant for three decades, until his retirement in 2017 on health grounds.
From 2010, he was employed as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant. The facility builds the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.
In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line.
He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency.
He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.
He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing.
He said in some cases, sub-standard parts had even been removed from scrap bins and fitted to planes that were being built to prevent delays on the production line.
He also claimed that tests on emergency oxygen systems due to be fitted to the 787 showed a failure rate of 25%, meaning that one in four could fail to deploy in a real-life emergency.
Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken.
Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.
It established that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial action.
On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly"". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.
After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company.
He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing.
At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case.
Last week, he gave a formal deposition in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel.
He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel.
He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park.
Speaking to the BBC, his lawyer described his death as ""tragic"".
In a statement Boeing said: ""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""
His death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny.
This follows an incident in early January when an unused emergency exit door blew off a brand-new Boeing 737 Max shortly after take-off from Portland International Airport.
A preliminary report from the US National Transportation Safety Board suggested that four key bolts, designed to hold the door securely in place, were not fitted.
Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found ""multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements"".",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703

Until she was actually accepted at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, it never occurred to Coral Scotland (’24) that she would follow her father’s academic journey at the world’s leading aviation and aerospace educator.
Her acceptance to Embry-Riddle came just days before her father’s passing in 2020, and while Coral was ready to make her late father proud, the cost of college loomed large for a family that had just suffered a grievous loss.
That’s where The Boeing Company came in.
Coral was chosen as part of the 2020 cohort of Boeing Scholars, the second ever at Embry-Riddle, and the award helped cover many of the expenses that otherwise might have stopped her education before it started.
Each fall, Boeing awards a select group of outstanding freshmen scholarships of $5,000 to $7,500 yearly for two years as they begin degree programs at Embry-Riddle. The scholarships are supported by a $3 million endowment from the world’s largest aerospace company and leading aircraft manufacturer and include exclusive tours of Boeing facilities and networking opportunities with key company leaders.
“This significantly alleviated my out-of-pocket costs and seemed to be a direct sign from God that I needed to pursue my higher education at Embry-Riddle,” Coral said.
As she prepares to graduate with her B.S. in Aviation Business Administration from the Daytona Beach Campus, Coral took time to reflect on her Embry-Riddle experience, the support she got from Boeing and her quest to make her dad and mom proud.
Tell us about your background
I was born in Pembroke Pines, Florida, but I call Antigua, a very small island in the Caribbean, my home. My parents are immigrants; they grew up in poverty and worked extremely hard to build a better life here for their family.
I grew up with one older and two younger sisters, and I had an amazing childhood filled with nothing but memories of happiness. We’re a Christian family, so church has also always been a safe space for me.
How did you first get interested in aviation?
My interest is because of my father, Embry-Riddle alumnus Robert F. J. Scotland (’92). He was a plane connoisseur who worked as a jet engine salesman, which allowed him to travel the world and talk about planes (what more could a lover of the sky ask for, right?).
My family and I lived about 20 minutes from North Perry Airport in South Florida, and my dad could tell the different types of planes just by their SOUND alone. He never ceased to amaze me with his vast knowledge of airplanes, the way they worked, the math, the physics, the engineering and even the weather.
In this photo from December 2017, Coral Scotland and her mom, Dr. Dion Phillips-Scotland, celebrate the birthday of Coral’s dad, Robert Scotland. (Photo: Coral Scotland)
My father would also take me on practice flights while working toward his private pilot’s license. I was giddy to get into a plane with my father as the pilot in command. He used to say he wanted his children to get pilot’s licenses more than he wanted them to get driver’s licenses.
So, in the months before my 16th birthday, my father began preparing me for my own flight lessons. I got handed down his expensive headphones and all his flight equipment, even his slightly banged-up flight bag and fuel sump.
If I have one regret in life, it is not finishing my private pilot program. After my father’s passing in 2020, I found it nearly impossible to fly without crying or thinking of him. I always remember him talking about the day we could fly, just him and I, in a Cessna, wherever we wanted, whenever we wanted. Despite having three other daughters, I was the only one who shared his immense love for flying.
My father never got to see me fly solo, and that pains me a lot. I still hope to honor my father’s wishes one day and earn my private license because he is the reason I love aviation.
Why did you choose Embry-Riddle for college?
My dad. I had no intention of attending university, and even though I had started several college applications to satisfy my mom, I never completed them. I remember being with my dad in his hospital room one day, and he randomly asked if I had applied to Embry-Riddle yet.
When I said no, he made me apply on my laptop right there, and he never had a doubt that I would be accepted. Although I had done well in school, I never thought about going to college, let alone at a prestigious private aeronautical institution.
He watched over my shoulder as I filled out my application from start to finish and saw me hit “submit.” When I told him shortly before he passed away that I had been accepted, he simply nodded and said, “Good.”
How did you feel about being selected as a Boeing Scholar?
I felt undeserving at first. In my eyes, I hadn’t done anything particularly special to merit earning a scholarship from a company as renowned as Boeing.
But it was crystal clear this was all part of God’s divine plan for me. I was elated to be accepted to this prestigious university, but I knew I could not afford it.
I was proud to be one of nine Boeing Scholars for the entire university. At the time, though, I did not understand the magnitude or benefits of the award. I had no idea just how much more was to come my way from being part of this exclusive group. All in all, I was just grateful to God for being chosen.
How has being a Boeing Scholar shaped your Embry-Riddle experience so far?
Having the title of Boeing Scholar has let me know that I am qualified to be here and that I can do this. Boeing believed in me before I even believed in myself.
Like Embry-Riddle’s reputation precedes me, so does my title as a Boeing Scholar. It has opened doors that I didn’t even know existed, such as being invited to networking events with Boeing executives and going on field trips to Boeing facilities.
This summer, I will be starting an on-campus internship with Boeing, and I know being a Boeing Scholar gave me a foot in the door. I am part of the Engineering Developmental Program as a Supply Chain intern, and being a Boeing Scholar has also made me more confident in who I am and where I have the potential to go.
What are some of the most significant benefits of being a Boeing Scholar?
It has allowed me to meet so many important people from Boeing and on the Embry-Riddle campus.
My name is forever ingrained here as a 2020 Boeing Scholar, something I am eternally grateful for.
What is your favorite memory about being part of the Boeing Scholar program?
My all-time favorite memory was the opportunity to visit the 787 Dreamliner facility in Charleston, South Carolina, which was the experience of a lifetime. Because when else would I have the opportunity for an exclusive, in-depth tour of a facility like this? When would I have had the time, money or resources to meet the people I met that day?
It was my favorite not just because of its exclusivity but because it completely revolutionized what I wanted to do in the future.
I had been an Aerospace Engineering major my first two years at Embry-Riddle, and I never felt quite right. Although I was capable of the work, I never found enjoyment or fulfillment in my classes like I did in high school. I couldn’t relate to any of my peers on a social level, and I was struggling to feel like I fit in at Embry-Riddle, especially as a black female.
In December 2021, I had gone on my first trip to visit Boeing’s Cape Canaveral site. A central part of the visit included one-on-one meetings with top engineers and the head of the facility. Unfortunately, I did NOT enjoy the trip. In fact, it made me feel even more alienated from my colleagues and potential future coworkers, who never seemed to have any doubts about what they were doing.
I was struggling. After the trip, I found myself failing classes and wanting to drop out of college completely. Ultimately, I found the courage to do what was best for me, and I switched my major to Aviation Business Administration. Although I faced some heavy scrutiny from family members and close friends, I knew in my heart that all my dad ever wanted was for me to be happy.
So, I pushed forward.
In Fall 2022, when I made my trip to the Dreamliner facility, I went as a business major instead of an engineer. It allowed me to look at Boeing with a fresh set of eyes. Our tour guides were wonderful Boeing employees whom I could relate to and talk to far more easily than anyone I had met previously.
The second trip showed me that I didn’t have to force myself to fit into a box to be an asset. I had skills and talents that people don’t normally appreciate or recognize, and I had found my calling at Boeing.
What is your ultimate career goal, and how is Embry-Riddle helping you reach it?
While my ultimate goal is to be a wife and a mother, I am now working toward a career as a part of Boeing Global Services, conducting outreach to communities and local schools and honestly just engaging with the people side of Boeing.
While I truly believe my purpose in life is to create and care for a family of my own, Embry-Riddle has given me the opportunity to grow academically and professionally. It has provided the resources and support to explore all the world has to offer me. I know I have the capacity to do wonders in the corporate world, and soon, I’ll have the degree to prove it!
What would you say to someone who wants to follow in your footsteps?
Allow yourself the chance to change your mind, to grow and to step outside of what everyone else expects from you.
As a people pleaser, all I ever wanted to do was what everyone wanted me to do, but I was so unhappy. I was scared to change my mind about the degree I wanted because I did not want people to think less of me for going from engineering to business.
I think you must be open to the idea that it’s okay to start over from scratch sometimes and to have the resilience to do what feels right for you. Remember, it took me two years to gain the courage to do what made me truly happy.
Anything else you would like to add?
I want to dedicate my experience as a Boeing Scholar at Embry-Riddle to my father, Robert, and my mother, Dr. Dion Phillips-Scotland.
I know I talked a lot about my dad as an inspiration, but without a female role model as empathetic, intelligent, diligent and devout as my mother, I would have never made it this far.
My mom answered every call when I felt like dropping out, calmed every nerve when I was scared I wouldn’t succeed and reminded me that I was loved—unconditionally. She is my rock.
I can never thank my parents enough for the foundation they built and the life they created for me. I am privileged and blessed beyond words. Knowing that they grew up impoverished but were able to build a life where they could send me to flight training and then to a private university, all while caring for their other three daughters as well … I can’t explain how much everything I’ve done is to honor my parents.”",https://erau.edu/hub-spoke/stories/boeing-scholar-program-helps-eagle-honor-the-memory-of-her-late-father

This collective effort will benefit current and future members, engineers, other Boeing employees, the supply chain, our communities, and generations to come. We are fighting for everyone.”
“This is the first contract for almost half of our members, and it’s the most important one for all of them. We want to ensure their involvement from the beginning and educate them about what we’re doing on their behalf,” said IAM District W24 President and Directing Business Representative Brandon Bryant. “The membership is the lifeblood of our union and our districts. This contract negotiation is one of the most important things that we do for them. This is our future, this our fight. We are truly fighting for the best future we can get.”
A strike sanction vote, which authorizes a strike if a collective bargaining agreement is not reached, will take place on July 17, 2024.
“Our members – and no one else – will guide this process and be the ultimate deciders on their future,” said IAM International President Brian Bryant. “Our membership has made it very clear that they will accept nothing less than a fair and just contract that will make us the leading compensated aerospace workers in the world because we deserve nothing less than that. This is about building back the reputation of Boeing as the best, most dependable, most cutting-edge aerospace company on Earth.”

“Ultimately, the goal of these negotiations is to win fairness and justice for our members. This means ensuring that the contract reflects the values and priorities of IAM members and provides the means for a prosperous future for them and their families,” said IAM Western Territory General Vice President Gary R. Allen. “Achieving this goal will require a collective effort from all our members to come together in unity and fight for what they believe in, the IAM Western Territory is confident that, together, we can win a contract that sets the standard for the aerospace industry and raises our members and their families’ standard of living – Boeing has made billions and our members deserve to receive their fair share!”
IAM District 751 represents more than 30,000 Boeing production workers in the Puget Sound region, while District W24 represents about 1,200 who work at Boeing’s parts plant in Portland, Ore.
“The IAM and our membership are expecting Boeing to come to table ready to reach a fair and just agreement,” said IAM Resident General Vice President Jody Bennett. “Our membership deserves a contract that treats them as the best and most skilled aerospace workers in the world, because that’s exactly what they are. We will be fair, but firm, on all our priorities – especially on delivering job security to our membership.”",https://www.goiam.org/news/imail/iam-stands-fully-behind-32000-district-751-district-w24-members-as-boeing-negotiations-kick-off/

John Barnett, 62, of Louisiana, who spent more than three decades at the aircraft manufacturing giant, sounded the alarm with aviation authorities in 2017 about what he said were potentially “catastrophic” safety failings.
His family said in a statement Monday that he had tried to highlight serious concerns but was met with “a culture of concealment” that valued “profits over safety.”
Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O’Neal said in a statement Monday that Barnett died “from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound” in the city Saturday.
Barnett was in town to testify in a deposition in his federal legal action against Boeing, with his case set to go before an administrative law judge later this year, according to his attorneys.
""He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on,"" the attorneys, Brian Knowles and Robert Turkewitz, said in a joint statement Tuesday. ""We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.""
They urged local police to keep investigating despite the coroner’s initial ruling.
""We are all devastated,"" the attorneys said. ""We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.""
A Charleston police spokesperson, Sgt. Anthony Gibson, said in a statement Monday that the police department had “not received any indication from the coroner’s office that foul play is suspected in this case.”
In a later statement, he pointed to the coroner’s preliminary findings and said detectives “are actively investigating this case and are awaiting the formal cause of death, along with any additional findings that might shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barnett.”
Case was up for trial in June
The statement from Barnett's family said that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety attacks and that the “hostile work environment at Boeing” led to his death.
In a statement Monday, Boeing said: ""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.” Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the allegations in the family’s statement.
Barnett, known as Mitch to his family and “Swampy” to his friends, had worked at Boeing’s 787 plant in Charleston since 2010, his family said.
In 2019, The New York Times interviewed several former Boeing employees about their safety concerns. Barnett told the paper that metal shavings — created when metal fasteners are screwed into nuts — could cut wiring that connects the flight controls.
The Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing to clear the shavings from the Dreamliners in 2017. Boeing said then that it was following the ruling and would look to improve the design of the nut, but it also said it wasn’t a flight safety issue.
But Barnett told the Times: “I haven’t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I’d put my name on saying it’s safe and airworthy.”
After he retired in 2017, Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint with federal regulators about his experiences at the South Carolina plant. He also launched a separate legal action against Boeing, accusing it of denigrating his character and hampering his career. Boeing denied the allegations.
His case was up for trial in June, the family statement said, adding: “He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture.”
The status of the case was not immediately clear Tuesday.
Death comes amid mishaps involving Boeing
While Barnett loved his work for most of his career, in Charleston “he learned that upper management was pressuring the quality inspectors and managers to cut corners” and not to follow legally required safety processes, the statement said.
He alleged that staff members were pressured not to document defects because it would slow down the assembly line, it added.
“John told us that every day was a battle to get management to do the right thing,” the family said. The statement added that Barnett and others who highlighted problems were labeled as “trouble-makers,” whereas previously the company had rewarded those who discovered defects.
“It caused John so much stress that his doctor told him that if he stayed, he would have a heart attack,” the family said.
An obituary shared by his family said, “Mitch was fun-loving, and totally devoted to family, especially his nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews.”
It added that he is survived by his mother, Vicky Melder Stokes; three brothers, Mike Barnett, Robbie Barnett and Rodney Barnett; eight nieces and nephews; and 11 great-nieces and nephews.
Boeing faces regulatory and public scrutiny over a series of incidents involving its planes.
The Justice Department opened an investigation after a door plug blew out on an Alaska Airlines flight in January, which led to the temporary grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes. They have since returned to the air.
And Monday, 50 people were injured on a Boeing Dreamliner plane after a sudden movement midair on a flight from Sydney to Auckland, New Zealand.

The Federal Aviation Administration started the probe after a door panel blew off a 737 Max 9 flight on Alaska Airlines in early January, an incident that has attracted intense scrutiny of Boeing's quality-control practices.
The NYT report, published Tuesday, was based on a review of an internal FAA slide presentation and offered a glimpse into the numerous issues found by auditors. Many of the problems fell under the category of failure to follow ""approved manufacturing processes"" and failure to keep proper quality control documentation, according to the Times.
FAA auditors found that out of 89 product audits that were conducted, Boeing passed 56 tests and failed 33 of them, according to the report.
During the six-week audit, the FAA also conducted 13 product audits that focused on Spirit AeroSystems, which makes fuselages for the Boeing 737 Max — of those, only six audits resulting in passing grades, and seven failed, the NYT said.
A document reviewed by the Times found that a mechanic at Spirit used a hotel key card to check a door seal. In another instance, the FAA reportedly saw Spirit mechanics apply liquid Dawn soap to a door seal to use as a lubricant in the ""fit-up process.""
A spokesman for Spirit reportedly said the company was ""reviewing all identified nonconformities for corrective action.""
In late February, the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to develop a plan for quality-control improvements. Around the same time, an expert panel's report on Boeing found a ""disconnect"" between its senior management and employees regarding safety culture.
The panel report had been required by the U.S. Congress after two crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving Boeing 737 Max planes killed all the passengers and crew aboard — a total of 346 people.
In response to the NYT report and recent expert panel report, Boeing said it continues ""to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality.""
""We are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn,"" Boeing said in a statement to CNBC.
In addition to the FAA, the National Transportation Safety Board is looking into what caused the 737 Max jet door panel to blow off during the Alaska Airlines incident, and the Justice Department has reportedly begun a criminal investigation into the company.

Boeing whistleblower John Barnett’s death happened the same week as several safety issues with the company’s aircraft.
The death of Boeing whistleblower John Barnett came after a week of Boeing making headlines over a series of safety-related issues.
Here is a recap of recent incidents that have shaken the reputation of the aircraft manufacturing giant:

Whistleblower found dead
John Barnett, 62, who reported safety problems at Boeing, died on Saturday from an apparent “self-inflicted” wound, according to a coroner in the state of South Carolina in the United States.
Barnett worked as a quality manager for the US aircraft giant for more than three decades until he retired in 2017.
The BBC, which first reported Barnett’s death, said he had been providing evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company in recent days.
In 2019, Barnett alleged the aircraft maker, based just outside Washington, DC, had deliberately fitted planes with faulty parts and passengers on its 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen in the event of a sudden decompression. Boeing denied these allegations.
“We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,” Boeing told Al Jazeera in a statement.
Fifty injured on Australia-New Zealand flight
A Chilean LATAM Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner on Monday dropped abruptly midair on a flight from Australia to New Zealand.
About 50 people were treated for mostly mild injuries by paramedics after the plane touched down in Auckland. Twelve people were taken to hospital, according to an ambulance spokesperson, and one was believed to be in serious condition.
The reason for the plane’s sudden drop is currently unexplained and is under investigation by New Zealand’s Transport Accident Investigation Commission. Safety experts said most airplane accidents are caused by a combination of factors that need to be thoroughly investigated.
Boeing discloses names of employees regarding door blowout
In January, an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 aircraft made an emergency landing in Portland after a door panel blew off in midair, leaving a gaping hole in the aircraft.
On Wednesday, Boeing provided US regulators with the names of employees on the team responsible for doors on the 737 MAX.
National Transportation Safety Board Chairperson Jennifer Homendy had earlier criticised Boeing’s failure to supply the names and some key records required in the agency’s ongoing investigation.
Other recent Boeing incidents
Last week marked a wave of incidents with Boeing aircraft in the US.
On March 4, an engine fire forced a Boeing 737 to make an emergency landing in Houston, Texas, soon after takeoff. The engine ingested some plastic bubble wrap that was on the airfield prior to departure, according to United Airlines.
In Portland, Oregon, a Boeing 737-800 was forced to make an emergency landing due to fumes in the cabin on Wednesday.
On Thursday, a tyre fell off a Boeing 777-200 after it took off from San Francisco, destroying a car. The plane was bound for Japan, but it was diverted to Los Angeles, where it landed safely.
A Boeing 737 MAX rolled off the runway in Houston and got stuck in the grass on Friday.
Previous history and controversies
Boeing, which leads the commercial aircraft market alongside Europe’s Airbus, has been under intense scrutiny over its safety record since two fatal crashes involving the Boeing 737 MAX in 2018 and 2019.
The jets were grounded worldwide for almost two years after a crash killed 189 people in Indonesia in October 2018 and another killed 157 people in Ethiopia five months later.
It was found that the crashes were due to defects in the automated flight control software, which activated erroneously. The software was improved, and the Boeing 737s were revamped and cleared to fly again.
In January’s Alaska Airlines incident, the door plug of the Boeing 737 MAX 9 flew off midair. While the 2018 and 2019 crashes were caused by design defects in the flight control system, this was a defect in manufacturing with loose hardware on the aircraft.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/boeings-latest-turbulence-what-you-need-to-know

Barnett's body was found in a vehicle in a Holiday Inn parking lot in Charleston on Saturday. One day earlier, he testified about the string of problems he says he identified at Boeing's plant where he once helped inspect the 787 aircraft before delivery to customers.
Police say officers were sent to the hotel to conduct a welfare check after people were unable to contact Barnett, who had traveled to Charleston to testify in his lawsuit against Boeing.
""Upon their arrival, officers discovered a male inside a vehicle suffering from a gunshot wound to the head,"" police said in a statement sent to NPR. ""He was pronounced deceased at the scene.""
The office of Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said that Barnett, who had been living in Louisiana after retiring from Boeing, died ""from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""
Charleston police say detectives are actively investigating the case and are awaiting a formal cause of death as they try to determine the circumstances surrounding Barnett's death.
Barnett, who spent decades working for Boeing at its plants in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C., had repeatedly alleged that Boeing's manufacturing practices had declined — and that rather than improve them, he added, managers had pressured workers not to document potential defects and problems.
Barnett, 62, made international headlines in April of 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees spoke to The New York Times about what he called shoddy manufacturing problems at Boeing. Barnett accused the company of adopting a culture that prioritized raw numbers and profits over quality — and by extension, passenger safety.
""As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,"" Barnett told the newspaper. ""And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy.""
By the time the article appeared, Barnett had already filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing, saying that his attempts to raise quality and safety problems had been ignored and that he was punished for continuing to flag them.

Their comments highlight how Boeing's top buyers have felt the effects of its problems: snowballing quality control issues, a slow increase of output and certification of new aircraft that is running years behind schedule.
Southwest Airlines, which only flies Boeing 737s, trimmed its 2024 capacity forecast and said it was reevaluating its 2024 financial guidance, citing fewer Boeing deliveries than it previously expected this year: 46 Boeing 737 Max planes, down from 79.
""Boeing needs to become a better company and the deliveries will follow that,"" Southwest Airlines CEO Bob Jordan said at a JPMorgan industry conference Tuesday.
Alaska Airlines said Tuesday that its 2024 capacity estimates are ""in flux due to uncertainty around the timing of aircraft deliveries as a result of increased Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Justice scrutiny on Boeing and its operations.""
United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said at the JPMorgan conference on Tuesday that the carrier has asked Boeing to stop building Max 10 planes for the airline, an aircraft that hasn't yet been certified by the FAA, and produce more Max 9s, which are flying already.
""It's impossible to say when the Max 10 is going to get certified,"" Kirby said. In January, Kirby said the airline would build a fleet plan without the Max 10 because of the delays.
On Friday, United told staff that it would have to pause pilot hiring this spring because new Boeing planes are arriving late, CNBC reported.
The frustration from airline bosses has been building in recent months since Boeing's latest crisis stemmed from a door panel that blew out midair from a Max 9 plane during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. The accident ramped up scrutiny on Boeing, and a preliminary National Transportation Safety Board investigation said bolts on the door panel didn't appear to be attached when the planes left the company's factory in Washington state.
""We are squarely focused on implementing changes to strengthen quality across our production system and taking the necessary time to deliver high quality airplanes that meet all regulatory requirements,"" Boeing said in an emailed statement. ""We continue to stay in close contact with our valued customers about these issues and our actions to address them.""
The FAA has halted Boeing's planned output increases and said a recent audit ""identified non-compliance issues in Boeing's manufacturing process control, parts handling and storage, and product control.""
Boeing's CEO, Dave Calhoun, and other leaders have vowed to stamp out quality control problems, and have been holding a number of work pauses to discuss issues with workers.
On Tuesday, Stan Deal, Boeing's commercial airplanes' unit CEO, told staff that the company would work with employees who have been found to have noncompliant issues during the audit to make sure they ""fully understand the work instructions and procedures"" and implement weekly compliance checks, and plan for more audits this month.
In a note to staff, Deal said employees must ""precisely follow every step of our manufacturing procedures and processes"" and ""always be on the lookout for a potential safety hazard,"" telling employees ""you are fully empowered to report it through your manager or the Speak Up portal, so we address it right away rather than travel the risk to the next person or position.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/boeing-max-problems-shift-growth-plans-at-southwest-united.html

The news was first reported on Saturday by The Wall Street Journal, saying the DOJ has contacted some passengers who were on the flight to notify them that they are potential victims in the criminal investigation, and that the agency has interviewed pilots and flight attendants who were on the flight.
“In an event like this, it’s normal for the DOJ to be conducting an investigation,” Alaska Airlines said in a statement, adding that it is “fully cooperating and [we] do not believe we are a target of the investigation.”
Both the Justice Department and Boeing said they had no comment on The Wall Street Journal report about the investigation.
On Jan. 5, Flight 1282 departed Portland International Airport for Ontario International Airport in San Bernardino County, California, but turned back after a portion of the plane’s fuselage, known as a “door plug,” detached shortly after takeoff. No one on board was seriously injured and the plane landed safely, but officials cautioned that the situation could have been “much more tragic.”
The incident prompted the temporary grounding of some Boeing 737 Max 9 airplanes. Planes have since returned to service.
An investigation led by the National Transportation Safety Board preliminarily found there were no bolts installed on the door plug.
According to The Wall Street Journal, investigators are looking into whether Boeing complied with a settlement following the 2018 and 2019 737 Max 8 crashes that claimed the lives of 346 people.
The DOJ ultimately placed blame on Boeing in those cases, which in turn blamed two former pilots who determined the amount of training needed to fly the Max planes.
Boeing was ordered to pay $2.5 billion to settle the investigation in 2021, and the government said it would drop a charge of conspiracy to defraud the U.S. after three years if Boeing followed the terms of the settlement.
According to The Wall Street Journal, Boeing could face prosecution on the original count of defrauding the U.S. if, in this new case, the DOJ finds Boeing is at fault of violating the terms of the 2021 settlement. The government could also extend a three-year probationary agreement requiring Boeing to keep the DOJ updated on compliance improvements, the Journal reported.
Following the January Alaska Airlines incident, a number of passengers filed suit against the airline and Boeing.
In the days following the blowout, seven passengers filed a class-action lawsuit against Boeing, alleging the company “delivered the subject 737 MAX-9 to Alaska Airlines, Inc. without properly securing the [door] plug to the airframe,” or because the bolts and seals used to install the panel were defective.
In February, three passengers filed a $1 billion lawsuit against Alaska Airlines and Boeing, accusing the companies of negligence and alleging they ignored warning signs that could have prevented the door plug fiasco.
Jonathan Johnson, a lawyer representing those passengers, said in a Saturday statement, “We are pleased that DOJ has opened this investigation to help determine why this plane was not properly manufactured.”
He added that he hopes “those responsible will be held accountable.”
This week, the Federal Aviation Administration said an audit of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems — which made the plane at the center of January’s incident — “found multiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/justice-department-investigating-door-plug-blowout-alaska-airlines-fli-rcna142629

Passengers were met by paramedics when the LATAM Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner touched down in Auckland. It was not immediately clear what caused the incident.
About 50 people were treated at the scene, mostly for mild injuries. Twelve were taken to hospital, an ambulance spokesperson said, with one believed to be in serious condition.
It is been a turbulent week for Boeing, with the US plane maker suffering a series of safety-related issues.
On March 4, an engine fire forced a Boeing 737 to make an emergency landing in Houston, Texas shortly after takeoff. United Airlines said the engine ingested some plastic bubble wrap that was on the airfield prior to departure.
Two days later, fumes in the cabin of a Boeing 737-800 forced an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon.
On Thursday, a tyre fell off a Boeing 777-200 after takeoff in San Francisco, destroying a car. The plane was bound for Japan but diverted to Los Angeles where it landed safely.
A day later, a Boeing 737 MAX rolled off the runway in Houston and got stuck in grass.
The events this week come as the US plane maker is still reeling from a near catastrophic incident in January when a fuselage panel on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 Alaska Airlines jet blew off mid-flight.
In the incident on Monday, passengers arriving in Aukland told local media that the plane quickly lost altitude, flinging those unsecured towards the ceiling.
A passenger told radio network RNZ that “people flew through the air because they weren’t wearing their seatbelts”.
“Some people got pretty injured. People were really scared as well” the man said, his voice shaking.

But he didn’t show up.
When his legal team called him repeatedly to no avail, they eventually asked the hotel he was staying at to check in on him. That’s when Barnett was found dead in his truck in the parking lot.
The Charleston County Coroner’s Office told TIME that Barnett died from “what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” and that the Charleston Police Department is continuing to investigate the death.
Barnett’s lawyer Brian Knowles described the discovery as “tragic” to legal newsletter Corporate Crime Reporter, which first reported on Barnett’s death. “John had been back and forth for quite some time getting prepared,” said Knowles, who told Corporate Crime Reporter that he was set to cross-examine Barnett on Saturday for what would have been “day three of his deposition here in Charleston on his AIR21 case,” referring to the shorthand for the Federal Aviation Administration’s Whistleblower Protection Program.
Barnett, who was based in Louisiana, was in South Carolina to offer evidence for legal proceedings linked to a defamation lawsuit against Boeing, which he claimed deliberately hurt his career and reputation because of allegations he’d made of grave safety breaches on the aircraft company’s production line.
“John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end,” Knowles and his co-counsel Robert Turkewitz said in a statement to TIME. “He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.”
The lawyers described Barnett as “a brave, honest man of the highest integrity” who “cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft.” They said they were devastated about his death and urged a full and accurate investigation. “We need more information about what happened to John,” they said. “No detail can be left unturned.”
Rodney Barnett, John Barnett’s brother, told the Associated Press that John “was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death.”
In a one-sentence statement to TIME, Boeing said: “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”
The 62-year-old, who had worked at Boeing for over three decades as a quality control engineer and manager until his retirement in 2017, has for the past few years been outspoken about his skepticism of the company’s safety standards, which have come under heightened scrutiny in recent months amid a series of high-profile malfunctions on Boeing planes.
In 2019, just months after an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 8 and a Lion Air Boeing 737 MAX both crashed minutes after takeoff, killing everyone on board, Barnett told the BBC that workers at one Boeing factory had been deliberately fitting faulty parts to planes to meet production deadlines, and that oxygen masks on the 787 Dreamliner had a 1-in-4 chance of failing during an emergency. Barnett said he had alerted Boeing managers as well as the FAA to the concerns but that no action had been taken. Boeing denied his allegations, though it acknowledged that an inspection in 2017 found that some oxygen bottles were in fact not deploying properly.
Barnett also told the New York Times in 2019 that he was once reprimanded for documenting “process violations” via email instead of face to face, which he took to mean the company didn’t want him putting problems in writing. In a 2014 performance review seen by the Times, Barnett’s manager told him that he had to improve at “working in the gray areas and help find a way while maintaining compliance.”
In January, the plane manufacturer made headlines again when an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 MAX 9 made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff in Portland after one of its emergency exit doors blew out mid-air, causing passengers’ belongings to fly out of the hole and pressure on the plane to be destabilized. While no one was seriously hurt by the blowout, much of it thanks to luck—the seats nearest to the hole were unoccupied and most passengers were strapped in their seats when it happened—three passengers on the flight are suing the airline and Boeing for $1 billion, arguing that they’ve suffered severe psychological distress due to negligence.
Alaska Airlines temporarily grounded its fleet of Boeing 737-9 planes immediately after the accident and greenlit them to fly again just weeks later. But Barnett told TMZ at the time that Boeing’s troubles weren’t isolated to one door plug—or one plane.
“This is not a 737 problem, this is a Boeing problem,” he said, adding that Boeing started removing inspection operations in 2012. “What we’re seeing with the door plug blowout is what I’ve seen with the rest of the airplane as far as jobs not being completed properly, inspection steps being removed, issues being ignored.”
Controversy surrounding the Alaska Airlines incident is still mounting, with the Wall Street Journal reporting last week that the Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into the case. And Boeing, which was accused of not being cooperative with federal investigators, admitted to Congress on Friday that it could not find records on the exploded door panel.
The FAA said earlier this month that a six-week audit of Boeing and subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems in the wake of the Alaska Airlines incident “found multiple instances where the companies allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.”
On Monday, more than 50 passengers were injured after a LATAM Airlines Boeing 787 bound for New Zealand from Australia plummeted mid-air, throwing passengers out of their seats, in what the carrier said was a “technical event” and is now under investigation.
As its reputation has sunk, so has Boeing’s stock price—dropping by more than 26% since the start of the year, per NASDAQ.
“Once you understand what’s happening inside of Boeing, you’ll see why we’re seeing these kinds of issues,” Barnett told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in January.

John Barnett was found dead of a ""self-inflicted"" gunshot wound, police said.
A former Boeing employee who raised numerous concerns about the company's production standards died from a ""self-inflicted"" gunshot wound Saturday, per a coroner's report. The former employee was actively engaged in a whistleblower complaint against the company prior to his death, the employee's attorney confirmed.
John Barnett, 62, was found by police officers on the morning of March 9 in a vehicle parked at a Holiday Inn along Savannah Highway ""holding a silver hand gun in his right hand,"" according to the Charleston Police Department.
Police said they were responding to a hotel worker's call after the worker heard a ""pop"" from Barnett's vehicle about 30 minutes prior to officers arriving, per the police report. Barnett had checked into the hotel on March 2 and was due to check out on March 8.
Responding officers discovered a male inside a vehicle ""suffering from a gunshot wound to the head,"" the incident report reads. ""He was pronounced deceased at the scene.""
The Charleston Police Department said the investigation is still active.
Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years until his retirement in 2017. He had been actively involved in litigation against the company -- he was deposed before Boeing lawyers last week, according to his lawyer.
Barnett filed his whistleblower complaint shortly after his retirement from Boeing in 2017. He came forward publicly in 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees partook in interviews with The New York Times. Barnett and others accused Boeing of prioritizing profits over safety.
""John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end,"" Barnett's attorneys, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, said in a statement Tuesday. ""He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.""
Boeing has moved to dismiss the case on several occasions and has denied all of Barnett's allegations – including claims the company put profits over safety. “Safety issues are immediately investigated, and changes are made wherever necessary,” said a Boeing spokesperson at the time of his lawsuit.
Upon learning of Barnett's passing, Boeing released a statement: ""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""
The news follows the completion of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) audit of Boeing's production lines after a Boeing 737 MAX 9 plane lost its door plug mid-flight earlier this year.
The New York Times reported Monday that Boeing failed 33 of 89 audits. Spirit Aerosystems -- a supplier for Boeing that manufactures the fuselage for the 737 -- failed 7 of 13 audits from the FAA.
In response to the results, Boeing said it will ""continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers.""

Now, new details emerging from a Federal Aviation Administration audit of the world’s second largest commercial aircraft manufacturer may run deeper than previously thought.
The six-week audit into Boeing and its 737 Max body supplier Spirit AeroSystems found “dozens” of quality control problems at production facilities, according to a slide presentation reviewed by The New York Times. In one case, mechanics working for Spirit were even observed using Dawn dish soap on a door seal in place of lubricant. The seal was then reportedly cleaned up with a “wet cheesecloth.” In another instance, Spirit mechanics were reportedly found using a hotel key card to check a door seal, which isn’t standard practice.
Overall, out of 89 product audits, Boeing managed to pass just 56 of them while failing 33, according to the report. Many of the problems at the Boeing facility, according to the slide presentation seen by the Times, involved the company not following “approved manufacturing process, procedure or instruction.” Others reportedly dealt with a lack of proper quality control documentation. Spirit received failing grades on seven audits and passing grades on six. At Boeing, six engineers averaged a poor score of just 58% on a test reportedly analyzing how well they understood their company’s quality-control processes.
FAA audit comes on the heels of multiple high-profile safety incidents
Boeing has received steady international attention for months following a spate of safety incidents, some of which have resulted in serious injuries. Just last week, a Boeing plane heading to Japan from San Francisco was diverted after a wheel reportedly detached from the jet mid-flight and landed in a parking lot, leaving several vehicles severely damaged. More recently, at least 50 people traveling on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner headed to Australia from New Zealand were injured after a “technical event” reportedly caused the plane to suddenly nosedive and sent some passengers hurling toward the aircraft’s ceiling. Thirteen of those passengers were transported to a nearby hospital. Another Boeing 737 Max departing from Houston was recently forced to land shortly after takeoff due to the engine reportedly sucking up plastic wrap left on the tarmac prior to departure.
The door plug blowout which ultimately sparked the major FAA audit resulted in an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board which claimed four bolts were missing from the door plug prior to its breach. Three passengers onboard the Alaskan Airlines flight at the time are suing the airline and Boeing for $1 billion over claims the companies acted negligently. Now, the Department of Justice is getting involved with its own criminal investigation.
This week, a former Boeing quality manager turned whistleblower named John Barnett was reportedly found dead in Charleston, South Carolina, from what the Charleston county coroner’s office said appeared to be a self-inflicted wound. The former employee, who worked in Boeing’s Charleston facility for 32 years, previously alleged time-crunched workers had fitted sub-standard parts to some Boeing 787 Dreamliner models. Barnett had filed whistleblower complaints alleging Boeing retaliated against him following his statements, a claim Boeing has denied.
Boeing faces multiple federal investigations
In a statement sent to PopSci, the FAA said its audit of Boeing’s production lines went “above and beyond [the administration’s] standard inspection process.” The findings, which are part of a larger ongoing investigation, revealed non-compliance issues in Boeing’s manufacturing process, parts handling, and product control. The FAA did not provide access to the full audit report but noted it will continue to have an increased onsite presence in Boeing and Spirit’s facilities in Renton, Washington, and Wichita, Kansas respectively.
“This won’t be back to business as usual for Boeing. They must commit to real and profound improvements,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker wrote in a statement. “Making foundational change will require a sustained effort from Boeing’s leadership, and we are going to hold them accountable every step of the way.”
Boeing acknowledged the FAA findings in a statement sent to PopSci and said the company was continuing to “implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality, and build the confidence of our customers and their passengers.” Spirit did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but a spokesperson for the company told the Times it was “reviewing all identified nonconformities for corrective action.”
“We are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn,” the Boeing spokesperson added.
The FAA recently gave Boeing a 90-day-deadline to present a plan for quality control improvements following a spate of potentially dangerous incidents. That ultimatum came around the same time an expert panel directed by Congress to review Boeing’s safety process reportedly found a “disconnect” between senior management and employees on issues revolving around the company’s safety culture. The panel report, Reuters notes, found a “lack of awareness of safety-related metrics at all levels of the organization.”
If confirmed, the FAA audit findings will likely add even more ammunition to critics who argue Boeing, once heralded for its expert engineering, has gained a reputation for cutting corners and short term profits over customer safety. Boeing fervently denied those accusations of a company wide shift, but the FAA audits shows the recent headline-grabbing events are, at the least, not one-off anomalies.",https://www.popsci.com/technology/boeing-faa-audit/

The modification is taking place in Palmdale, California, and ground and flight testing is expected to start in 2028. The aircraft was named X-66A by the US Air Force.
NASA will fund $425 million via milestone payments, and Boeing and its partners will contribute $725 million.
Boeing ferried an MD-90 to Palmdale, and it is being modified to test the Transonic Truss-Braced Wing (TTBW) configuration as part of NASA’s Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project.
With ultrathin wings braced by struts with larger spans and higher aspect ratios, a TTBW and other technical advances could reduce fuel burn and emissions by up to 30%.
Boeing and NASA collaborated on the concept for over a decade through the Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research (SUGAR) Program.
The MD-90 was equipped with IAE (Pratt & Whitney) V2500 engines, and the X-66A will use Pratt & Whitney GTF engines. The TTBW is optimized to fly at 0.8Mach, a typical airline’s “network speed.”
The 30% goal is an easy target. GTF fuel burn numbers among US airlines have already shown improvements of over 20%. This means the other technologies and the wing need to deliver 10%.
As Pratt & Whitney pushes for additional enhancements, exceeding the 30% goal is achievable. The project is helping NASA reach a goal of zero aviation emissions by 2050. “We at NASA are excited to be working with Boeing on the X-66A Sustainable Flight Demonstrator making critical contributions to accelerate aviation towards its 2050 net-zero greenhouse gas emission goal,” said Ed Waggoner, deputy associate administrator for programs in the NASA Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate.
A little ironic
Ironically, Boeing is using a McDonnell Douglas airplane as the base for the X-66A. The history of the two firms’ merger generated all sorts of commentary. In April 2023, NASA Administrator Bil Nelson described the X-66A as the precursor to replace the 737 MAX.
This irony aside, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said in November 2022 that there would be no new clean-sheet airplane this decade. Analysts’ reaction to this was not positive. In May 2023, at a media briefing before the Paris Air Show, Mr. Calhoun stated: “You have to be patient, you have to get ducks lined up, the technologies lined up and matured. Then whatever they cater to with respect to that next airplane, it’s got to be a big enough market to satisfy our investors. I really don’t want to get to that question until other things are ready.”
Some readers will nod, agreeing with the “satisfy our investors” statement, while others shake their heads in wonder. But let’s also put aside the well-trodden path and debate the focus on investors rather than customers.
Replacing the MAX
The critical issue is that the X-66A is essentially the testbed for replacing the 737 MAX. Airbus has signaled its thoughts about replacing the A320. Is the X-66A Boeing’s signal? If it is, Boeing is arguably ahead of Airbus because it has a physical experimental airplane. Mr. Calhoun’s statements then reflect these facts.
It is easy to argue that Boeing needs to “do something” about the MAX. The X-66A plausibly promises to deliver a step change in fuel burn improvements, with concomitant emission reductions.
Pratt & Whitney laid out its GTF technology plan in 2022 to provide at least 10% improved fuel burn by the decade’s end. The TTBW could house the CFM RISE engine, its high wing allowing space for the spinning blades. The TTBW potentially offers either engine. Either approach should offer double-digit improvements over current engines.
The TTBW offers high strength-to-weight ratios and benefits from the triangular structure. Airbus is using a different approach.
Boeing’s challenge is accelerating the X-66A program as it stabilizes the 737 MAX. In summary, even with the MAX challenges, Boeing has a promising replacement path.

“The 30% goal is an easy target. GTF fuel burn numbers among US airlines have already shown improvements of over 20%. This means the other technologies and the wing need to deliver 10%”.
The advancements of the GTF are already part of the todays State of the Art. The 30% goal should be beyond that which is already flying today on A320neo/737max, not compared to ceo/ng. So not such an easy target.",https://airinsight.com/the-irony-of-boeings-promising-x-66a/

- The instance was mentioned in a document discussing FAA audits of Boeing and its supplier, per NYT.
- This particular supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, is in charge of building the 737 Max's fuselage.
The Federal Aviation Administration auditors saw mechanics for a Boeing supplier using liquid Dawn soap as a lubricant for fitting a door seal, The New York Times reported.
The regulator then observed mechanics at Spirit AeroSystems, which builds the fuselage of Boeing's 737 Max, cleaning up using a wet cheesecloth, per The Times' Mark Walker.
These findings were part of a six-week audit documented in a set of FAA presentation slides upon which The Times based its report.
The slides said that Boeing had failed 33 of 89 product audits related to 737 Max production, while Spirit failed seven of 13 audits, per The Times.
Global scrutiny is building on the quality of the 737 Max's fuselage after a door plug on an Alaska Airlines flight blew out in January while the aircraft was still midair.
The incident triggered a push to investigate safety standards at Boeing, which had been accused of quality assurance lapses for several years.
The Times reported that most of the issues flagged by the FAA involved manufacturing staff not following approved procedures, while some involved issues with documenting quality control.
A note for the liquid soap incident said the door seal fitting instructions were ""vague and unclear on what specifications or actions are to be followed or recorded by the mechanic,'"" per The Times.
In response to The Times' report, Boeing told Business Insider in a statement that it would ""continue to implement immediate changes and develop a comprehensive action plan to strengthen safety and quality.""
""We are squarely focused on taking significant, demonstrated action with transparency at every turn,"" the statement said.
A spokesperson for Spirit told The Times the firm is ""reviewing all identified nonconformities for corrective action.""
In an email to BI, Spirit spokesperson Joe Buccino said the company would work with Boeing to address the issues found in the FAA's special audit.
""Meanwhile, we continue multiple efforts undertaken to improve our safety and quality programs. These improvements focus on human factors and other steps to minimize nonconformities,"" it said.
The Times' report comes after the FAA said in late February that it had found quality control issues at Boeing, and gave the aviation company 90 days to submit a plan for fixing these problems.
In response, Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun said the company plans to follow through with the FAA's demands. ""We have a clear picture of what needs to be done,"" he said.

While the FAA had previously described “systemic” issues discovered by the audit, a report by the New York Times revealed further information about the problems uncovered, including the use of liquid dish soap as a temporary lubricant on a door seal.
Investigators also reportedly saw a mechanic at Spirit use a hotel key card to test a door seal and said instructions were “vague and unclear” on what steps are to be taken or recorded by employees.
Boeing has been given 90 days to respond to the audit with an action plan, with CEO Dave Calhoun saying that the company has a “clear picture of what needs to be done” to address concerns about its quality control.
The details of the FAA’s audit are the latest in a long list of criticisms mounted at Boeing in the aftermath of the blow out incident, including an investigation by the US Department of Justice and another report by the FAA that found the implementation of safety culture at the manufacturer to be “inadequate”.

Whistleblower death
Separately, the manufacturer has also expressed sadness at the death of a former employee who had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against Boeing after he expressed concern the assembly process for new aircraft was being rushed.
John Barnett, a former quality manager for Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner programme in North Charleston, South Carolina, was found with “self-inflicted” wounds in a hotel car park. He had failed to appear in court for cross-examination as part of his lawsuit alleging denigration of his character by his former employer.
Barnett previously revealed concerns about sub-standard parts being fitted to aircraft on the Boeing production line, including oxygen systems that allegedly could have meant a quarter of breathing masks on an aircraft would not have worked in an emergency.
Boeing had denied Barnett’s claims, including that no action had been taken after he alerted managers of his concerns, but a review by the FAA in 2017 upheld some of his claims such as that some defective parts went missing in the factory.",https://www.airport-technology.com/news/faa-737max-audit-fails-boeing-processes/

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC/AP) - The attorneys of a former Boeing employee who raised concerns about the company’s production standards have released a statement as an investigation into his death this weekend continues.
John Barnett, 62, from Louisiana was found dead in his vehicle outside a Charleston hotel on Saturday morning. Barnett, who worked for Boeing for 32 years, filed a whistleblower complaint alleging safety concerns. The United States Department of Labor was working through the discovery phase of its investigation and is set to begin hearings on that complaint this June.
Barnett’s attorneys, Robert police of the Law Office of Robert M. Turkewitz, LLC and Brian Knowles of Knowles Law Firm, PC, released the following statement Tuesday afternoon:
John was a brave, honest man of the highest integrity. He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft. We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character.
In the course of his job as a quality manager at Boeing South Carolina, John learned of and exposed very serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment, which is the subject of his pending AIR-21 case.
John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end. He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.
We are all devasted. We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.
Hotel employee discovered Barnett after welfare check requested
Police confirmed Barnett was found in his orange 2015 Dodge Ram truck dead from a gunshot wound to the head Saturday morning. Police were sent to the Holiday Inn on Savannah Highway shortly before 10:20 a.m. to perform a welfare check, Sgt. Anthony Gibson said. An incident report states a friend named Rob, who has been confirmed as Rob Turkewitz one of Barnett’s attorneys, called the hotel to request that they check on Barnett.
Hotel employees knocked on the door to his hotel room but after they did not get an answer, they checked the parking lot for the vehicle the friend described and made the discovery, the report states.
Barnett’s truck was in the hotel’s back parking lot, an incident report states. An orange truck was located Tuesday at an impound lot in North Charleston. The woman working the counter said the truck had Louisiana plates and was the subject of a police hold.
Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O’Neal said Barnett died Saturday “from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.” Police said Barnett had a silver handgun in his right hand with his finger still on the trigger and had suffered an apparent gunshot wound to his right temple.
An employee told police they heard a “pop” sound near the car less than an hour before police arrived, but the employee said they didn’t think anything of it. Police also noted there was a white piece of paper “resembling a note” on the passenger seat of that car.
The report did not specify the contents of the note, but Dr. Kenny Kinsey, a criminal justice expert who testified during the Alex Murdaugh murder trial, said that depending on what police found, it could either mean the end of the investigation or just the beginning.
“Detectives are actively investigating this case and are awaiting the formal cause of death, along with any additional findings that might shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barnett,” Sgt. Anthony Gibson said in a statement. “We understand the global attention this case has garnered, and it is our priority to ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence.”
Family: Barnett suffered from PTSD, anxiety after working for company
Barnett retired from Boeing back in 2017. He worked at Boeing’s North Charleston location from 2010 until his retirement. Barnett’s wife, Diane Johnson, who died in November of 2022, worked for Boeing for 28 years.
He reportedly alerted managers about the company using sub-standard parts and oxygen systems with serious problems on several occasions. Those managers allegedly took no action to fix the issues and Boeing denied Barnett’s claims, the BBC reported.
Barnett was a longtime Boeing employee and worked as a quality-control manager before he retired in 2017. In the years after that, he shared his concerns with journalists.
“John was deeply concerned about the safety of the aircraft and flying public, and had identified some serious defects that he felt were not adequately addressed,” Barnett’s brother, Rodney, said in a family statement to The Associated Press on Tuesday. “He said that Boeing had a culture of concealment and was putting profits over safety.”
Rodney Barnett said working at Boeing created stress for John.
“He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death,” the brother said.
Boeing, in a one-sentence statement, said, “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”
In 2019, Barnett told The New York Times about quality issues at Boeing’s factory in South Carolina, where the 787 jetliner is assembled.
Barnett said he found discarded metal shavings near wiring for the flight controls. He said it could have been “catastrophic” if the sharp pieces had pierced the wiring. He said after he complained to superiors, they moved him to another part of the plant.
Barnett told the BBC that same year that up to a quarter of the oxygen systems on the 787 – a two-aisle plane that airlines use mostly for international flights – might not work because of faulty parts installed at the Boeing plant. Boeing denied the claim.
Whistleblower complaint set to be heard in June
The United States Department of Labor set a schedule for a hearing of Barnett’s whistleblower complaint, according to documents.
Barnett was in the midst of giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against Boeing, the BBC reported.
On several occasions, Barnett reported about the company using sub-standard parts, and oxygen systems with serious problems. Barnett reportedly alerted managers who took no action to fix the issues.
Boeing denied Barnett’s claims.
Barnett filed a complaint on Jan. 16, 2017, with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging Boeing retaliated against him in violation of the Employee Protection Provisions Act.
Barnett claims Boeing subjected him to a hostile work environment for engaging in whistleblower-protected activity, which caused severe stress that led Barnett to take medical leave and early retirement.
Boeing tried to dismiss Barnett’s claims, arguing he did not present facts sufficient to prove his claims. But the judge denied Boeing’s partial motion to dismiss on March 31, 2022.
On Nov. 14, 2023, Barnett filed a motion to compel discovery, a move to ask the court to enforce a request for information relevant to a case.
Court documents state Boeing’s efforts to identify records of other complaints made by other employees at the South Carolina location of adverse actions taken in response to reports of safety or quality violations are woefully lacking. The judge adds that Boeing has had the requests for over a year.
The judge ruled on Dec. 21, 2023, that Boeing must produce the documents sought by Barnett.
The discovery phase was set to be completed by March 30 with a formal hearing set to take place during the week of June 24, documents from the Department of Labor state.
The formal hearing was scheduled for 9 a.m. from June 24-28 in Charleston.
It’s unclear where the case now stands.
EDITOR’S NOTE: An earlier version of this story stated that police discovered Barnett’s body after receiving a welfare check. The incident report adds that the hotel received the call requesting a welfare check and that a hotel employee eventually checked the parking lot for Barnett’s vehicle, discovered him inside and called police. Police then responded to the hotel.

OAKLAND, Calif. - Since the Alaska Airlines door-plug blowout on January 5, Boeing's stock has nose-dived 26%; a $30 billion loss to shareholders and a cratering of its reputation.
If it was school, Boeing gets a D- and its supplier both got a grade of F.
The Federal Aviation Administration says Boeing failed 33 of 89 audits of its manufacturing and quality control processes. Its door plug supplier, the device that blew out on January 5, failed 7 of 13 audits.
""Well, that's a high failure rate,"" said international aviation attorney Mary Schiavo, who is a former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation that oversees the FAA which, in turn, oversees Boeing and the airline industry.
""They also have to see that Boeing is doing all of the assembly in the exact and precise steps and procedure that are approved,"" said Schiavo.
Anonymous via FOX News
Documentation of how the door plug was installed is missing or never existed. ""Requiring that documentation is part of the certification process,"" said Schiavo.
She also says that the FAA may soon find itself under investigation. ""Did the FAA do everything it was supposed to do with overseeing Boeing? Has the government been robust enough in its oversight,"" said the aviation attorney.
A few years ago, in the wake of two 737 crashes that killed 346 people, to avoid criminal prosecution for those crashes. Boeing agreed not to mislead, deceive or defraud the FAA. That's why Boeing is under criminal investigation. Since the day of the Alaska Airlines door blowout, stock in Boeing, the nation's largest exporter, has dropped 26%.
Some experts say that intense competition, aircraft demand, shareholder expectations and far too much self-certification have led to this. ""I think it's unacceptable,"" said frequent flyer Chris Meyers. ""It's a huge loss of confidence,"" said his wife Amada.
They say its unsettling scary ""You get on the plane thinking that steps have been taken and the maintenance is done and everybody is taking ownership of everybody's safety,"" said Meyers. ""Then the event happened and was like, OK, that's one of those freak accidents. You isolate your mind thinking it won't happen again,"" said Meyers.

John Barnett, who worked as a quality manager at Boeing for 32 years, died from “what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” according to the Charleston County Coroner's Office. Authorities are investigating his death.
Since Barnett left the company, Boeing has changed its internal reporting practices, introducing a ‘Speak Up’ policy to encourage employees to report faults in the manufacturing process.
However, a recent Expert Panel Review report revealed that Boeing has failed to make this system work in a way that assures employees their voices are heard and that there will be no retaliation for raising quality concerns.
A Vocal Quality Control Whistleblower
Barnett had publicly raised multiple safety concerns about Boeing’s quality practices at its 787 plant in North Charleston, South Carolina and was vocal in his criticism of the company’s safety culture.
In January of this year, he spoke with TMZ to share his views on the 737-9 MAX Alaska Airlines

Best 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024
He also told ABC News Australia this January that Boeing’s “culture is all about speed and production and getting airplanes out the door. And any issues, any concerns that you bring up are going to slow them down.”
Barnett spoke to the BBC in 2019, claiming there were faults with the emergency oxygen system on the 787 Dreamliner. He also claimed the company pushed production, leading to quality gaps and losing control of non-conforming parts, which meant some could have been used in production.
A Tragic Day
Barnett’s lawyer in the lawsuit, Brian Knowles, described the whistleblower’s death as “a tragic day.”
Barnett was due to complete the third day of his deposition in Charleston on his AIR21 case. Federal law AIR21 protects aviation industry employees as whistleblowers.
The defense examined Barnett for seven hours on Thursday, and his attorney cross-examined him on Friday but had yet to conclude the process. Barnett was due to continue his cross-examination on Saturday at 10 a.m. but did not appear, and his phone went to voice mail.
“We then asked the hotel to check on him. They found him in his truck dead from an ‘alleged’ self-inflicted gunshot. We drove to the hotel and spoke with the police and the coroner,” Knowles said in an email to the Corporate Crime Reporter.
Boeing told the BBC after Barnett’s death, “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”
Critical Of Boeing Charleston Plant Leadership
John Barnett was a quality manager at Boeing in Everett, Washington, for 28 years before transferring to Boeing’s plant in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2010, the final assembly line for the 787 Dreamliner program. Barnett was critical of the leadership at the North Charleston plant.
“They started pressuring us to not document defects, to work outside the procedures, to allow defective material to be installed without being corrected,” he told the Corporate Crime Reporter in 2019. “They started bypassing procedures and not maintaining configurement control of airplanes, not maintaining control of non conforming parts – they just wanted to get the planes pushed out the door and make the cash register ring.”
Barnett’s AIR21 Filing Against Boeing
Barnett’s last years at Boeing were conflicted. He unsuccessfully filed multiple internal complaints about process gaps, which he felt went nowhere.
Barnett followed the internal process to raise concerns at Boeing. “I filed the ethics complaints. I went to leadership. I wrote an email to the vice president of Boeing ethics in Washington, D.C. I sent her an email and said – I need help. I’m being harassed and blacklisted,” he said in his 2019 interview with the Corporate Crime reporter. “And she wrote back and said – we will look into your complaint.”
Barnett had asked that Boeing personnel outside of Charleston investigate his complaints and was assured that the company would.
“Within a couple of days, it was turned over to the human resources rep that should have been under investigation. And they gave it to her to investigate,” he said. “Not surprisingly, she closed it out very quickly saying she couldn’t substantiate my complaint.”
Following health concerns and suffering anxiety attacks, Barnett left Boeing in 2017 and filed an AIR21 complaint against the company. “I listed safety items I had identified, the hostility and denigration and being black listed and blackballed from other jobs,” he said.
Expert Review Panel Finds ‘Fear of Retaliation’ In Boeing’s ‘Speak Up’ Program
Boeing established the ‘Speak Up’ program in 2019 to support internal reporting as the company tries to foster a positive safety culture.
However, the Expert Review Panel found that ‘Speak Up’ is still perceived within Boeing “as a new reporting program” under the Safety Management System. The Expert Panel also found that the company failed to create a culture where internal complaints are adequately recognized without fear of retaliation.
“The Expert Panel learned managers that are authorized to oversee employee performance evaluations, salary decisions, promotions, and disciplinary actions might also be tasked with investigative duties in the SMS framework. This arrangement could lead to a manager investigating a report within their own reporting chain, potentially compromising Boeing’s commitment to a non-retaliatory and impartial environment. This dual responsibility and authority create, among some employees, hesitation in reporting safety concerns for fear of retaliation,” the Expert Panel wrote in its 50-page report on Boeing’s safety management system.
Furthermore, the Expert Panel said it “could not identify a consistent and clear safety reporting channel or process within the business unit, nor a successful process in which the employee is informed of the outcome of the report. Employees did not understand how to utilize the different reporting systems, which reporting system to use and when. Employees also preferred to avoid all reporting systems, including Speak Up, and favored to report issues to their manager. The Expert Panel is concerned that this confusion about reporting systems may discourage employees from submitting safety concerns.”
While Boeing’s SMS lists ‘Speak Up’ as the best way for employees to report concerns, the Expert Panel noted: “Employee interviews revealed distrust in the anonymity of the Speak Up program, which questions the effectiveness of this reporting program. Ultimately, employees prefer to report safety issues to their managers. The Expert Panel also found that employees who submit a report are not consistently informed of the outcome of their report.”
Responding to the Expert Panel Review report in February, Boeing issued a statement affirming its commitment to turn the situation around.
“We transparently supported the panel’s review and appreciate their work,” Boeing stated. “We’ve taken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do. We will carefully review the panel’s assessment and learn from their findings, as we continue our comprehensive efforts to improve our safety and quality programs.”",https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/03/12/boeings-flawed-speak-up-policy-and-the-death-of-a-whistleblower/

Police arrested five pro-Palestinian protesters on felony obstruction of justice charges after they blocked roads leading to the Boeing plant in Heath.
Heath Police Chief David Harin said the department received its first calls about the protesters at about 4 a.m. Monday. The protesters chanted ""free Palestine"" and blocked two bridges near the plant at 801 Irving Wick Drive West, Harin said.
Harin added that they tied themselves to disabled vehicles blocking the roadways. The chief could estimate the number of protesters but said numerous people were involved in the effort.
Heath Fire Chief Warren McCord said it took firefighters more than two hours to separate two people from a singular vehicle. He declined to say how the two people latched themselves to the vehicle or what crews did to separate them, citing the ongoing investigation. But McCord added that the firefighters had to cut off the car's roof.
McCord said two other people used rope to tie and suspend themselves from nearby bridges, with one person tied to the Aerospace Drive bridge and the other person connected to the James Parkway bridge.
Police cleared the roads by about 8:20 a.m., Harin said. The police department is working with prosecutors to determine whether additional charges were warranted.
A group known as Midwest Direct Action took credit for the protest on Instagram. The group wrote that dozens of activists were involved in the protest and had blocked three entrances to the Boeing facility.
In the post, the group called on Boeing, a leading arms manufacturer, to end any contracts tied to the ongoing conflict in Gaza.
""The action calls attention to Boeing's complicity in (genocide) and aims to send a strong message to the company that people will not stand idly by while the atrocities of the so-called state of 'Israel' are being committed,"" the group wrote in a post.
The group also called on supporters to send money for bail via Venmo.
In 2023, the U.S. Air Force selected the Boeing plant in Heath as a prime contractor for the nation's intercontinental ballistic missile guidance subsystem support. The award was part of a 16-year, $1.6 billion contract, with work primarily being done in Heath and Ogden, Utah.

Lawyers for the Boeing employee-turned-whistleblower found dead by apparent suicide have hailed him as ""a brave, honest man of the highest integrity"".
Authorities are currently investigating the death of John Barnett, from what appeared to be a self-inflicted wound.
Mr Barnett retired after working more than 30 years at Boeing in 2017. He was giving evidence in a lawsuit against the company before his death.
Two of his attorneys called on police to fully investigate how he had died.
""John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end,"" Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles said in a statement to the BBC.
""He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.""
Calling on officials in Charleston, South Carolina to provide more information about what happened, they wrote: ""No detail can be left unturned.""
Mr Turkewitz and Mr Knowles added that Mr Barnett was somebody who ""cared dearly"" about his family, his friends and Boeing, from its pilots to its customers.
From 2010 until his retirement on health grounds, Mr Barnett worked as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant making the 787 Dreamliner, a state-of-the-art airliner used mainly on long-haul routes.
In that job, he ""learned of and exposed very serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment"", his lawyers said.
After retiring, he embarked on a long-running legal action against the company.
He accused it of denigrating his character and hampering his career because of the issues he pointed out - charges rejected by Boeing.
At the time of his death, Mr Barnett had been in Charleston for legal interviews linked to that case and he gave a formal deposition last week in which he was questioned by Boeing's lawyers, before being cross-examined by his own counsel.
He had been due to undergo further questioning on Saturday. When he did not appear, enquiries were made at his hotel.
He was subsequently found dead in his truck in the hotel car park.
Taking on his long-time employer had caused Mr Barnett to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and his health had been in decline, his brother told US media.
""He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death,"" Rodney Barnett said.
Mr Barnett added that his brother ""was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture"".
The quality manager was known for raising concerns about the US plane giant's production standards, telling the BBC in 2019 that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He later told the BBC that workers had failed to follow procedures intended to track components through the factory, allowing defective components to go missing.
He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency.
He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.
Mr Barnett said he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action had been taken.
Boeing denied his assertions. However, a 2017 review by the US regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), did uphold some of Mr Barnett's concerns.
It established that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts in the factory was unknown, and that they were considered lost.
On the oxygen cylinders issue, the company said that in 2017 it had ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly"". But it denied that any of them were actually fitted on aircraft.
Mr Barnett's death comes at a time when production standards at both Boeing and its key supplier Spirit Aerosystems are under intense scrutiny.
Last week, the FAA said a six-week audit of the company had found ""multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements"".

John Barnett died on Saturday from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to officials in Charleston, South Carolina.
The Charleston police department is investigating. “We understand the global attention this case has garnered, and it is our priority to ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence,” it said.
Barnett, 62, retired in 2017 after almost three decades at Boeing. After finding clusters of metal slivers hanging over flight control wiring on several planes, Barnett said he urged his bosses to remove them. Instead, they moved him to another part of the company’s plant in North Charleston.
After filing a whistleblower complaint with regulators, Barnett made his concerns public in 2019, when he was one of several whistleblowers featured in a New York Times story about concerns over safety lapses at Boeing’s North Charleston site.
Boeing pushed back against his accounts.
“We are saddened by Mr Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,” the company said on Tuesday.
Boeing is now grappling with its biggest safety crisis since the crashes of two of its 737 Max 8 jets, in 2018 and 2019, in which 346 people were killed. A brand-new 737 Max 9 jet was forced into an emergency landing in January after a cabin panel blowout during an Alaska Airlines flight.
Regulators grounded 171 Max 9 aircraft for several weeks, and are still inspecting the planemaker’s production line. Boeing’s CEO, Dave Calhoun, has acknowledged the company faces a “serious challenge” to win back the confidence of officials and airlines.
Earlier this month, however, Jennifer Homendy, chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, revealed that Boeing had declined to tell investigators who worked on the door plug that blew off during the Alaska flight, and had yet to provide documentation about a repair job that included removing and reinstalling the panel.
“It’s absurd that two months later we don’t have that,” Homendy told a Senate committee. “Without that information, that raises concerns about quality assurance, quality management, safety management systems” at Boeing.
The company later stressed it had “deep respect” for the agency. “We have now provided the full list of individuals on the 737 door team, in response to a recent request,” Boeing said. “With respect to documentation, if the door plug removal was undocumented there would be no documentation to share.”
While concerns have focused on the Max program, an incident onboard a Boeing 787 this week has broadened scrutiny. The pilot of a Latam Airlines flight from Sydney to Auckland reportedly said he temporarily lost control of the jet amid a sudden drop that threw passengers around the cabin.
Brian Jokat, a passenger, told CNN he woke up as the plane “dropped something to the effect of 500 feet instantly”.
After landing, Jokat said the pilot told him that the gauges “went blank”, and that “for that brief moment he couldn’t control anything”, before the gauges returned and the flight continued as normal. At least 50 people are said to have been hurt, with 10 passengers and three cabin crew members taken to hospital.
Boeing said it is “in contact” with Latam and “stands ready” to support an investigation into what happened. “We are thinking of the passengers and crew from Latam Airlines Flight 800, and we commend everyone involved in the response effort.”

As an investigation gets underway to find out what went wrong on the LATAM Airlines flight from Sydney, Australia, to Auckland, New Zealand, that left 50 passengers injured on Monday, new details about another Boeing audit conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration reveal that the company failed large portions of that evaluation.
The audit specifically looked at the production of Boeing's 737 Max, following Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 from Portland, Oregon, to Ontario, California, in January, which was forced to make an emergency landing after a door plug suddenly blew out mid-air on a 737 Max 9 jet. Boeing failed 33 of the audit's 89 sections, CBS News confirmed, with regulators finding 97 examples of the company's alleged non-compliance with many of its own best practices.
The Alaska Airlines incident called into question the safety of the 737 Max 9 jet and Boeing's production standards more broadly, especially since preliminary results of an investigation by the National Transportation and Safety Board into the Alaska flight found that four key bolts meant to hold the door plug in place were missing from the aircraft. The probe so far indicates that the bolts holding that panel in place were not reinstalled during the plane's manufacturing process.
Both Alaska Airlines and United Airlines said later that they found loose hardware on 737 Max 9 aircrafts that were grounded in the wake of the door plug fiasco, and the FAA is conducting an ongoing investigation into Flight 1282 to determine exactly what happened, and whether Boeing ""failed to ensure"" that its aircrafts ""were in a condition for safe operation in compliance with FAA regulations.""
LATAM Airlines Flight 800 was a different Boeing aircraft model than the one used during the Alaska flight — the 787, which is considerably larger than the 737 Max 9. Compared with 174 passengers and six crew members on board the Alaska flight in January, the LATAM flight was carrying around 260 passengers and nine crew members when it abruptly dropped on its route to Auckland. The jolt sent some passengers hurtling into the aircraft's ceiling and left some bloodied. Around 50 passengers were hurt, and 13 were taken to hospitals for treatment after the plane landed.
LATAM said in a statement that the flight experienced technical issues that ""caused a strong movement"" of the aircraft.
""LATAM regrets the inconvenience and injury this situation may have caused its passengers, and reiterates its commitment to safety as a priority within the framework of its operational standards,"" the airline said.
New Zealand's Transport Accident Investigation Commission announced on Tuesday that it would seize the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder from the aircraft in hopes of learning more about what happened, but early reports suggest that the 787 plane's flight control system may have temporarily malfunctioned.
""The best way to describe it is, it dropped out of the air instantly,"" said Brian Jokat, a passenger on the LATAM flight. ""Then it started to tail down, like, nose down.""
Given the spate of recent aircraft incidents in the United States and worldwide, the union representing American Airlines pilots is now calling on the FAA to increase oversight of airlines and maintenance facilities. The U.S. Department of Justice has also launched a criminal investigation into Boeing, stemming from the Alaska Airlines flight, CBS News has learned.
Boeing declined to comment on the Justice Department probe, but indicated that it is cooperating with all ongoing investigations and making immediate changes to improve its quality control and safety.
The audit was first reported by The New York Times.
FAA Administrator Michael Whitaker said at a news briefing that the agency has ""dramatically increased"" oversight regarding ""the actual production"" of the Boeing 737 Max 9 jets and, for that reason, certifies the planes as safe now.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boeing-fails-large-portion-faa-audit-investigators-probe-new-zealand-787-incident/

The first piece of news hitting BA stock today involves a criminal investigation into the company. This is being headed by the U.S. Justice Department and has to do with a airplane door blowout earlier this year.
That blowout happened in early January and resulted in a large hole in a Boeing plane during an Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK) flight. The airline is cooperating with the investigation and says it doesn’t believe it is the “target of the investigation.”
Flight Issues Plague BA Stock
The next issue facing Boeing today concerns problems that cropped up during a Latam (OTCMKTS:LTMAY) flight. The airline noted that a technical problem resulted in serious movements mid-flight that sent some passengers out of their seats.
This issue resulted in dozens of people being examined for injuries after the flight. Most of them were minor, but one individual is in serious condition. That’s another black mark on BA stock today as the safety of its aircrafts becomes a concern for investors.
BA stock is down 3.8% as of Monday morning with some 5.6 million shares traded. The company’s daily average trading volume is about 9.5 million shares. The company’s shares are also down 24.2% since the start of the year.

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC/Gray News) - A former Boeing employee who raised concerns about the company’s production standards was found dead, according to the Charleston County Coroner’s Office.
John Barnett, 62, from Louisiana, was found dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Saturday, Chief Deputy Coroner Brittney Martin said.
“We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,” Boeing said in a statement.
Barnett had worked for Boeing for 32 years before retiring in 2017.
On several occasions, Barnett had reported about the company using sub-standard parts, and oxygen systems with serious problems. Barnett reportedly alerted managers who took no action to fix the issues and Boeing denied Barnett’s claims, according to reports.
The Charleston Police Department is investigating Barnett’s death.
Sgt. Anthony Gibson said officers responded to the Holiday Inn on Savannah Highway just before 10:20 a.m. Saturday.
Barnett was found inside a vehicle with a gunshot wound to the head, Gibson said.
He said detectives were awaiting a formal cause of death and any additional information about the circumstances around the death.
“We understand the global attention this case has garnered, and it is our priority to ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence,” Gibson said. “Given the sensitive nature of the investigation, we are unable to participate in media interviews at this time. This stance is not unique to this case but is a standard procedure we adhere to in order to preserve the integrity of active investigations.”

Barnett, 62, was supposed to be in a deposition Saturday to answer questions related to a lawsuit against his former employer when he failed to show up to the meeting. His legal team tried to reach him by phone to no avail, until they contacted the hotel where Barnett was staying.
He was found dead in his truck in the hotel parking lot.
The Charleston County Coroner’s Office told local media that it appears Barnett died from a self-inflicted wound. The Charleston Police Department is investigating his death.
Barnett, originally from Louisiana, was in Charleston for legal interviews related to his case against Boeing, in which he argued that his former employer retaliated against him for raising concerns about the safety of the airplanes produced at its Charleston manufacturing plant.
“Today is a tragic day,” Brian Knowles, Barnett’s lawyer, wrote in an email to Corporate Crime Reporter. “John had been back and forth for quite some time getting prepared. The defense examined him for their allowed seven hours under the rules on Thursday. I cross examined him all day yesterday (Friday) and did not finish. We agreed to continue this morning (Saturday) at 10 a.m., (co-counsel) Rob (Turkewitz) kept calling this morning and (Barnett’s) phone would go to voicemail. We then asked the hotel to check on him. They found him in his truck dead from an ‘alleged’ self-inflicted gunshot.”
Get breaking National news
Boeing stated that the company is “saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”
Barnett worked at Boeing for 32 years as a quality control engineer before retiring in 2017.
In 2019, along with a dozen other workers, Barnett told the New York Times that, facing manufacturing delays, Boeing pushed its workforce at the Charleston plant to churn out Dreamliners and ignore safety issues.
Barnett said at the time that he had discovered clusters of metal shavings hanging over wiring that commanded the flight controls in several planes. The metal shavings were apparently produced when fasteners were fitted into nuts, but if the shavings pierced the wires, the results would be “catastrophic.”
Barnett said he repeatedly urged his bosses to remove the shavings but they refused and moved Barnett to a different part of the Charleston plant.
A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed to the New York Times that it had inspected several Boeing planes and found the metal shavings, which can lead to electrical shorts and cause fires. The FAA issued a directive to have the shavings cleaned up and Boeing said at the time it was complying with the order and working to improve the design of the nut that produced the metal slivers.
Later in 2019, Barnett raised another safety concern, this time with the BBC. He said that procedures to track defective parts had failed, resulting in some sub-standard parts being fitted to planes to speed up manufacturing time.
He claimed that tests of the emergency oxygen systems on some planes had shown a failure rate of around 25 per cent, meaning that one in four oxygen masks deployed in the event of an emergency could fail.
Boeing denied the claims but the FAA found that at least 53 defective parts in the factory had gone missing and were considered lost. Boeing was ordered to take remedial actions following the report.
Barnett launched his own lawsuit against Boeing, accusing the company of defaming his character and hindering his career because of the safety issues he raised. This was the lawsuit Barnett was pursuing when he died.
In recent months, Boeing has consistently been in the headlines after a series of high-profile accidents.
In January, a door plug failed on a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane, resulting in a door panel blowing off the fuselage mid-flight. The blowout was linked to loose bolts and the FAA grounded all Boeing 737 Max 9 planes with a door plug shortly after the incident.
On Monday, 50 people were injured onboard a Boeing 787 plane after a “strong shake” and sudden plunge caused people to be thrown from their seats and hit the plane’s ceiling during a flight from Australia.
The cause of the “technical event” is still under investigation.

- John Barnett, 62, worked for over 30 years at Boeing, including as a quality manager at a 787 plant.
- Barnett was due to continue his deposition in a case against Boeing, his lawyer said.
A former Boeing manager who flagged concerns about the aircraft manufacturer's quality standards was found dead Saturday in South Carolina.
The body of John Barnett, 62, was found in his truck at a hotel car park in Charleston just days after he started giving a formal deposition in a legal action against Boeing, the BBC reported.
Barnett died from ""what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound,"" the Charleston County coroner's office told Business Insider in a statement. No further details were provided.
Boeing told BI in a statement: ""We are saddened by Mr Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""
Police are investigating Barnett's death. He worked for about 32 years at Boeing before retiring in 2017 and, for a time, was a quality manager at a North Charleston manufacturing plant for the 787 Dreamliner, the BBC reported in 2019.
At this post, Barnett said he observed worrying signs of slipping standards at Boeing, adding that the manufacturer was rushing to assemble its aircraft.
""I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy,"" Barnett told The New York Times in 2019.
That year, he told the BBC that a test in 2016 for 300 oxygen systems showed that one-quarter of them failed to deploy. Barnett also alleged that he knew of at least one case at the plant where workers used parts from scrap bins to fit planes on the production line.
In January, Barnett told TMZ there were cases in which inspectors were given only two hours to find defects in a supplier's products, significantly hampering their ability to conduct proper checks.
Boeing has denied Barnett's allegations and said that while it found some defective oxygen systems, as Barnett said, it removed them from production so they weren't deployed on any aircraft.
The Federal Aviation Administration visited the Charleston facility and found that more than 50 ""non-conforming"" parts were missing, appearing to add credibility to Barnett's claims of parts from scrap bins being used, per the BBC.
Barnett was due to continue deposition, lawyer says
Barnett filed an AIR21 case against Boeing, saying it undermined his career because he had raised safety concerns at the Charleston plant. The AIR21 is a law protecting airline-safety whistleblowers.
Barnett's lawyer, Brian Knowles, said the former Boeing manager was supposed to report Friday for the third day of his deposition, per the Corporate Crime Reporter, which first reported the news.
He was questioned by Boeing's lawyers Thursday and then cross-examined by Knowles on Friday but didn't show up or respond to calls on Saturday, Knowles said.
Barnett's lawyers asked his hotel to check on the whistleblower, and he was found dead in his vehicle, Knowles told the Corporate Crime Reporter. The BBC reported the same details surrounding Barnett's death.
In an email to BI, Knowles and his co-counsel Robert Turkewitz said Barnett had almost finished his deposition, ""was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on.""
""We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it,"" the lawyers' statement said.
Knowles and Turkewitz called on the Charleston police to fully investigate Barnett's death and reveal their findings to the public.
Boeing has, in recent months, come under scrutiny over safety concerns around its 737 Max planes after an Alaska Airlines flight in January had a door plug blown out of its fuselage while in the air.
The New York Times reported on Monday, citing a set of presentation slides, that Boeing had recently failed 33 out of 89 FAA product audits for its 737 Max production.
On Monday, at least 50 passengers were injured when a Boeing 787 Dreamliner run by Latam Airlines dropped suddenly because of a technical issue. The 787 is the aircraft that Barnett worked on at the North Charleston facility.

“Charleston City Police Department is the investigating agency. No further details are available at this time,” the office of Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O’Neal told Al Jazeera in a statement.
Brian Knowles and Robert Turkewitz, lawyers who represented Barnett, said their client had been in the midst of a deposition in a lawsuit against Boeing after suffering retaliation and a hostile work environment for exposing serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
“He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life,” Knowles and Turkewitz told Al Jazeera in a statement which described Barnett as a “brave, honest man of the highest integrity.”
“No one can believe it. We are all devasted. We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.”
Boeing, where Barnett worked for more than three decades until his retirement in 2017, expressed condolences at the news of his death.
“We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,” the Seattle-based aircraft manufacturer told Al Jazeera in a statement.
In 2019, Barnett was quoted by the BBC alleging that Boeing had deliberately fitted planes with faulty parts and that passengers on its 787 Dreamliner could be left without oxygen in the event of a sudden decompression.
Boeing denied Barnett’s claims at the time, insisting that it adhered to the highest safety standards.
In 2014, an Al Jazeera investigation released after the Dreamliner was briefly grounded following two battery failures revealed that workers at Boeing’s Charleston plant had serious concerns about the aircraft’s safety.
Boeing, which dominates the market for commercial aircraft along with Netherlands-based Airbus, has been under intense scrutiny over its safety record since two fatal crashes involving the Boeing 737 MAX in 2018 and 2019.
On Monday, dozens of people suffered injuries, most of them minor, when their Boeing aircraft en route to New Zealand from Australia experienced what airline officials described as a “strong movement” caused by a “technical event”.
The incident was the latest in a series of safety-related events since the beginning of March, including an engine fire that forced a Boeing 737 to make an emergency landing in Houston, Texas shortly after takeoff.
On Saturday, US media outlets reported that prosecutors had opened a criminal investigation into January’s mid-flight blowout of a Boeing 737 MAX operated by Alaska Airlines.
A preliminary report by the US National Transportation Safety Board into the incident found evidence suggesting that four key bolts designed to hold the door in place had been missing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said last week it had given Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to correct problems in its production and shortage procedures following an audit that identified “non-compliance issues”.
A separate FAA report released last month found serious problems with Boeing’s safety culture, including fears of retaliation among employees with safety concerns.

The Charleston County Coroner’s Office reported that “his death appears to result from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.”
In two full days of depositions, Barnett was questioned by Boeing lawyers on Thursday and by his own lawyers, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, on Friday.
Barnett, a former Snohomish County resident living in Louisiana, was scheduled to continue the deposition with his lawyers Saturday. When he didn’t show up, Turkewitz and Knowles called his hotel to ask for a welfare check. Barnett was found dead in his truck parked at the hotel.
In a statement, Turkewitz and Knowles called Barnett “a brave, honest man of the highest integrity.”
“He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft,” the lawyers wrote. “We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character.”
The statement went on to say that Barnett “was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on.”
“We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it. We are all devastated,” Turkewitz and Knowles wrote. “The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out.”
Barnett’s niece Katelyn Gillespie said Tuesday he was the fun uncle of the family.
She was very close to him. In Louisiana, where he came from, Barnett was into dirt-track car racing. He got Gillespie into race driving with him and tinkering with cars every weekend.
Gillespie said he was “stressed and depressed” by the latest flood of quality problems at Boeing and by the strain of his case against the company for harassing him and forcing him from his job.
She said Barnett was “the most selfless person” in private life and in his legal campaign against Boeing. He was pursuing the company not for money but to help save lives, she said.
“He battled a lot due to the Boeing stuff,” Gillespie said. “It took a major toll on him.”
In a statement, the Charleston Police Department declined media interviews, saying the case has gained “global attention” and that it will “ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence.”
Boeing in a statement said, “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”
A long struggle with Boeing
John Mitchell Barnett worked for Boeing for 32 years, starting as an electrician on the 747 jumbo jet program in Everett and working his way up to quality inspector, then manager of a quality organization. In Everett, he had top-class performance reviews.
In late 2010, he transferred to Boeing’s 787 plant in North Charleston, and there, in early 2012, he got the first performance downgrade of his career.
He reported later how a team of managers sent to South Carolina from Boeing’s unit in Missouri began to harass him for insisting on sticking to quality procedures and refusing to sign off on defective work.
Barnett informed managers about the quality shortfalls and the pressure applied to him, and he submitted an internal ethics complaint, all without success.
In January 2017, he filed a whistleblower complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
After six years of deteriorating relations with management and active harassment, he said the stress had badly affected his health, and he described himself as “broken” by Boeing. He took early retirement in March 2017.
Barnett began talking with The Seattle Times in April 2018, outlining a series of safety concerns on the 787 Dreamliner.
He described a broad failure to keep track of parts on airplanes at Boeing’s facilities in South Carolina. He spoke of thousands of defective parts that were lost in the system so that no one knew where they were.
He also reported finding a large batch of defective oxygen bottles that if installed on 787s would not have provided a flow of oxygen in case of cabin depressurization.
And he flagged a concern that certain titanium nuts being used to fasten the cabin flooring were shedding metal shavings into the electrical bays below, with the potential danger of triggering an electrical fire.
The Seattle Times chose to focus its investigation on the two specific safety issues, the defective oxygen bottles and the titanium shavings. Both were substantiated at least in part by the FAA.
A Freedom of Information Act request, which took the FAA nearly two-and-a-half years to fulfill, revealed that on the oxygen bottle issue, the FAA investigated and substantiated two out of four allegations.
The FAA found that Boeing had failed to keep records of and had not tracked the defective parts. It found that at least 53 “nonconforming parts are considered lost.”
Boeing insisted that it was just a crate of defective oxygen bottles that hadn’t been properly marked and that there were no defective bottles in service. The FAA backed Boeing’s assertion that there was no issue on any 787s in service.
Another Freedom of Information Act request on the titanium shavings issue was still not fully closed out three years later. In 2017, the FAA ordered inspections for the shavings on every 787 produced in both North Charleston and Everett.
In 2018, the FAA was still investigating the extent of the safety issue, and Boeing’s proposed corrective action was redacted from the documents received by The Seattle Times.
In all conversations with the Times, Barnett came across as a sincere person, with a genuine concern for the safety issues he had raised.
In late 2018, Barnett wrote an email to the Times summing up what he believed had been achieved by his external complaints and the press inquiries.
“I know the FAA are pushing inside Boeing to assure no future planes are delivered with this (oxygen bottle) condition, so on that front, they are doing what needs to be done,” he wrote. “I received a note on Facebook the other day from a Boeing employee in Everett saying they are still working (the titanium shavings) issue, so that’s good for future deliveries.”
“As far as those jets already delivered, they evaluated it and took appropriate action. I can’t ask for anything more on that front,” Barnett concluded. “I just hope it was an honest and thorough evaluation, but, that’s not mine to question.”
Yet Barnett said he now saw it as a major issue “that Boeing treats their Quality Managers and other Quality personnel in this manner.”
“The fact that they punished me for following procedures, for documenting process violations, for insisting the airplanes are built right seems to be more concerning,” than any one specific issue, he said.
In 2019, a month after the second crash of a 737 MAX, The New York Times published a story on the quality problems with the 787 in South Carolina, highlighting Barnett’s concerns.
Later that year, for Barnett’s exposure of potential safety problems on the Boeing 787, Ralph Nader awarded him the Joe A. Callaway Award for Civic Courage, which “recognizes individuals who take a public stance to advance truth and justice, at some personal risk.”
With that publicizing of his story, Barnett recently was interviewed by various media outlets as Boeing’s quality problems again became national news.
Meanwhile, his case claiming Boeing mistreated him for blowing the whistle on safety issues had slowly progressed. OSHA in 2021 found against him. He appealed that to the Department of Labor’s Office of Administrative Law Judges.
With a trial date scheduled for June, Barnett had traveled to Charleston last week from his home in Louisiana to give depositions for that appeal. His family, as representatives of his estate, may have the option to continue it.
Barnett’s wife died in 2022. He is survived by his mother, three brothers, two stepsons from a previous marriage and many nieces, nephews and grandnieces and grandnephews.",https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-787-whistleblower-found-dead-in-apparent-suicide/

Boeing has tapered its production of 737 planes while it gets its stuff together, leaving airlines with fewer aircraft.
• less than 3 min read
Even with a slew of safety incidents that make Snakes on a Plane look tolerable and a host of airlines cutting capacity due to a lack of planes, the worst of Boeing’s problems may still be ahead of it.
Within the last week, several Boeing planes caused panic around the world. A technical issue on a LATAM flight flung passengers around the cabin, injuring 50. Another plane had to make an emergency landing when flames burst out of an engine mid-flight.
And that’s just what happened in the air:
- The New York Times reported that an FAA audit—opened after a door plug flew off a Boeing 737 Max 9 during an Alaskan Airlines flight on January 5—found Boeing failed to comply with quality-control requirements. (The airline engineers and mechanics were aware of potential problems with the aircraft the day before the incident, according to the NYT.)
- The DOJ launched a criminal investigation into Boeing’s compliance with a settlement related to its role in two fatal 737 Max plane crashes in 2018 and 2019.
- A whistleblower who raised concerns about the company’s production line in 2019 was found dead on Saturday.
Airlines are getting cooked
More travelers might have to go the way of the Kenosha Kickers polka band. Boeing has tapered its production of 737 planes while it gets its stuff together, leaving airlines—which rely on Boeing as one of two main plane suppliers—with fewer aircraft.
Southwest got the worst of it: The airline notorious for not being bookable on Google Flights exclusively flies Boeing 737 planes. Southwest said it planned to receive 58 of Boeing’s 737 Max 8 planes but now expects just 46, and won’t get any of the long-awaited Max 7 jets. As a result, it cut flight capacity plans and changed its financial outlook for the year.
Other shake-ups in the industry include…United Airlines putting a pause on hiring pilots, Alaska Airlines saying its capacity for the year is in flux, and Ryanair lowering its passenger forecast—all because Boeing can’t deliver planes. It’s good news for Airbus, Boeing’s biggest rival, which delivered 49 planes in February compared to Boeing’s 27.

The AD states: “This proposed AD was prompted by a report of a non-conforming installation of spoiler wire bundles that led to unintended spoiler motion, including one instance of spoiler hardcover.”
The FAA received reports of “multiple unusual spoiler deployments, which resulted in an uncommanded roll to the right” during the flight cruise. The FAA investigation notes, “The related “SPOILERS” fault light on the P5–3 panel came on, and the spoiler control electronics (SCE) issued spoiler 10 fault code 27–01630. This event was noted as intermittent and was seen on multiple flights. A subsequent investigation found the root cause of the event was wire chafing damage due to spoiler control wire bundles riding on the landing gear beam rib in the right wing trailing edge due to non-conforming installation of spoiler wire bundles that occurred during production. This condition, if not addressed, could result in loss of control of the airplane. ”
Is this yet another hint of a production “quality escape?” It is a disturbing pattern. Can reintegrating Spirit AeroSystems help solve these issues and turn the pattern around? JP Morgan notes: “This won’t be a great financial transaction for Boeing near term and it’s not what mgmt intended coming into the year, in our view. But ultimately, it makes sense for Boeing to re-integrate Spirit and control the production of its key structures.”
Regarding the link above, Boeing responded to that article by saying: “These directives are unrelated, affecting different airplane models with different designs. The 787 NPRM is intended to address an isolated issue observed in fleet operations while the 737 MAX NPRM is intended to address a remote concern that has never occurred in service. Neither is an immediate safety-of-flight concern based on extensive engineering analysis. In both cases, the FAA NPRM proposes fleet actions that Boeing previously recommended to operators.
As this shows, our extensive efforts to further improve airplane safety include systematically reviewing issues in the in-service fleet and also using modeling analysis to identify potential issues that have never occurred. Then we work within Boeing and transparently with customers and suppliers, under the oversight of our regulator, to address any concerns.”
The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop on other products of the same type of design—the agency estimates repair costs at close to $18,000.
The number of issues on the MAX has now attracted the kind of attention reserved for Spirit Airlines. Wells Fargo notes on the possible reintegration of Spirit AeroSystems: “In our view, this move could mean BA has decided it can no longer tolerate missteps at SPR, given the increased regulatory scrutiny it now faces. It also allows BA to deflect blame, and to show it is taking action to improve quality, potentially appeasing regulators.”
Indeed, something has to be done. How much longer can this go on?

The retired Boeing Co. quality manager was found dead on a blustery, gray morning punctuated by roiling thunderstorms, crackling lightning and several inches of rain that flooded large swaths of the city. He was sitting in his pickup truck parked outside the Holiday Inn on Savannah Highway in West Ashley, Charleston police said. The Charleston County Coroner's Office said Barnett died from ""what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""
His death has grabbed international headlines. The 32-year Boeing veteran previously raised safety concerns about the aerospace giant, including at its 787 plant in North Charleston. His death has once again thrust the embattled company into the spotlight; his friends and family, meanwhile, are mourning a family-focused man with California and Louisiana roots.
Who was John Barnett?
Barnett was born in Mount Shasta, Calif., his brother Rodney said. It's a tiny town on the flanks of a snow-capped volcano.
A police report places Barnett’s home address in Pineville, La., a town some 125 miles northwest of Baton Rouge. Located across from the Red River, Pineville boasts a population of 14,109.
It’s some 860 miles from North Charleston, where Barnett worked toward the end of his career as a quality manager at the 787 Dreamliner plant.
He forged connections in the Charleston area, online tributes indicate. “I met Mitch only once on March 2nd in Charleston,” one read. “He made a Hell of an impression!”
A poster who called Barnett a “top notch” quality assurance inspector recalled conversations with his colleague about racing. Another poster said she will miss their back-porch chats. Still another promised to carry on Barnett's “racing legacy.”
A photo above Barnett’s obituary depicts him posing beside a lime-green race car, helmet tucked under one arm. Fellow race car drivers knew him as “Swamp Dawg.” Friends and family called him Mitch.
His sister-in-law, Ann Barnett, described him as an animal lover who was devoted to his late dog, Jack. He leaves behind another pet, Mama Cat, and her four kittens.
Family weighs in
Other family members have addressed the fraught relationship between Barnett and Boeing that preceded his death.
A turning point for Barnett was 2010, according to a statement his brother Rodney shared with The Post and Courier. It was the year he was transferred to the North Charleston plant. It was also when Barnett’s opinion of Boeing began to curdle.
Among Barnett’s observations: Upper management pressured quality inspectors and managers to cut corners. Workers were discouraged from documenting defects, lest they slow down the assembly line. Those who raised alarms were labeled “trouble makers, retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment.”
“John told us that every day was a battle to get management to do the right thing,” the statement read. “It caused John so much stress that his doctor told him that if he stayed, he would have a heart attack.”
Barnett retired in March 2017, two months after he filed a whistleblower complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. His case was up for trial in June.
Terry Barnett-Lewis, a cousin, told The Post and Courier his death was a “shock.”
“They’re good people,” Barnett-Lewis said of the Barnett brothers, with whom she doesn’t keep in close touch.
Barnett leaves behind three brothers, eight nieces and nephews, 11 great-nieces and nephews, and his mother, Vicky Melder Stokes.
“Those boys meant everything to her,” Barnett-Lewis said.",https://www.postandcourier.com/news/john-barnett-boeing-whistleblower-found-dead/article_4e8da500-e0a8-11ee-9414-efc4884bda79.html

The 62-year-old was found dead from a “self-inflicted gunshot wound” on March 9 in Charleston, South Carolina, according to the Charleston County coroner.
The coroner confirmed the death to the BBC on Monday.
In a statement, Boeing said, “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”
Barnett had worked for Boeing for 32 years before retiring in 2017.
According to the BBC, on several occasions, Barnett had reported about the company using sub-standard parts, and oxygen systems with serious problems. Barnett reportedly alerted managers who took no action to fix the issues and Boeing denied Barnett’s claims.
WIS-TV reported that Barnett’s attorneys, Robert Turkewitz of the Law Office of Robert M. Turkewitz, LLC and Brian Knowles of Knowles Law Firm, PC, released the following statement Tuesday afternoon:
“John was a brave, honest man of the highest integrity. He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft. We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character. In the course of his job as a quality manager at Boeing South Carolina, John learned of and exposed very serious safety problems with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and was retaliated against and subjected to a hostile work environment, which is the subject of his pending AIR-21 case. John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end. He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it. We are all devasted. We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.”
Police are reportedly investigating Barnett’s death.

Airline watchdogs were on Tuesday investigating why a Boeing-made LATAM plane bound for New Zealand suddenly lost altitude mid-flight, dropping violently and injuring dozens of terrified travellers.
Passengers said the Boeing 787 Dreamliner plunged earthward while en route from Sydney to Auckland on Monday evening, slinging unrestrained travellers out of their seats and smashing some into the roof of the cabin.
Chile-based LATAM Airlines said Tuesday it was working with authorities to pinpoint the unspecified ""technical event"" that caused flight LA800 to experience ""a strong movement"".
It is the latest in a string of safety incidents to plague US airplane manufacturer Boeing.
""It was just a split second,"" said Auckland-based chef Lucas Ellwood, who was one of 263 passengers and nine cabin crew aboard.
""The crashing of people into the roof caused the tiling to be dislodged,"" he told AFP on Tuesday.
""The guy behind me was in the toilet when it happened, the poor guy. He told me he went through the roof,"" he added.
On the ground, emergency crews were notified shortly before the flight landed and a phalanx of more than a dozen ambulances and other medical vehicles rushed to the scene.
Paramedics said they treated about 50 patients. Four people remained in hospital as of Tuesday morning, Health officials told AFP.
LATAM said in a statement that ""only one passenger and one crew member have injuries that require additional care but are not life-threatening.""
The flight arrived on time, the airline added.
'Black swan event'
The Chilean General Directorate of Civil Aeronautics said New Zealand air safety investigators will lead the probe into the incident, with Chilean help.
Air accident safety investigator Joe Hattley told AFP that technical problems were rare in modern aircraft.
""That flight record will be key to understanding this event. It will tell investigators if it was an atmospheric event or a technical problem with the aircraft,"" said Hattley, who also teaches at the University of New South Wales in Australia.
""These kinds of events highlight the absolute need for passengers to keep their seatbelts fastened.""
Brian Jokat, who was on board, said he saw a passenger strike the roof of the plane before falling back down and hitting his ribs on an armrest.
""He was on the roof of the plane on his back, looking down on me. It was like 'The Exorcist',"" Jokat told national broadcaster Radio New Zealand.
Jokat said that after the plane landed, the pilot came to the back of the cabin.
""I asked him 'what happened?' and he said to me 'I lost my instrumentation briefly and then it just came back all of a sudden',"" Jokat said.
Ashok Poduval, a commercial airline pilot for 15 years and now chief executive of the Massey University School of Aviation, said the incident appeared to be an ultra-rare ""black swan event"".
""A malfunction of the autopilot or unexpected clear-air turbulence are some of the possibilities that could cause an upset of this nature,"" he said, adding that only the investigation could tell for sure.
""They will be examining the digital flight data recorders, the cockpit voice recorders, they will be interviewing the pilots before they come to any conclusion.""
Data from airline tracker FlightAware showed the plane began losing altitude about two hours into the three-hour flight. But it was unclear if this was part of its descent into Auckland.
Safety issues
US manufacturer Boeing has suffered a series of safety issues in recent years, including the fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes of 737 MAX planes in 2018 and 2019 that killed more than 350 people.
""We are working to gather more information about the flight and will provide any support needed by our customer,"" Boeing said in a statement sent to AFP.
""Boeing stands ready to support investigation-related activities as requested,"" the company added later.
The manufacturer is still reeling from a near-catastrophic incident in January when a fuselage panel on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 Alaska Airlines jet blew off mid-flight in the United States.
Last week, a Boeing 777 jetliner bound for Japan had to make an emergency landing shortly after takeoff from San Francisco when a wheel fell off and plunged into an airport parking lot, damaging several cars.
US regulators earlier this month gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan addressing quality control issues, with the Federal Aviation Administration chief saying the company must ""commit to real and profound improvements"".
Since the start of the year, Boeing's share price has dropped 25 percent.
""Boeing has some controlled issues in production, but generally most aircraft are good and reliable,"" said Upstream Aviation consultant Tim Collins.
He said Boeing made up about 50 percent of the global jet fleet.
""While some people might think twice about Boeing's reputation, the same would happen if an Airbus crashed tomorrow.""

At least 50 people were injured Monday after a LATAM Airlines Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner ""dipped so dramatically into a nose dive for a couple of seconds"" during a flight to New Zealand, causing passengers to slam into the roof of the cabin, witnesses say.
LATAM Airlines says the plane traveling from Sydney, Australia, experienced ""a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement."" Paramedics and more than 10 emergency vehicles were waiting for passengers when flight LA800 landed in Auckland.
""The plane dipped so dramatically into a nose dive for a couple of seconds and around 30 people hit the ceiling hard,"" said Daniel, one passenger onboard the aircraft, according to the New Zealand Herald.
""None of us knew what had happened until after the flight, I was just trying to keep everyone calm,"" he added. ""We never heard any announcement from the captain.""

""I had just dozed off and I luckily had my seatbelt on, and all of a sudden the plane just dropped,"" passenger Brian Jokat also told broadcaster RNZ. ""It wasn’t one of those things where you hit turbulence and you drop a few times ... we just dropped.""
Jokat said one passenger two seats away from him wasn’t wearing his seatbelt when the drop happened.
""I thought I was dreaming. I opened my eyes and he was on the roof of the plane on his back, looking down on me. It was like The Exorcist,"" he said.
Jokat also told RNZ that the incident occurred in seconds.
""I felt the plane take a nosedive – it felt like it was at the top of a rollercoaster, and then it flattened out again,"" he reportedly added, noting that people onboard and the flight crew tended to the injured until the plane landed.
FAMILY OF INDIANA MOM WHO DIED ON AA PLANE REMAIN WITH UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
About 50 people were treated at the scene for mostly mild injuries while 13 of them were transported to a hospital, an ambulance spokesperson told the Associated Press. One patient who was on the flight was reportedly in serious condition.
The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner's final destination was Santiago, Chile, but was landing at Auckland Airport in accordance with its normal flight path, according to Reuters. The flight to Santiago on Monday has been canceled and rescheduled for Tuesday, with the airline providing food and accommodation to travelers affected, according to RNZ.
""LATAM regrets the inconvenience and injury this situation may have caused its passengers, and reiterates its commitment to safety as a priority within the framework of its operational standards,"" the airline said.
Jokat told RNZ the pilot of the plane came to the back of the cabin after landing in Auckland.
""I asked him ‘what happened?’ and he said to me, ‘I lost my instrumentation briefly and then it just came back all of a sudden,’"" Jokat said.
The incident is the latest mishap involving a Boeing plane.
In January, a door plug blew off Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 – a Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft – causing the cabin to depressurize and forcing it to make an emergency landing in Portland, Oregon. The Justice Department reportedly is opening an investigation into that incident.
Last week, a United Airlines Boeing 777-200 departing San Francisco lost a wheel during takeoff. The tire fell and proceeded to damage a few parked cars at the airport.

The next day, a Boeing 737 skidded off the runway after landing in Houston, Texas, the Federal Aviation Administration said.

March 11, 2024, © Leeham News: In the public arena, Boeing is flailing. It’s the subject of public rebukes by government officials, a new criminal investigation by the US Department of Justice, and a seemingly endless stream of scathing headlines.
However, executives at its European counterpart, Airbus, are not celebrating Boeing’s struggles.
“Airbus needs Boeing,” said Joe Marcheschi, director of flying parts procurement services for Airbus Americas. “Disruption, and turmoil in the supply chain hurts Airbus, too.”
The industry’s supply chain depends in large part on the two aerospace giants—which means, indirectly, Boeing and Airbus need each other.
Instability at the airplane makers may in some sense have furthered this interdependence by prompting many suppliers dependent on one OEM to diversify by supplying both companies and by looking outside commercial aerospace.

Before his death over the weekend, John Barnett had spent years speaking out against Boeing and alleged safety issues after retiring in 2017.

John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager, was found dead over the weekend from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound days after testifying about safety issues with the company’s aircraft production.
The 62-year-old had spent years speaking out against what he alleged were shoddy manufacturing practices at Boeing, where he worked for 30 years before he retired in 2017. Most recently, Barnett was in Charleston for legal interviews related to a lawsuit against the Arlington, Virginia-based company.
Here's what to know about Barnett and the safety concerns he's raised about Boeing.
Who was John Barnett?
Barnett spent decades working for Boeing, first at its plants in Everett, Washington, and, beginning in 2010, as a quality manager in North Charleston, South Carolina, NPR reported.
He first made international headlines in April 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees came forward to The New York Times to accuse the company of overlooking manufacturing issues in favor of making profits, putting passenger safety at risk.
The aircraft in question is a two-aisle plane that airlines widely use for international flights.
""As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,"" Barnett told the news outlet at the time. ""And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy.""
What do we know about his death?
Authorities searched for Barnett at his hotel in South Carolina after he failed to show up Saturday for an ongoing deposition against the company.
Barnett, a Louisiana resident, was then found dead in a car outside a Holiday Inn from what the Charleston County Coroner’s Office ruled was suicide. The Charleston City Police Department is investigating.
Barnett’s brother, Rodney Barnett, said in a family statement to the Associated Press on Tuesday that the years of speaking out against Boeing created stress for him and led to a decline in his mental health.
“He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death,” the brother said.
In a statement to USA TODAY, Boeing said it was “saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.""
What problems with Boeing's Dreamliner production have been uncovered?
Barnett became one of several whistleblowers who helped expose allegations of quality issues at Boeing in a 2019 New York Times investigation.
Barnett said he found discarded sharp metal shavings near electrical systems for the flight controls at Boeing’s factory in South Carolina, where the 787 jetliner is assembled that he said could have been “catastrophic” if the pieces pierced the wiring. After he raised the complaint to his superiors, Barnett claimed he was moved to another part of the plant.
A Boeing spokesman told the New York Times that safety issues are “immediately investigated and changes are made whenever necessary.”
Later that same year, Barnett told the BBC that he became aware of faulty installation of the aircraft's oxygen systems, which could deprive some breathing masks of oxygen in the event of an emergency. Boeing denied the claim.
Barnett filed a pending whistleblower complaint with the government, which had a hearing scheduled for June, the Associated Press reported.
“John was deeply concerned about the safety of the aircraft and flying public, and had identified some serious defects that he felt were not adequately addressed,” according to his brother Rodney's statement to the Associated Press. “He said that Boeing had a culture of concealment and was putting profits over safety.”
Boeing recently came under additional scrutiny this week after a six-week Federal Aviation Administration audit of Boeing and subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems found the company routinely failed to comply with quality control mandates.
The update came after a Boeing 737 Max 9 lost a door plug mid-flight during an Alaska Airlines flight in January. After the incident, the FAA grounded all Boeing 737 Max 9 planes with a door plug to conduct an investigation and inspect all the relevant aircrafts.
Late last month, Boeing was given 90 days to present a plan to “fix systemic quality-control issues.""

According to CNBC, Airbus has delivered 79 planes in January and February of 2024, compared to 54 for Boeing.
Multiple troubles, including federal investigations, have brought delays to Boeing’s manufacturing that are beginning to bite with customers. On March 12, Southwest, which exclusively uses Boeing’s 737s, announced its intention to scale back its capacity and rethink its financial outlook for 2024, as it now assumes there will be no 737-7 aircraft deliveries this year[1] . United Airlines also removed the yet-to-be-certified 737 MAX 10 from plans for its own fleet.

This all goes back to a January 5 incident when a door plug on a Boeing 737 MAX blew out right after takeoff out of Portland, forcing an emergency landing, and ultimately leading to months of increased scrutiny and criticism from federal leaders and lawmakers.
Boeing’s woes have only escalated since the door-plug incident, amid a criminal investigation from the Department of Justice, ongoing production delays, and cratering stock prices.

It’s unclear what exactly caused the incident, with the airline describing it as a “technical event.”
Then on March 12, it was revealed that Boeing whistleblower John Barnett was found dead from a “self-inflicted” wound in his truck at a hotel car park in Charleston, South Carolina. The 62-year-old worked for the company for more than three decades, before coming forward in 2019, claiming that rushed processes on the assembly line at Boeing’s North Carolina plant had compromised the safety of the 787 Dreamliner.
Barnett was reportedly in South Carolina for legal interviews related to an ongoing lawsuit against Boeing.

The protest happened at the Boeing Co facility at 801 Irving Wick Drive West in Heath.
Heath Police Chief David Harren said protesters were stationed at all of the entrances at the facility so that employees couldn't enter or leave.
Two bridges in the area were blocked off. Harren said a man and a woman attached themselves to one of the bridges.
A disabled vehicle blocked the road. Harren said another man and woman were cemented to the outside of the car.
Heath police called the Newark Division of Fire to assist with the incident. Fire officials worked to free the people hanging from the bridge and those cemented to the vehicle.
Harren said the four protesters were taken into custody and are facing charges, including a felony obstruction charge. One other person was later arrested. No injuries were reported.
In a statement, Boeing said it is working with local law enforcement as the investigation continues.

Learn about our editorial policies Published March 11, 2024 GIUSEPPE CACACE / Contributor / Getty Images Close Key Takeaways Boeing's stock lost ground in early trading Monday following reports of injuries from a ""technical problem"" on a LATAM flight involving a Boeing aircraft and a Justice Department probe into an Alaska Airlines flight in January where a door plug came loose.The DOJ's investigation comes as Boeing is also subject to other active investigations.Boeing shares have lost over one-fifth of their value since the start of 2024 amid concerns about ongoing investigations and other issues. Boeing (BA) shares fell more than 3% in early afternoon trading Monday following reports of injuries from a ""technical problem"" on a LATAM flight involving a Boeing aircraft and a Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into an Jan. 5 Alaska Airlines (ALK) flight where a door panel came loose from a plane. The Justice Department has begun interviewing pilots and flight attendants who were on the plane and taken steps to contact passengers, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal. Through its investigation, the DOJ could reportedly determine whether Boeing may have violated a previous settlement related to a pair of 737 MAX crashes in 2018 and 2019. If the aircraft maker is found to have violated the settlement, it could be charged with defrauding the U.S., or the DOJ could seek to extend the three-year probationary period during which Boeing has to update the federal government on its compliance improvements. The reported investigation joins other active investigations related to the company's manufacturing and safety processes. Just last week, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it was investigating a February incident in which a pilot in a Boeing 737 Max 8 reported stuck rudder pedals during a landing. Separately, a LATAM Airlines flight arriving in Auckland, New Zealand, Monday reportedly experienced a ""technical event"" that caused a ""strong movement."" The Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner landed safely, but an estimated 50 passengers and crew were treated for injuries by first responders at the airport. “We are working to gather more information about the flight and will provide any support needed by our customer,"" a Boeing spokesperson told Investopedia. Boeing declined to comment on the DOJ's reported investigation, and the DOJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment early Monday morning. “In an event like this, it’s normal for the DOJ to be conducting an investigation. We are fully cooperating and do not believe we are a target of the investigation,” an Alaska Airlines spokesperson told Investopedia. Boeing shares were 3% lower at $192.61 as of 12:42 p.m. Monday. They've lost more than 23% of their value since the start of 2024 amid concerns about ongoing investigations and other issues.

John Barnett, 62, worked for Boeing for three decades and retired in 2017
The whistleblower who publicly raised doubts about Boeing's production standards was found dead.
The Charleston County Coroner's Office told Fox News Digital that John Barnett, 62, died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Saturday. Barnett was cross-examined by Boeing's lawyers and his own attorney days before he died.
The court planned for Barnett to answer more questions on Saturday, but he did not appear as planned.
The BBC reported that he was later found dead in his truck, which was parked in a hotel parking garage.
FAA GIVES BOEING 90 DAYS TO DEVELOP PLAN TO ADDRESS 'QUALITY-CONTROL' ISSUES
Barnett was employed by Boeing for over three decades before retiring in 2017. He worked as a quality control engineer at the company.
In 2019, Barnett told the BBC that Boeing would rush to get its 787 Dreamliner jets off the production line, compromising safety.
He alleged the emergency oxygen systems that were made for 787 Dreamliners had a failure rate of 25%. This meant that a quarter of 787 Dreamliners had the potential to rapidly lose oxygen if the cabins were suddenly decompressed, suffocating passengers.
Barnett said that he had encountered these issues when he began working at Boeing's North Charleston plant in 2010. He reportedly raised his concerns to his managers, but did not see them take any action.
BOEING TO STABILIZE 737 PRODUCTION LATER THIS YEAR, EXEC SAYS
The Federal Aviation Administration reviewed Boeing in 2017 and ordered the company to take action, which corroborated some of Barnett's allegations.
This past January, Barnett told TMZ he was concerned that Boeing was returning its 737 Max 9 jets to the sky too quickly, after the incident in which an Alaska Airlines jet's door panel blew off midflight.
Boeing told FOX Business that the company was saddened by Barnett's death.
""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,"" Boeing's statement read.

One passenger, Brian Jokat, told the BBC that the plane “dropped unlike anything” he had ever experienced before, causing some passengers to hit the roof and break the roof panels. After it landed, New Zealand’s Hato Hone St. John ambulance service treated about 50 people, said Anna Pownall, its area operations manager, in a statement. A total of 12 people were transported to the hospital, including one in serious condition and the remainder with moderate to minor injuries, according to Pownall.
Latam Airlines, which operated the plane, told multiple outlets that the incident involved “a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement.”
Latam said in a press release that the plane “experienced a strong shake whose causes are being investigated,” and when reached for comment a spokesperson for the airline directed Fortune to its publicly available statement. A spokesperson for Boeing told Fortune in a statement that the company was “working to gather more information about the flight.”
The Latam flight injuries are just the latest of a string of incidents involving Boeing-made planes since the start of the year. In the past week alone, a Boeing plane has veered off the runway, lost a tire, and shot flames from its engine—all in separate incidents.
Although the plane that lost a tire was not built recently and the flaming engine was reportedly caused by bubble wrap that was sucked into it, the proximity of the incidents to each other is a bad look for a company already under scrutiny.
Boeing’s most recent troubles began in January when a door plug on a 737-MAX 9 operated by Alaska Airlines blew off while the plane was in midair, requiring it to turn back only 20 minutes after departure.
Following the event, a preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the door plug that blew off may have been missing bolts. The Federal Aviation Administration audited Boeing and a supplier, Spirit AeroSystems, after the door plug incident and found several noncompliance issues, according to a statement by the agency. The FAA gave Boeing 90 days to outline a plan to address the audit’s findings as well as previous concerns over its “safety culture.”
The Justice Department has now opened a criminal probe into the door plug incident in January and a grand jury has been convened to examine the evidence, the Washington Post reported, citing a person briefed on the matter. The probe may not necessarily result in charges.
Boeing’s stock has plummeted 23% since the start of the year thanks in part to the recent issues. The company’s shares were down 3% as of market close on Monday.",https://fortune.com/2024/03/11/boeing-plane-incidents-auckland-technical-event-fifty-injured/

Police in Charleston, S.C., are investigating the death of John Barnett, a former Boeing quality control manager who became a whistleblower when he went public with his concerns about serious safety issues in the company's commercial airplanes.
Barnett's body was found in a vehicle in a Holiday Inn parking lot in Charleston on Saturday, police said. One day earlier, he testified in a deposition related to the string of problems he says he identified at Boeing's plant where he once helped inspect the 787 Dreamliner aircraft before delivery to customers.
Barnett was in the middle of giving deposition testimony in his whistleblower retaliation case against Boeing when he died, his lawyers, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, told NPR.
""He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on,"" the South Carolina-based attorneys said in a joint statement. ""We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.""
Police said officers were sent to the hotel to conduct a welfare check after people were unable to contact Barnett, who had traveled to Charleston to testify in his lawsuit against Boeing.
""Upon their arrival, officers discovered a male inside a vehicle suffering from a gunshot wound to the head,"" police said in a statement sent to NPR. ""He was pronounced deceased at the scene.""
The office of Charleston County Coroner Bobbi Jo O'Neal said that Barnett, who had been living in his home state of Louisiana after retiring from Boeing, died ""from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""
Charleston police said detectives are actively investigating the case and are awaiting a formal cause of death as they try to determine the circumstances surrounding Barnett's death.
Barnett, who spent decades working for Boeing at its plants in Everett, Wash., and North Charleston, S.C., had repeatedly alleged that Boeing's manufacturing practices had declined — and that rather than improve them, he added, managers had pressured workers not to document potential defects and problems.
""We are saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,"" Boeing said in a statement sent to NPR.
Barnett, 62, made international headlines in April of 2019 when he and other former Boeing employees spoke to The New York Times about what he called shoddy manufacturing problems at Boeing. Barnett accused the company of adopting a culture that prioritized raw numbers and profits over quality — and by extension, passenger safety.
""As a quality manager at Boeing, you're the last line of defense before a defect makes it out to the flying public,"" Barnett told the newspaper. ""And I haven't seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I'd put my name on saying it's safe and airworthy.""
By the time the article appeared, Barnett had already filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing, saying that his attempts to raise quality and safety problems had been ignored and that he was punished for continuing to flag them.
Barnett filed a whistleblower complaint against Boeing in early 2017; his case against the company was heading toward a trial this June, his family said.
""He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture,"" the family said in a statement shared with NPR by his brother, Rodney Barnett.
The family says Barnett's health declined because of the stresses of taking a stand against his longtime employer.
""He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing,"" they said, ""which we believe led to his death.""
When John Barnett was interviewed by Ralph Nader in 2019, he said health issues had persisted after he retired from the plane-maker.
""It's taken a serious mental and emotional toll on me,"" Barnett said — but, he added, the safety of the airplanes rolling off the production line remained his main focus.
""That's what my story is about, is telling my story enough to where the right people get involved to make sure that these airplanes are made correctly,"" Barnett said. ""Because the 787 carries 288 passengers plus crew. So the last thing I want to do is wake up in the morning and see a 787 has gone down"" because of one of the problems he identified.
""I mean, it's just, it keeps me up at night,"" he said.

Officials in Charleston say Barnett died from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound on March 9. Police are continuing to investigate the incident.
Barnett, a 32-year veteran at Boeing, first made headlines in 2019 as one of the several whistleblowers who expressed concerns about issues at Boeing’s South Carolina plant, which makes the 787 Dreamliner aircraft. He told the New York Times he had found clusters of metal shavings left near flight control electrical systems, which could have resulted in “catastrophic” results if those shavings had penetrated the wiring.
He retired in 2017, two months after filing a whistleblower complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), citing health reasons and saying he had been subjected to retaliation. The BBC reports Barnett was in Charleston for legal interviews surrounding his legal action against the company, alleging Boeing had damaged his career because of the safety issues he cited.
Boeing has denied those charges and, in a statement following his death, said: “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.”
The Charleston Police Department in a statement to Fortune, said “Detectives are actively investigating this case and are awaiting the formal cause of death, along with any additional findings that might shed further light on the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Barnett… We understand the global attention this case has garnered, and it is our priority to ensure that the investigation is not influenced by speculation but is led by facts and evidence.”
Barnett’s death comes as Boeing is under increased scrutiny for its safety practices. In January, the emergency exit door blew off a new Boeing 737 Max jet while in flight. A National Transportation Safety Board preliminary report found that four bolts, designed to hold the door in place, were not fitted on that plane. And last week, an FAA audit found “multiple instances where the company allegedly failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements.”",https://fortune.com/2024/03/12/boeing-whistleblower-john-barnett-found-dead/

Boeing whistleblower John Barnett was found dead in a South Carolina parking lot just days after giving evidence against the company in a lawsuit against them, as the company faces increasing scrutiny over the safety of its aircraft.
Key Facts
Barnett, 62, was found dead in his truck in a hotel car park in South Carolina over the weekend, where he had been giving evidence against his former employer in a whistleblower lawsuit and had been expected to attend court for further questioning on Saturday.
The Charleston County coroner’s office in South Carolina said Barnett died from what appeared to be a “self-inflicted” wound on March 9, adding that local police are investigating.
Barnett was a Boeing veteran who worked at the company for 32 years until retiring in 2017, including seven years as a quality control manager at the South Carolina plant where it builds its 787 Dreamliner jet.
In 2019, Barnett was one of several whistleblowers to raise concerns over the company’s manufacturing process, claiming the rush to complete aircraft meant safety was compromised as workers were pressured to cut corners and install sub-standard parts for the planes.
Barnett, who also said he uncovered issues with aircraft oxygen systems and had found sharp metal shavings near flight control wiring, claimed he repeatedly raised his concerns with managers but that he was ignored and moved to another part of the factory.
After retiring, Barnett sued Boeing for allegedly retaliating against him for raising concerns—Boeing denies this and Barnett’s other claims, although some safety concerns were upheld by the Federal Aviation Authority in 2017—accusing the company of hampering his career progression and denigrating his character.
Key Background
Barnett had been in Charleston giving interviews for his whistleblower case against Boeing at the time of his death. He had already given a formal deposition to answer questions from Boeing’s lawyers and undergone cross-examination by his own legal team. He was due to undergo further questioning on Saturday but did not appear at court. In a statement, Boeing said it was “saddened” to hear of Barnett’s death and that its “thoughts are with his family and friends.”
News Peg
Barnett’s death comes as Boeing deals with increasing scrutiny over the safety of its aircraft and the quality control measures implemented when making them. At least 50 people were injured aboard a Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by Chilean carrier LATAM on Monday after a technical issue caused the flight to suddenly plunge mid-air, throwing people out of their seats and smashing some passengers into the cabin ceiling. A Japan-bound United Airlines jet, a Boeing 777, was forced to make an emergency landing last week after a tire fell off during takeoff, smashing a car in the employee parking lot. The company is also facing a criminal probe after the door to a Boeing 737 Max 9 jet blew open mid-flight aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 1282 in January. That probe is due to feed into a review over whether the company complied with a settlement in a federal investigation into the fatal crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 jets in 2018 and 2019, which killed nearly 350 people.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2024/03/12/boeing-whistleblower-john-barnett-found-dead-this-weekend-heres-what-to-know/

A Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner “nosedived” while traveling from Australia to New Zealand, the Associated Press reports, resulting in at least 50 injuries. According to local authorities, 13 passengers were taken to a hospital and one is in serious condition.
The flight’s operator, Chilean multinational airline LATAM Airlines, has since said that the plane nosedived due to a “technical event,” but didn’t elaborate further.
“The plane landed at Auckland Airport as scheduled,” the company said in a statement.
But getting there was a nightmare for passengers. One circulating video shows a chaotic scene, with passengers being treated while lying in the center aisle.
“The ceiling’s broken from people’s heads and bodies hitting it,” passenger Brian Jokat told ABC News. “Basically neck braces were being put on people, guys’ heads were cut and they were bleeding. It was just crazy.”
“I did think for a split second: ‘This is it’,” he told the BBC.
Hitting the Roof
It’s yet another incident involving Boeing’s airliners, adding to the company’s already considerable woes following several technical issues plaguing the aerospace giant.
Over the weekend, a Boeing 737 had to make an emergency landing after an engine ingested some bubble wrap. Last week, a Boeing 777-200 lost a tire after takeoff, destroying a car.
And in January, a Boeing 737 MAX 9 lost a “door plug,” triggering a “violent explosive decompression event.” The pilots were forced to return to the Portland, Oregon, airport.
Boeing has issued a statement in light of the latest incident, noting that officials were still trying to work out what happened.
“We are working to gather more information about the flight and will provide any support needed by our customer,” Boeing said.
LATAM Airlines has said that it “deeply regrets any inconvenience and discomfort this situation may have caused its passengers.”

At least 50 people were injured on board a Boeing 787-9 flight from Sydney to Auckland operated by Chilean airline LATAM, after the aircraft experienced a technical issue that caused it to suddenly lose altitude.
Key Facts
According to the New Zealand Herald, which first reported the story, a technical issue caused “strong movement” on board the flight and led to a sudden loss of altitude.
Some passengers and crew on board were “thrown into the roof” of the plane due to the sudden drop.
Citing emergency services, the BBC reported that 12 people—both passengers and crew—were taken to hospital after the plane landed, one of whom was in serious condition.
According to FlightAware, the affected LA800 flight was a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner and it landed successfully in Auckland at 4:26 p.m. local time.
The incident took place mid-flight, with approximately an hour left on the journey, reports say.
Crucial Quote
LATAM told news outlets that some passengers and cabin crew were “affected” by the incident and were treated by medical staff at the airport. “Latam regrets the inconvenience and injury this situation may have caused its passengers, and reiterates its commitment to safety as a priority within the framework of its operational standards,” the airline added.
What To Watch For
Neither LATAM nor Boeing have commented on the cause of the incident. The plane was scheduled to fly from Auckland to Santiago, Chile later on Monday evening. That flight has now been canceled and a new flight will depart for Santiago on Tuesday night, Radio New Zealand reported. It is unclear if the rescheduled itinerary will use a separate aircraft.

The Federal Aviation Administration found dozens of issues throughout Boeing’s 737 MAX jet production process, including mechanics at one of its key suppliers using a hotel key card and dish soap as makeshift tools to test compliance, according to a report.
The FAA discovered “unacceptable” quality control issues during an audit of Boeing and supplier Spirit AeroSystems that was launched after a door plug flew off a 737 MAX 9 at 16,000 feet on Jan. 5.
The agency did not release its findings to the public, but a presentation detailing the results reviewed by the New York Times reveals a troubling and inconsistent manufacturing process.
Boeing failed 33 out of 89 product audits — a review of specific aspects in the production line — with a total of 97 counts of alleged noncompliance, the auditors found, according to the newspaper.
Spirit AeroSystems, which makes the body of the 737 MAX jets, failed seven out of 13 product audits conducted by the FAA, the publication reported.
One of its failures dealt with the installation of the plane’s door plug.
Some of the most shocking details from the presentation happened at Spirit AeroSytems’ fuselage manufacturing plant in Wichita, Kansas.
FAA auditors spotted mechanics from the company using a hotel key card to check the seal on a door in one instance and witnessed other Spirit mechanics applying Dawn liquid soap to a door seal “as a lubricant in the fit-up process,” the Times reported.
In the latter incident, the mechanics used wet cheesecloth to wipe away the dish soap and clean the door seal.

The document detailing the audit findings obtained by the outlet said the instructions provided to mechanics were “vague and unclear on what specifications/actions are to be followed or recorded by the mechanic.”
A spokesperson for Spirit AeroSystems — which Boeing is in talks to reacquire — told the Times that the company is “reviewing all identified nonconformities for corrective action.”
Boeing did not immediately comment on the audit’s findings — which the FAA has refused to make public because of its ongoing investigation into the door plug incident on the Alaska Airlines flight and Boeing’s response to it.

Southwest Airlines said Tuesday it will cut its flight capacity after it received fewer Boeing jets than expected, sending its stock price spiraling as the turmoil over safety concerns at Boeing creates a ripple effect across the airline industry.
Key Facts
Southwest’s shares plummeted more than 14% on Tuesday, falling to a two-month low of just under $29.
That drop marks Southwest’s worst day since the Covid-19 pandemic shook the airline industry exactly four years to the day, sending its shares down more than 15% on March 12, 2020.
Southwest’s descent on Tuesday comes as the airline announced in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it will reduce flight capacity and “re-optimize schedules” later this year, and reevaluate its 2024 spending.
Those changes stem from a drop in deliveries from Boeing, which informed Southwest it will deliver 46 of its popular 737-8 jets this year, a reduction from the 58 models Southwest had expected and just over half of all 737 models the airline had anticipated from Boeing, one of just two major commercial aircraft manufacturers.
News Peg
Boeing’s stock also took a dip on Wall Street on Tuesday, falling nearly 5% to a five-month low of just under $184 per share. The stock has erased $45 billion of market value just this year.
Key Background
Boeing has faced heavy scrutiny over mounting safety concerns in recent years over its 737 models, after two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving its 737-MAX jet, and more recently after a door plug blew out of a Boeing jet in January during an Alaska Airlines flight, forcing it to make an emergency landing after a gaping hole was blown into the side of the plane. A report from a Federal Aviation Administration independent panel found a “disconnect” on the company’s “safety culture,” while National Transportation and Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy claimed last week that Boeing has not provided information for its investigation into the door plug incident, including documents and the names of employees who work on door plugs. Boeing faces several other ongoing investigations: the Department of Justice recently launched a criminal investigation into the door plug incident. while the NTSB also opened an investigation into the company’s 737 MAX 8 jet after a jet’s pedal rudder became stuck as pilots attempted to land a plane in Newark last month.
Tangent
Shares of Southwest, an airline long known for low fares and reduced operational costs, had been slowly resurging after Covid-era restrictions brought air travel to a standstill, though its shares took another tumble in late 2022 after the airline’s epic meltdown over the winter holidays. In a matter of days, a series of winter storms forced the airline to cancel more than 16,000 flights, stranding more than two million passengers, which was made worse by Southwest’s lack of a major hub, or a central airport where it could regroup its jets. Southwest offered those passengers rebooked flights at no extra cost for what COO Andrew Watterson admitted was an “epic screw up,” and the airline has faced legal hurdles as a result, including a class-action lawsuit from passengers and a federal investigation it settled for $140 million.

In the biggest change, workers at the Boeing Commercial Airplane division will see 60% of their annual incentive score based on safety and quality metrics. Previously, 75% of the score was based on financial metrics, whereas operational metrics accounted for just 25%, and included targets beyond safety and quality, Boeing said in an emailed statement.
The changes, which were communicated at an all-employee meeting on March 7, come two months after a near-disaster on a new Boeing 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines, when a door plug blew off shortly after takeoff. No one was injured and the plane landed safely.
“It’s very, very important to drive the outcomes that we’re all committed to, and that’s to deliver a safe and quality product to our customer,” Boeing’s chief operating officer Stephanie Pope told the employee meeting.
On March 6, U.S. crash investigators, in a highly unusual rebuke, accused Boeing officials of failing to cooperate in a probe of how the panel flew off. Investigators are also looking into another incident involving the 737 Max, in which the plane’s rudder system malfunctioned as pilots were landing.
Other Boeing business units will see minor changes to the bonus structure. At the Defense, Space and Security division and Boeing Global Services, operational metrics will continue to be 25% of the business unit scores, though will focus solely on safety and quality. The Enterprise, or corporate, plan will be an average of the three business units’ scores.
Details of the bonus metrics changes were reported earlier by the Wall Street Journal.

Close Key Takeaways Boeing shares fell more than 4% Tuesday after leading airlines raised concerns over delivery issues with the troubled airplane maker.The company delivered 17 narrow-body Max jets last month, eight less than it did in January and about half the amount it shipped in November and December.The Boeing share price may find chart support around $174 from an 18-month horizontal line. Shares in troubled airplane maker Boeing (BA) slipped more than 4% on Tuesday as a slowdown in production following a series of highly publicized safety incidents and manufacturing glitches continue to weigh on the company's stock. Recent announcements from leading airlines have put the spotlight on Boeing’s stalled plane deliveries. Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines (LUV) said on Tuesday that it plans to slash flight capacity and review its earnings guidance due to lower-than-expected deliveries from the plane manufacturer. Perhaps more troubling for Boeing shareholders, United Airlines (UAL) CEO Scott Kirby told analysts at the JP Morgan Industrials Conference on Tuesday that the carrier is considering ordering rival Airbus (EADSY) A321neos to replace previously ordered Boeing 737 Max 10s due to certification uncertainty related to production and quality issues. “As much as I would like those deliveries, this is not a 12-month issue,” Kirby said in relation to the airline’s Boeing orders. “This is a two-decade issue,” he added. The airline had ordered 151 Max 10s initially intended for delivery over the next two years, but has recently removed those jets from its fleet plan due to Boeing’s production challenges. Currently, United has six A321neos in service and 174 of the jets on order. Boeing has wound back production of its top selling 737 MAX planes in recent months amid heighted scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) after a series of safety incidents and production glitches, most notably a door plug blowing out of a MAX 737 operated by Alaska Airlines (ALK) mid-flight in January. The company said it delivered 17 narrow-body Max jets last month, eight less than it did in January and about half the amount it handed over to customers in November and December. Boeing shares continue to nosedive after breaking below a long-term uptrend line stretching back to late September 2022. Moreover, the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average last week to form an ominous death cross—a chart pattern that often marks the start of a new downtrend. It’s also worth noting that trading volume has increased in recent days as the share price has fallen, indicating active participation in the sell-off. Looking ahead, investors should keep an eye on a key 18-month horizontal line around $174 that may provide a near-term floor of support. Boeing shares fell 4.3% to close Tuesday's regular trading session at $184.24. The stock, which fell an additional 0.2% in after-hours trading, has lost more than a quarter of its value since the beginning of the year.

Safety concerns prompt flyers to change their flights.
Airplane manufacturing giant Boeing is going viral this week for all the wrong reasons.
The company's fleet of commercial airplanes has been rife with safety issues, prompting widespread media attention and mounting concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and flyers. Here's what you need to know.
What is going on with Boeing planes, and what does John Oliver have to do with it?
It's been a turbulent few weeks for Boeing planes, as several aircraft have experienced alarming issues mid-flight — we'll get into that later — but the company started getting a lot of heat for its insufficient safety protocols after John Oliver's Last Week Tonight did a brilliant and damning segment on it last week.
You May Also Like
We've embedded the entire video, which is worth a watch. But the TL;DR of the commentary from Oliver: Boeing's company culture shifted away from safety and quality to increasing shareholder value, which resulted in, well, plummeting safety and quality.
Oliver goes through the history of the company in depth, providing context for the recent safety issues. It's all fitting and in line with the reporting in 2018 and 2019 after two Boeing 737 Max crashes killed 346 people.
What's happening now with Boeing?
In short: a few things, none of them good. The New York Times reported that the FAA examined Boeing and found it failed 33 of 89 audits after a high-profile incident where a panel blew off a 737 Max 9 flight before reaching cruising altitude.
You've most likely seen footage of that terrifying incident where, by some miracle, everyone survived.
The Times goes into a bit of detail on these issues, but the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a quality-improvement plan.
The latest Boeing safety incidents
Fortunately, there haven't been fatal incidents in the past few weeks, but Boeing planes have experienced significant safety issues. Fifty people were injured on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner that took a nosedive flying from Sydney, Australia to Auckland, New Zealand on Monday.
Passenger Brian Jokat told CNN that the pilot said they lost control of the plane, causing the incident.
""I immediately engaged with him and said, 'What was that?' And he openly admitted, he said, 'I lost control of the plane. My gauges just kind of went blank on me,'"" Jokat told CNN.
There have been a few other recent instances as well, including a Boeing 777-200 that had a tire fall off shortly after takeoff in San Francisco on Thursday. The flight was re-routed to Los Angeles and landed without any injuries. A Boeing plane landing in Houston on Friday ran off the runway into a grassy area. Last week, a Boeing 737-900's engine caught fire some 20 minutes after takeoff, and videos of the incident, naturally, went viral.
This could be more folks noticing common relative incidents because Boeing is in the news already, but the fact remains there have been numerous incidents as of late.
Boeing whistleblower John Barnett found dead
John Barnett — a longtime Boeing employee who had been providing evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company — was found dead on Monday. The Charleston County coroner said the death was from a ""self-inflicted"" wound, the BBC reported.
Barnett, who had worked as a quality manager, had alleged that Boeing put workers under intense pressure which led to compromised safety. He did several interviews over the years alleging Boeing pushed aside safety procedures to keep things running smoothly.
The timing of Barnett's death has caused a lot of internet speculation, in ways that might be expected. As of right now, however, we don't know very many details about the 62-year-old's passing. Still, people are, in general, very suspicious of Boeing.

What now for Boeing?
Well, that's not clear. The company has to come up with a quality improvement plan per the FAA's orders.
""Boeing must commit to real and profound improvements,"" FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said last month. ""Making foundational change will require a sustained effort from Boeing's leadership, and we are going to hold them accountable every step of the way.""
However, the FAA hasn't specified how they would punish the company if it did not deliver results.
For now, customers seem to be taking things into their own hands. There have been a lot of posts from folks saying they'd no longer fly in a Boeing aircraft. And people are now using sites like Kayak to filter Boeing planes out of their travel plans.

A former Boeing employee who had been giving evidence in a whistleblower lawsuit against the company has been found dead in South Carolina, authorities said.
The death of John Barnett, 62, was confirmed by the Charleston County Coroner. The office said in a news release that he died from ""what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.""
Barnett worked at Boeing for 32 years and retired in 2017, the BBC reported. From 2010 to 2017, he worked as a quality manager at the airplane manufacturer's North Charleston plant. The plant manufactured the 787 Dreamliner, which was the subject of multiple whistleblower complaints.
Barnett told the BBC in 2019 that he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems on the long-haul jet. Boeing said that it had ""identified some oxygen bottles received from the supplier that were not deploying properly,"" the BBC said, but said that none of those defective bottles were ever installed.
Barnett also alleged that sub-standard parts that were set to be discarded were fitted to planes to avoid production delays, the BBC reported, and said that he believed the push to build new aircraft meant a rushed process that compromised passengers' safety. Barnett told the BBC that he had alerted managers to his concerns, but no action was taken. A panel of experts recently criticized Boeing's safety culture, telling the Federal Aviation Administration that there was a ""disconnect"" between Boeing's senior management and workers, and concerns of retaliation.
Boeing has denied Barnett's allegations, the BBC reported. A 2017 review by the Federal Aviation Administration did find that the location of at least 53 ""non-conforming"" parts in the North Charleston factory were unknown, mirroring one of Barnett's allegations, and ordered the airline to take remedial action.
Barnett had accused Boeing of denigrating his character and hampering his career. The manufacturer has denied these allegations.
Barnett was in Charleston this week to give a formal deposition in relation to a defamation lawsuit he had filed against Boeing, the BBC reported. He was expected to appear for further questioning on Saturday, but failed to appear. He was found dead in his truck in the hotel's parking lot, the BBC said.
Boeing said in a statement to CBS News that they were ""saddened by Mr. Barnett's passing,"" and said their ""thoughts are with his family and friends.""
Barnett's lawyers, Robert Turkewitz and Brian Knowles, told CBS News in a joint statement that Barnett ""was a brave, honest man of the highest integrity. He cared dearly about his family, his friends, the Boeing company, his Boeing co-workers, and the pilots and people who flew on Boeing aircraft. We have rarely met someone with a more sincere and forthright character.""
""John was in the midst of a deposition in his whistleblower retaliation case, which finally was nearing the end. He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn't see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it,"" the attorneys added. ""We are all devasted. We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.""
Barnett's family told CBS News in a statement that ""he was looking forward to having his day in court and hoped that it would force Boeing to change its culture.""
""He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to the hostile work environment at Boeing which we believe led to his death,"" the family said.
Boeing has drawn scrutiny for a series of recent incidents. On Monday, at least 50 people were injured by what officials described as a ""strong movement"" on a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner traveling from Sydney to Auckland, New Zealand.
In January, a door plug flew off an Alaska Airlines Boeing 737 Max shortly after the plane took off from Portland, Oregon, forcing an emergency landing. A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board suggested that four key bolts were not fitted. The incident is under investigation from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Justice Department.
Earlier this month, a United Airlines flight traveling from San Francisco to Japan had to make an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport after the Boeing 777 plane lost a tire shortly after takeoff. Meanwhile, an unspecified ""maintenance issue"" forced another United Airlines flight traveling from Australia to San Francisco to return to Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on Monday. That plane was a Boeing 777-300.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-barnett-boeing-whistleblower-death/

American Airlines is bringing a new fleet type to New York.
The Fort Worth-based carrier filed plans over the weekend to debut the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner at its John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) hub, as first seen in Cirium schedules and later confirmed by a carrier spokesperson.
American will deploy the 285-seat 787-9 Dreamliner on its New York to New Delhi route at the start of the IATA winter season on Oct. 27. It'll replace the existing Boeing 777-300ER operating this 7,318-mile daily service.
The airline will station additional Dreamliners at JFK in the coming months as it expands its pilot base in New York later this year to include 787 flying.
American shared the following statement with TPG about the change: ""This weekend, American Airlines adjusted the aircraft type operating between New York (JFK) and New Delhi (DEL) starting in October. We will continue to offer daily nonstop service on this route as we optimize our network and fleet.""
In recent years, American has exclusively deployed the Boeing 777 on long-haul routes from New York. However, with 30 Dreamliners entering the fleet over the next few years, American is clearly looking to diversify its capacity planning from New York.
In fact, American's new 787-9s, the first of which is expected to be inaugurated later this year, will feature a new ultra-premium configuration with 51 Flagship Business suites, 32 premium economy recliners, 18 Main Cabin Extra economy seats and 143 standard economy seats.
These jets will feature both a new business-class and premium economy product. If there's one market with enough premium demand to support these new seats, it's likely New York.
So far, American has only confirmed that its soon-to-debut new longest route from Dallas-Fort Worth to Brisbane, Australia, will be operated by one of these new Dreamliners.
That said, I'd expect the carrier to eventually base some of these planes in New York, where it can capitalize on all the local demand from businesses and deep-pocketed leisure travelers.
This is a strategy that United Airlines has popularized in recent years, especially with the introduction of its ""high J"" Boeing 767-300ER configuration. It features a whopping 46 Polaris business-class pods, 22 Premium Plus recliners and 99 economy seats, 43 of which are in an extra-legroom layout. United primarily bases this plane at Newark, where it can capitalize on all the premium demand from the local catchment area.
In the past, American has kept certain wide-body fleets based at different hubs. For instance, Philadelphia has exclusively seen Boeing 787 Dreamliners on its long-haul routes; before the pandemic, Miami was exclusively home to Boeing 777s for its transatlantic and South American routes.
But, American started flying the Dreamliner from Miami at the beginning of the pandemic.
American's current wide-body fleet consists of Boeing 777s (-200 and -300 variants) and 787s (-8 and -9 variants). Below, you'll find a breakdown of which long-haul jets are scheduled at each of the carrier's 10 hubs, based on Cirium timetables.
American's wide-body fleet by hub
- Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT): Boeing 777-200ERs only
- Chicago's O'Hare International Airport (ORD): Boeing 787-8 and Boeing 787-9
- Dallas Fort Worth International Airport (DFW): all fleets
- Los Angeles International Airport (LAX): all fleets
- Miami International Airport (MIA): all fleets
- New York's JFK: all fleets
- New York's LaGuardia Airport (LGA): none (no long-haul flights)
- Philadelphia International Airport (PHL): Boeing 787-8 and Boeing 787-9
- Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX): all fleets
- Washington, D.C.'s Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA): none (no long-haul flights)

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was en route from Sydney to Auckland Monday evening when it lurched earthward without warning, slinging some unrestrained passengers out of their seats and smashing others into the cabin ceiling.
""Everyone started screaming, crying,"" said Australian receptionist Ellie Addison, one of 263 passengers aboard flight LA800.
""People were launched out of their seats, there was blood pouring from people's faces.""
It is the latest in a string of headline-grabbing safety incidents to trouble U.S. plane maker Boeing.
Both Boeing and Chile-based LATAM Airlines have promised to cooperate with authorities to pinpoint the cause of the unspecified ""technical event.""
Confusion has clouded early investigations, with both Chilean and New Zealand safety watchdogs suggesting the other nation was taking the lead.
New Zealand accident investigators said Tuesday they had started gathering evidence, ""including seizing the cockpit voice and flight data recorders"".
But, a spokesman added, ""it is Chile's investigation.""
Sales administrator Veronica Martinez said it felt like the plane had stopped mid-air, and then ""we just plunged"".
""People were flying, babies fell, it was horrible, lots of people were injured,"" she told AFP.
Emergency crews raced to Auckland Airport to meet the incoming flight, dispatching more than a dozen ambulances and other medical vehicles.
Support worker Gabriel Felipe de Oliveira Adaime said the flight was ""traumatizing"", while fellow passenger Agustin Ramonda said it was ""one of the worst three seconds of my life"".
Paramedics said they treated about 50 patients. Four people remained in hospital as of Tuesday morning, Health officials told AFP.
The flight arrived on time, LATAM said in a statement.
'Black swan event'
Passenger Brian Jokat said he spoke to one of the pilots after the plane touched down.
""I asked him 'what happened?' and he said to me 'I lost my instrumentation briefly and then it just came back all of a sudden',"" the passenger told national broadcaster Radio New Zealand.
Air accident safety investigator Joe Hattley told AFP that technical problems were rare in modern aircraft.
""That flight record will be key to understanding this event,"" said Hattley, who also teaches at the University of New South Wales in Australia.
""It will tell investigators if it was an atmospheric event or a technical problem with the aircraft.""
Ashok Poduval, a commercial airline pilot for 15 years and now chief executive of the Massey University School of Aviation, said the incident appeared to be an ultra-rare ""black swan event.""
""A malfunction of the autopilot or unexpected clear-air turbulence are some of the possibilities that could cause an upset of this nature,"" he said.
Data from airline tracker FlightAware showed the plane began losing altitude about two hours into the three-hour flight. But it was unclear if this was part of its descent into Auckland.
Safety issues
U.S. manufacturer Boeing said it ""stands ready to support the investigation-related activities as requested.""
The aircraft maker has suffered a series of safety issues in recent years, including the fatal Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes of 737 MAX planes in 2018 and 2019 that killed more than 350 people.
The manufacturer is still reeling from a near-catastrophic incident in January when a fuselage panel on a Boeing 737 MAX 9 Alaska Airlines jet blew off mid-flight in the United States.
Last week, a Boeing 777 jetliner bound for Japan had to make an emergency landing shortly after takeoff from San Francisco when a wheel fell off and plunged into an airport parking lot, damaging several cars.
U.S. regulators earlier this month gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan addressing quality control issues, with the Federal Aviation Administration chief saying the company must ""commit to real and profound improvements.""
Boeing's share price has dropped 25% since the start of the year.
Upstream Aviation consultant Tim Collins said Boeing has had some production issues, ""but generally most aircraft are good and reliable.""
He said Boeing made up about 50% of the global jet fleet.
""While some people might think twice about Boeing's reputation, the same would happen if an Airbus crashed tomorrow.""",https://www.voanews.com/a/black-boxes-seized-after-technical-failure-on-boeing-made-latam-plane-/7523986.html

The flight, with 263 passengers and nine crew members, dipped dramatically into a nosedive for a couple of seconds and caused unbelted passengers to slam into the ceiling of the cabin. After stabilizing, the flight continued for another hour while the injured were tended to by doctors among the passengers on board.
After the Boeing jet touched down in Auckland, the passengers were met by paramedics and more than 10 emergency vehicles. Most of the injured were treated at the scene, while 13 people were taken to a hospital for treatment. One passenger was reported to be in serious condition.
Passenger Brian Jokat told the BBC, “The plane, unannounced, just dropped. I mean it dropped unlike anything I’ve ever experienced on any kind of minor turbulence, and people were thrown out of their seats, hit the top of the roof of the plane, throwing down the aisles.”
Jokat also told broadcaster RNZ that one passenger two seats away from him was not wearing a seatbelt when the plane dropped. Having dozed off, Jokat said, “I thought I was dreaming. I opened my eyes, and he was on the roof of the plane on his back, looking down on me. It was like The Exorcist.”
The LATAM Flight 800 was scheduled to continue on to Santiago, Chile, with a different plane. The airline released a statement saying, “LATAM regrets the inconvenience and injury this situation may have caused its passengers and reiterates its commitment to safety as a priority within the framework of its operational standards.” The airline company also referred to the incident as “a technical event during the flight which caused a strong movement.”
The midair nosedive and injury of passengers between Australia and New Zealand is the latest in a series of events on jets designed and manufactured by Boeing. There were four serious air safety incidents on United Airlines flights with Boeing planes last week.
These episodes took place two months after the midair door plug blowout on a Boeing 737-MAX plane operated by Alaska Airlines which is likely the result of unsafe maintenance procedures at the passenger jet manufacturer’s Renton, Washington, production facility.
On Monday, the New York Times reported that a six-week audit by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of the Renton operation had found dozens of problems in Boeing’s manufacturing process, as well as that of a key supplier, Spirit AeroSystems.
While the FAA had itself reported last week that there were “multiple instances” in which Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems had failed to comply with quality control requirements, the agency did not provide any specifics.
The Times report said that a slide presentation it had obtained “offers a more detailed picture of what the audit turned up.” The FAA conducted 89 product audits that examined the production process, and it failed 33 of these. There were “a total of 97 instances of alleged noncompliance, according to the presentation,” the Times report said.
Among the product audits were 13 conducted at Spirit AeroSystems—the company assembles the fuselage of the Boeing 737 MAX planes at its plant in Wichita, Kansas—in which it failed seven of these examinations. The Times reported that in one instance, Spirit mechanics used “a hotel key card to check a door seal,” and another instance where mechanics applied Dawn soap to a door seal “as a lubricant in the fit up process.”
Most of the failures found by the auditors were instances where “approved manufacturing process, procedure or instruction” were not being followed. Other issues dealt with maintenance of quality control documentation.
FAA administrator Mike Whitaker told the news media on Monday, “It wasn’t just paperwork issues, and sometimes it’s the order that work is done. Sometimes it’s tool management—it sounds kind of pedestrian, but it’s really important in a factory that you have a way of tracking tools effectively so that you have the right tool, and you know you didn’t leave it behind. So, it’s really plant floor hygiene, if you will, and a variety of issues of that nature.”
The comments from Whitaker, as well as the FAA findings at Boeing and Spirit, are plainly outrageous for their nonchalance and carelessness in the life-and-death matters related to aircraft manufacturing and safety of the traveling public, which depends on airplanes that are free from blowouts, sudden nose dives and crashes that kill everyone on board.
Two Boeing 737 MAX jets suddenly went into nose dives and crashed in Indonesia in 2018 and in Ethiopia in 2019 and killed all 346 passengers and crew members. These tragedies were caused by new automated navigation equipment on the planes that had not been adequately identified and pilots and staff inadequately trained for by Boeing.
The matter of safe manufacturing processes was very much on the mind of whistleblower John Barnett, 62, of Louisiana, who worked at Boeing for more than three decades. Beginning in 2017, Barnett began warning aviation authorities that Boeing was engaged in “catastrophic” safety failings.
On Monday, officials in Charleston, South Carolina, said that Barnett was found dead “from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.” Members of Barnett’s family issued a statement saying that he had tried to highlight serious concerns but was met with “a culture of concealment” that valued “profits over safety.”
Barnett was in Charleston to give deposition testimony in his federal legal action against Boeing with the case scheduled to come before an administrative law judge in June. His lawyers Brian Knowles and Robert Turkiewitz issued a joint statement on Tuesday, saying, “He was in very good spirits and really looking forward to putting this phase of his life behind him and moving on. We didn’t see any indication he would take his own life. No one can believe it.”
The lawyers called for a thorough investigation into Barnett’s death, stating, “We need more information about what happened to John. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public what they find out. No detail can be left unturned.” So far, the Charleston police officials are maintaining that there are no indications of “foul play” in the case.
Interviewed by the New York Times in 2017, Barnett said, “I haven’t seen a plane out of Charleston yet that I’d put my name on saying it’s safe and airworthy.” He filed a whistleblower complaint with federal regulators about his experiences at Boeing’s Charleston factory and accused the company of denigrating his character and hampering his career.
As we have analyzed previously on the WSWS, the growing crisis at Boeing is the byproduct of the drive for profitability and financial performance on Wall Street over quality of design, manufacturing precision and use of technology to eliminate safety issues in the air. Boeing, in cooperation with government agencies and airline manufacturing workers unions, has sped new planes to market, cut corners to reduce costs and imposed increased exploitation on production workers.
The catastrophic failure of Boeing’s 737-MAX planes that have killed hundreds of people can only be characterized as crimes because these events were entirely preventable. While no one has been held accountable for the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, Boeing, with a market capitalization value of $117.4 billion as of March 12, has maintained sweetheart arrangements with the investigatory, regulatory and criminal justice systems in the US that have encouraged a continuation of the practices that produce these catastrophes.
More fundamentally, the protection of the decision-makers behind the Boeing crashes is itself an expression of the collapse of the supremacy of American industry, which it had possessed in an earlier historical period when it emerged as the most powerful capitalist country in the world. The US ruling class is increasingly embracing criminality in all of its affairs, whether it be on Wall Street, on the factory floor or in the White House.",https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2024/03/13/tqga-m13.html

United Airlines Holdings Inc. has told Boeing Co. to stop building 737 Max 10 jets for the carrier, opting to switch to a smaller variant and the rival Airbus SE A321 until the U.S. plane-maker can pull the stretched single-aisle through its long-delayed certification.
“We’ve asked Boeing to stop building Max 10s, which they’ve done, for us and start building Max 9s,” United Chief Executive Officer Scott Kirby said Tuesday at a JPMorgan investor conference. “It’s impossible to say when the Max 10 is going to get certified.”
Once the Max 10 gets clearance to operate, United will switch back to the Max 10, Kirby said. The United CEO confirmed earlier Bloomberg reports that the airline is looking to swap out some of its massive order for 277 Max 10s to use the A321 instead, offering the European plane-maker the rare opportunity to seize an important piece of business from its chief rival.
“We are in the market for A321s, and if we get a deal where the economics work, we’ll do something,” Kirby said. “If we don’t, we won’t and will wind up with more Max 9s.”
Kirby has been one of Boeing’s most outspoken critics after a fuselage panel blew off of a 737 Max 9 operated by Alaska Air Group Inc. in early January. United, the biggest operator of the variant, temporarily took dozens of planes out of service while federal investigators probed the accident. The National Transportation Safety Board has found that workers at Boeing had failed to affix four bolts holding the door plug in place.
The bigger impact on United has been with the coming Max 10, for which it is the launch customer with 200 options in addition to the firm order. The plane’s certification, expected this year, has been pushed back indefinitely as Boeing addresses issues in its factory and contends with increased scrutiny from the Federal Aviation Administration and other U.S. agencies.
While Boeing deliveries this year will be “way behind” what the planemaker originally forecast, Kirby said he’s “glad that’s the case.” Boeing executives have accepted that they need to make larger changes and go slow for now, in order to eventually ramp up output.
“This is not a 12 month issue, this is a two-decade issue,” Kirby said. “I’d rather Boeing do what they need to do, and they are now.”",https://www.spokesman.com/stories/2024/mar/12/united-ceo-tells-boeing-to-stop-making-its-long-de/

CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCIV) — Robert Turkewitz, a lawyer for the now-dead John Barnett, said he's been working with him since 2017 when Barnett first raised the alarm about unsafe practices at Boeing.
Barnett was found dead Saturday, March 9, with what the Charleston County Coroner's Office described as ""a self-inflicted gunshot wound."" Turkewitz said he last spoke to Barnett the night before. He claimed he was in good spirits and was set to get a good night's sleep.
""John was a brave, honest man of the highest integrity, and it's a huge loss to his family and his friends and to those who knew him,"" Turkewitz said. ""John never met a stranger. He was just a great individual. He had the courage to do the right thing. Unfortunately, it's cost him the ultimate price.""
They had just started a month-long deposition process. Turkewitz said the case was going well and he was told that to Barnett.

Barnett then told him he was looking forward to getting back to his family in Louisiana after the deposition.
More depositions with Barnett were planned for that Saturday morning. When they woke to the torrential rainstorm on Saturday, Turkewitz called Barnett's hotel room repeatedly at the Holiday Inn on Savannah Highway.
When Barnett didn't answer, he called the hotel and asked if his truck was still in the parking lot. That's when he was told by a hotel staff member that the hotel was calling EMS.
Despite a note and a gun found at the scene, Turkewitz said he hopes that the police leave no stone unturned in this high-profile case.
""Does he have a target on him? I don't know the answer to that,"" Turkewitz said. ""Hopefully not, but I know that there are, I'm sure there were people who are angry at him for blowing the whistle.""
Turkewitz said Barnett's trial was for June of 2024. He said he plans to move forward with the trial and it will be the estate of John Barnett on the lawsuit.",https://abcnews4.com/news/local/john-was-a-brave-boeing-whistleblowers-lawyer-responds-to-news-of-his-death-john-barnett-boeing-news-abc-news-wciv-news-4-2024

A former Boeing employee who raised quality-control and safety concerns over the company’s aircraft production was found dead this week, according to authorities in South Carolina.
John Barnett, 62, was a quality manager with Boeing who retired in 2017 after several decades with the company. He died March 9 from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Charleston County coroner’s office said in a statement. The Charleston City Police Department is investigating, it added.
“We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends,” Boeing said in a statement.
Barnett had worked at Boeing’s factory in Everett before moving to South Carolina in 2010, according to The New York Times.
The Federal Aviation Administration and lawyers for Barnett did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a 2019 New York Times story, Barnett was described as one of several whistleblowers who raised quality issues at Boeing’s South Carolina plant where the company builds its 787 Dreamliner aircraft. Barnett said he had discovered clusters of metal shavings left near electrical systems for flight controls, which he said could have “catastrophic” results if the shavings penetrated the wiring.
Barnett said he repeatedly raised his concerns to his supervisors but was ignored and instead transferred to another part of the plant. Barnett later filed a whistleblower complaint with the FAA. In 2017, the FAA issued a directive requiring that 787s be cleared of shavings before delivery, according to the story.
A Boeing spokesman told the New York Times that safety issues are “immediately investigated and changes are made whenever necessary.”
Later in 2019, Barnett told the BBC that he had also uncovered problems with the aircraft’s oxygen systems, which could mean some breathing masks would not work in an emergency, and that workers under pressure to meet production targets had installed substandard parts on planes. Boeing denied the allegations.
Boeing is under fresh scrutiny after a door plug blew out midflight on an Alaska Airlines-operated 737 Max 9 in January. The blowout was linked to loose bolts and led the FAA to ground all Boeing 737 Max 9 planes with a door plug.
Last week, the FAA said its six-week audit prompted by the incident had identified several issues of noncompliance in areas including Boeing’s manufacturing process control and its parts handling. The agency said it has halted production expansion of the Boeing 737 Max and has given the company 90 days to come up with a plan to fix the issues.
Boeing’s 737 Max jets were previously grounded in 2019 when software forced down the noses of two new planes in a way their pilots could not overcome, causing two crashes that killed 346 people.

Touted by executives as “an excellent opportunity for suppliers to showcase their capabilities,” the summit is also an opportune chance for Boeing to network directly with suppliers, vendors, and global customers on aviation, weapons supply-chain logistics, and strategy.
Governor Jay Inslee has notably and openly sparred with Boeing over the company’s scorched-earth fight against unions, its dangerous cost-cutting, and its outsourcing of work. The Governor however celebrates the convening of DSS, going as far as lending a featured quote for the summit's site, noting that he’s “pleased to welcome back the international aerospace community to the center of US aviation and aerospace innovation - Washington state.”
But the warm welcome offered to DSS by Gov Inslee is not extended by all—especially not by those in Seattle’s anti-war, environmental, and human rights movements.
Boeing is currently the world’s third-largest weapons transnational corporation (W-TNC), and one of the foremost profiteers from armed conflict all over the world.
As the US military continues to set records as the world’s largest institutional carbon emitter, Boeing rakes in superprofit, having secured over $14 billion in US Department of Defense contracts in 2022 alone. The company's stock soared in the wake of Israel’s siege of Gaza in November as it secured a further $2.3 billion in US Air Force contracts for KC-46A refueling jets (which enable long-range aerial attacks seen in the recent US-bombings of Iraq and Syria) on top of an established KC-46 contract with Israel worth over $900 million. These refueling jets are nearly identical to 767 commercial jets and notably all to be built in Everett. Over 30,000 Palestinians have now been killed since reports broke on shipments of Boeing AI-guided “smart bombs” also being rushed to Israel, with artificial intelligence believed to be a reason for the speed of the massive death tolls amidst blockages of humanitarian aid.
While Jay Inslee and business interests may celebrate Boeing’s presence in our state, a coalition spearheaded by Resist US-Led War and endorsed by over 50 other community organizations are gathering to oppose the Boeing DSS convening on Tuesday March 12. In late January, the International Court of Justice delivered a preliminary decision supporting the “plausibility” of South Africa’s claim that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza, and protesters are especially outraged by Boeing’s defense aircraft and weaponry being sold to Israel. But Boeing’s perpetuation of war is global, including in countries like the Philippines, and it is therefore complicit in global loss of life, ecocide, and the climate crisis.
How is Boeing complicit in human death, ecocide and the climate crisis? Less than half of Boeing’s contracts are commercial. The rest relate to global services and defense, including attack helicopters, bomber planes, and nuclear weapons missiles. Its fighter jets in particular use massive amounts of fossil fuel, measured in gallons per mile, not the other way around.
Even if the US Air Force were to “go green” and fly on some alternative fuel, Boeing would still be hungry for the raw materials it needs to build and fly aircraft. The mining of bauxite ore, a key ingredient in aluminum production, destroys forests, soil, and water. Boeing’s commercial division alone utilizes up to 150 million pounds of aluminum annually, while workers in bauxite mining hubs such as Guinea experience severe environmental degradation and exploitation, at times even halting extraction due to mass protest.
Mining for lithium and cobalt, key ingredients of batteries used for Boeing’s products, also threaten land, water, indigenous culture, and international relations, globally and domestically here in the US. And there would be no abatement in Boeing’s global presence, which mirrors that of the US military.
US military interference and dominance in the Philippines has an especially long history since the US invaded the archipelago in 1899, and Philippine communities have been surviving and resisting that dominance for as long. The most recent Global Witness report on land defenders documented 177 killings of environmentalists in the 2022 calendar year; that total includes dozens of victims throughout South America, victims in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (where over 70% of the world’s cobalt is extracted), and a total of 11 killed in the Philippines, making it the most dangerous country in Asia for environmentalists (again) for the 10th straight year.
Seattle may also remember the impassioned plea of the Filipino delegate Yeb Saño at the 2013 COP in Warsaw, while his brother the environmentalist and peace activist A.G. Saño reported to him the devastation caused by super typhoon Haiyan laying waste to their community back home.
While Boeing has long been a beneficiary of billion-dollar arms deals with the Government of the Republic of the Philippines (GRP), abuses by the US-backed Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) against activists have only intensified in recent years. Since Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. came to power in June 2022, there have been increased instances of repression of indigenous land defenders, over 60,000 civilians impacted by indiscriminate bombings and firings by the AFP, and even abductions of youth environmental activists by GRP state forces, all as reported by the Philippine-based human rights alliance Karapatan in the last several months.
350 Seattle, the International Coalition for Human Rights in the Philippines (ICHRP), and the Climate Crisis and Militarism Project of Veterans for Peace are all part of the world-wide movement to mitigate the climate crisis and promote lasting peace and justice—climate, racial, and economic justice. Environmentalists and human rights activists everywhere should be concerned not only about the US military’s vast and largely unreported greenhouse gas emissions, but also its role providing military protection for oil corporations, and its squandering of trillions of dollars needed for addressing the climate crisis and people’s needs.
Meanwhile, people’s demands are holding the US government accountable for enriching W-TNCs such as Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and Boeing instead of doing the hard work of negotiating agreements and treaties to de-escalate conflict and address basic needs. Only through a just and lasting peace will communities worldwide recover, rebuild, and repair sustainable and reciprocal relationships with land, water, air, and each other.
Join us Tuesday to oppose Boeing and say “NO TO DSS”! “CUT TIES WITH BOEING”!

- The cockpit in the 747 underwent two significant upgrades, in the 747-400 and later, the 747-8.
- The Boeing 747 cockpit evolved from analog gauges to glass screens like the 747-400's CRTs.
- Modern Boeing 747-8 cockpit uses LCD screens, electronic checklists, and Electronic Flight Bags.
The Boeing 747 was introduced into service in 1970 and was in production for 55 years before being discontinued. During its impressive production run, Boeing produced more than 34 variants (both civilian and military), which is more than any other Jetliner.
Through the ages, technology improved drastically, and as a result, the 747 was upgraded at every turn. It extended the aircraft's longevity and ensured that flight crews had the latest equipment to keep flights safe and efficient. An area that evolved significantly was the cockpit, from analog gauges to a fully digital cockpit and everything in between.
Gauges and gauges
The 747-100 had no digital screens inside the cockpit and displayed information through analog gauges. Outside the typical flight instruments, the crew had to monitor hydraulics, electrics, powerplants, and more.
All the different gauges displayed different information and had to be monitored to ensure the safe operation of the aircraft. The engine panel alone had 16 gauges, four for each engine. As a result, there was another member of the flight crew: a flight engineer.
The flight engineer has to monitor 50 gauges as well as switches, lights, and circuit breakers, then filter the information to the pilots, allowing them to focus on flying. Many other aircraft at the time required a flight engineer, but the quad-engined 747 pushed the limits of their instrument scan.
One of the less talked about features of the Boeing 747-100 was the Inertial Navigation System (INS). The system was developed for the Apollo program and is now a mainstay on all jetliners. It removed the need for a flight navigator, which was common then.
Glass versus gauge
The 747-400 marks the second generation of the aircraft's cockpit. Six CRT screens and three Flight Management Computers (FMC) replaced many analog gauges.
The pilots each had two dedicated displays: a Primary Flight Display (PFD) for flight instruments and a Multi-Function Display (MFD), which showed other information such as maps, radar, and additional supplementary flight information. The Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) takes up the middle two screens and allows the pilots to monitor the aircraft's systems.
The three FMSs input the route, load, fuel, and other trip information. It uses the data to calculate the cruising airspeed, Mach number, and optimum altitude, among other things. The FMC is also used to input NAVAID and radio frequencies.
The breakthrough of glass cockpit technology and EICAS made the role of the flight engineer redundant, as the computers did most of the processing and only alerted the crew about abnormalities.
Dream cockpit
The next significant upgrade for the 747s cockpit was with the 747-8, which featured technology ripped straight out of Boeing's newest aircraft, the 787 Dreamliner. The new cockpit is more streamlined to reduce pilot workload and is equipped with all the bells and whistles you can think of. It is produced by association with Rockwell Collins.
Gone are the six old CRT screens. All of them have been replaced with Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs). The pilots still get two screens each, but the two EICAS screens have been consolidated into one screen, and the remaining screen is now called the electronic checklist. It contains all the checklists, reducing the amount of paper and documents the crew must carry. It also allows the airline to revise, update, and distribute checklists across the fleet.
Two screens can be added on either side of the cockpit, near the pilot's thighs. These two screens are part of the Boeing Class 3 Electronic Flight Bag (EFB), an option for the 747-8. The screens further reduce the crew's reliance on paper and allow the flight crew to seamlessly communicate with dispatchers and Air Traffic Control (ATC).
The three FMCs are retained but upgraded to meet new specifications and standards. The Rockwell Collins CISS 2100 configurable integrated surveillance system is integrated into the new avionics suite, which handles the Terrain Avoidance and Warning System (TAWS), Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and transponders.

Reddit (RDDT) is set to go public soon and is as of now, one of the most highly anticipated initial public offerings (IPOs) of 2024. The social media company, led by CEO Steve Huffman, is seeking a $6.5 billion valuation and is aiming to raise up to $748 million in the company's public offering.
Planned for March 21, the offering is imminent, and Reddit said last week that it will be selling 22 million shares at an expected price of $32.50 per share to help reach that aforementioned $748 million. Around 1.76 million shares of the stock have been isolated for Redditors — meaning they'll have the opportunity to buy separate shares at the initial offering price and can sell them when the IPO happens without delay. A mandatory six-month holding period is typical for early investors after a stock debut.
These isolated shares are mostly for the holders of Reddit accounts made before January 1, 2024, so if you're new to Reddit you can't get in on this. The offer to buy the stock applies to select users, moderators and then ""friends and family of various board members and employees,"" according to Yahoo Finance.

Back in February, select users were given invitations for the IPO with participants chosen based on their level of activity as forum moderators on the platform, or their ""karma"" scores, which reflect the perceived value of users' contributions and work as shorthand metrics for individual standing within the community. Users of Reddit who did not receive an invitation had the chance to sign up in advance to purchase shares in the IPO from March 1 to March 5. If the program reached its capacity before March 5, Reddit would initiate a waitlist.
Reddit's IPO launch has been in the works since the company first confidentially filed in 2021. Unsurprisingly, Redditors hate this move. Most heavy users seem to feel that the site is already suffering from Reddit's attempt to further monetize a platform that hasn't turned a profit in 20 years. This includes, most notably, Terms of Service changes in 2023, specifically to its API, that forced developers of very popular third-party Reddit apps to shut them down. Then there's the $60 million content licensing deal with Google that allows its AI to be trained on the sites data. Additionally, Reddit removed users' option to opt-out of personalized ads.
The relationship between Reddit and its free workforce of volunteer moderators is already in a precarious place, especially after many were removed from their subreddits after protesting the company's API changes. Thus, Reddit allowing moderators early dibs to its IPO can be thought of as an attempt to ""make good"" to those who feel slighted.
Many users' enthusiasm about grabbing the stock is not overwhelming, however. ""They failed to turn a profit as one of the most popular websites in the world for decades and their only path to profit now is selling access to the previously-not-profitable shitposts to scrapers who will feed it to their AI,"" wrote user DPSnacks on the r/investing Subreddit.

On Monday, in an update to its S-1 filing with the SEC, Reddit said the company and its investors will offer 22 million shares, expected to be listed at an IPO price of between $31 and $34 per share. The offering would give Reddit a top valuation of about $6.4 billion — less than the $10 billion it had been valued at in 2021 after a major round of funding. Based on the midrange price of $32.50 per share, Reddit said it expects to receive net proceeds from the IPO of about $450.9 million.
Reddit plans to use the money raised from the IPO for “general corporate purposes” as well as potentially to “in-license, acquire or invest in complementary technologies, assets or intellectual property.” The company noted that it has “no current commitments for any material acquisitions or investments at this time.”

Reddit intends to list its Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “RDDT.”
The company is offering 15.28 million shares of its Class A common stock and selling stockholders are offering an aggregate of 6.72 million shares. In addition, Reddit’s underwriters have reserved up to 1.76 million shares of stock (8% of the shares in the offering), for sale at the IPO price through a directed share program to “eligible users and moderators on our platform” as well as certain board members and “friends and family members of certain of our employees and directors.”
Reddit previously said it would grant users who have “meaningfully contributed to Reddit community programs” the chance to buy shares in the company at the IPO price. According to Reddit, users and moderators who created an account on or before Jan. 1, 2024, are potentially eligible for the directed share program. Those will be invited to participate in six phased “priority tiers,” based on that participant’s contributions to Reddit. Shares purchased through the directed share program will not be subject to the terms of the lock-up agreement or market standoff restrictions.
In its original IPO filing last month, Reddit reported 2023 revenue of $804.0 million, up 21% year over year, and a net loss of $90.8 million in 2023, compared with a $158.6 million loss the year prior. In December 2023, Reddit had more than 500 million visitors and in the fourth quarter had an average of 73.1 million daily active unique users worldwide. The company had 2,013 full-time employees as of the end of 2023, up from 1,942 a year earlier.
Reddit said that in January 2024 it entered into “certain data licensing arrangements” totaling $203 million with terms ranging from 2-3 years, with a minimum of $66.4 million of revenue to be recognized in calendar year 2024. “We believe our growing platform data will be a key element in the training of leading [artificial intelligence] large language models (‘LLMs’) and serve as an additional monetization channel for Reddit,” the company said.
Last month, Reddit and Google announced a pact under which the internet giant can use Reddit posts to train its AI models, which is worth about $60 million annually, Reuters reported. In addition, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is a major shareholder, owning 8.5% of Reddit’s current outstanding shares. According to the filing, Advance Publications (parent of Condé Nast, which formerly owned Reddit) owns 29.4% of outstanding shares, while China’s Tencent Holdings and Fidelity each own 9.5%.
Reddit CEO Steve Huffman owns 3.2% of the company’s outstanding shares and Reddit COO Jen Wong holds 1.5%, per the filing. Huffman’s compensation package for 2023 was worth $193.2 million, which included salary of $341,346, stock awards worth $98.3 million and stock options valued at $93.8 million. Wong’s total comp of $92.5 million included a base salary of $583,820, stock awards of $45.7 million and stock options worth $45.7 million.
The company in December 2021 confidentially submitted a draft registration statement with the SEC for a proposed IPO. Reddit was acquired by Condé Nast in 2006 for $10 million, soon after it launched in 2005. In 2011, Condé Nast spun out the site, while parent Advance Publications retained a minority stake. Other investors in Reddit include Vy Capital, Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz.",https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/reddit-ipo-stock-listing-valuation-1235938118/

The company and existing shareholders plan to sell about 22 million shares at a range of $31 to $34 per share, according to a filing released Monday. The projected market cap reflects a fully diluted share count, not just the shares that will immediately be outstanding.
Reddit has also set aside roughly 1.76 million shares for certain users and moderators, known as Redditors, who want to participate in the IPO and have created their user accounts before Jan. 1. The Redditors will be able to purchase those shares and then sell them on the open market as they won't be subject to a lock-up period, which typically prevents investors from selling shares for six months after the IPO.
Reddit filed its prospectus in February, and said it planned to go public on the New York Stock Exchange and trade under the ticker symbol ""RDDT."" Of the 22 million shares being issued in the offering, Reddit is selling about 15.3 million, which would mean raising $520 million at the top of the range. Existing stakeholders, including CEO Steve Huffman, plan to sell a combined 6.7 million shares.
Investors are closely watching Reddit's offering, which will be this year's first major tech debut and the first social media IPO since Pinterest went public in 2019.
In 2021, Reddit filed a confidential draft of its public offering prospectus with the SEC. During that same year, Reddit raised $1.3 billion in a funding round and had a private market valuation of $10 billion, according to the deal-tracking service PitchBook.
Reddit's annual sales in 2023 were $804 million, a 20% year-over-year increase from $666.7 million in 2022, according to the company's S-1 filing. It also recorded a net loss of $90.8 million for 2023, which was narrower than the $158.6 million net loss it logged a year earlier.
Some of the company's notable shareholders include Tencent, Condé Nast's parent company Advance Magazine Publishers and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who was a member of Reddit's board of directors from 2015 to 2022.
The company warned in its filing that Redditors who participate in its IPO ""could result in increased volatility in the market price"" of the company's Class A common stock. Other companies that have gone public and allowed certain community members and others to participate in their IPOs via similar directed share programs, include Doximity, Rivian and Airbnb.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/11/reddit-to-raise-nearly-750-million-in-upcoming-ipo.html

The number is below the $10 billion level achieved by the company during a 2021 fundraising round, with the disparity reflecting increased expectations for tech company profitability. The IPO would raise $748 million at the top of the price range, and only a small handful of companies have gone public in the U.S. this year in that lofty valuation range, which will make the offering a closely watched test of the market. At the midpoint of the range, on a net basis, the public listing will bring in about $451 million, the company estimated in an SEC filing.
Similar companies are worth quite a bit more than Reddit, a text-oriented, message-board-based social media firm. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms has a market value of almost $1.3 trillion, while Snap Inc. and Pinterest are each worth around $20 billion. San Francisco-based Reddit was founded in 2005.
Watch on Deadline
The ownership base of Reddit after the IPO is slated to include a few familiar media and tech names. Advance Magazine Publishers, the owner of Condé Nast controlled by the Newhouse Family, is set to have a 26.5% stake in the company, while China’s Tencent will have 9.7% and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 7.6%.
The IPO is set to happen later this month, with the company already having filed for a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol RDDT.
“We hope going public will provide meaningful benefits to our community as well. Our users have a deep sense of ownership over the communities they create on Reddit,” CEO Steve Huffman wrote in a letter included in Monday’s filing.
Huffman said the goal is for “our users to be our owners” via the IPO. “Becoming a public company makes this possible. With this in mind, we are excited to invite the users and moderators who have contributed to Reddit to buy shares in our IPO, alongside our investors.”

The announcement gives potential investors - including some Reddit users - additional information to evaluate if they want to buy stock in an IPO that will allow more retail investors than usual to participate because of its unusual structure.
Reddit, along with some existing stockholders, plans to offer 22 million shares of the company's Class A stock, meaning the IPO could raise as much as $748 million from those shares, according to an updated prospectus. The company officially announced its IPO last month.
Reddit itself expects to earn approximately $450 million in proceeds from the IPO, if shares are priced at the midpoint of its expected range. The company said it will use the funds for general purposes such as operating expenses, and potentially to license, acquire or invest in new technologies, assets or intellectual property.
Overall, Reddit is seeking a $6.4 billion valuation with the IPO. That's less than the $10 billion valuation that Reddit targeted when it announced its last funding round in 2021.
Some investors believe Reddit's listing could be a bellwether for the larger IPO market, which has been in a slump, with Wall Street hoping for a blockbuster listing that could revive dealmaking. And it could signal the current appetite among investors to buy shares in an unprofitable company after Reddit said last month it has not turned a profit in its nearly 19-year history.
Reddit reported a net loss of $90.8 million in 2023. However, the company said its sales are growing - revenue jumped 21% year-over-year in 2023 - and it's aiming to grow new lines of business, including licensing data to AI firms, to boost its bottom line.
The company also said it now has, on average, more than 73 million daily active users, as of the final three months of 2023, up from the 52 million daily active users it reported in 2021.
Reddit is taking the unusual step of giving a portion of those users the opportunity to become shareholders by reserving 8% of its IPO shares, or 1.76 million shares, for its most loyal Redditors. Users had until March 5 to pre-register to buy shares in the listing; those who did will have the chance to opt out of purchasing shares now that they have been priced.
The company has acknowledged that ""Redditors' participation in this offering could result in increased volatility"" in its stock price. Unlike the institutional investors who are typically involved in IPOs and tend to hold onto their investments for longer time periods, individual retail investors are more inclined to sell quickly, which could negatively affect the company's stock price once it is public.

The company said in a corporate filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that it planned to raise up to $748m by selling 22m shares valued at between $31 and $34 each in the largest initial public offering of a social media network in four years.
The news aggregation, content and discussion platform had confidentially filed for an IPO in 2021, but delayed its move because of economic conditions and a poor performance by technology stocks.
A flotation, under the ticker symbol RDDT, is expected some time this month and will be the most significant social media IPO since Pinterest in 2019.
Reddit, which has been described by its founders as “the front page of the internet”, said in the filing that it planned to invite users and moderators to participate in the flotation. It added that it had set aside 1.76m shares, 8% of the IPO, for sale to eligible Reddit users, certain members of its board, and friends and family of employees and directors.
Users who created their account before the start of this year, are over 18 and live in the US will be potentially eligible for the share programme, it said.
Reddit is a digital platform that allows users to join communities based on specific interests (or subreddits) and share experiences or reply to each other in comment threads on any topic. The company said it had 100,000 active communities and 1bn posts as of December 2023.
Its co-founder Steve Huffman said in a letter accompanying the filing that the flotation would allow users to also become Reddit investors as well as raising capital and offering “liquidity to our employees”. The company had reserved about 1% of its common stock to fund community-related programmes, he added.
Reddit said in December that it had hosted more than 500 million visitors that month and it believed there would be growth opportunities in advertising and data licensing as artificial intelligence and large language models expanded.
A filing last month showed that Reddit made a $90.8m loss in 2023, down from $158.6m in 2022, as its revenue increased by 21%.
Reddit’s users have previously pushed back against the platform’s policy changes and attempts at monetisation. After executives decided to begin charging for access to the site’s API last June, Reddit’s unpaid moderators led a revolt against the company that took more than 8,000 subreddit communities offline for days. The company’s IPO prospectus cited the incident among risk factors, saying that similar actions in the future “could adversely affect our business”.
As the flotation nears, the founder of the messaging platform Telegram has also announced that his company is exploring a potential IPO. Pavel Durov, Telegram’s Russian-born owner, told the Financial Times that the platform had grown to 900 million users, had been valued at $30bn and had no plans to sell.

If investors agree to pay its high-end range, its valuation should hit around $5.4 billion. At the low end of this range, $31 billion, though Reddit would be worth $4.93 billion based on an expected 158.98 million shares outstanding. Others have calculated a potential valuation of closer to, or over, the $6 billion mark by including options held by employees or others.
In any case, everyone seems to believe it will emerge as a public company at or above the $5 billion mark, something of a Mendoza Line for Reddit, given the clues its secondary-market trading activity showed on pricing prior to its IPO filing.
With $804.0 million in 2023 revenue, Reddit is on track to trade for a multiple of 6.9x to 8x its revenue, depending on the valuation estimate you want to use. And this multiple could be even bigger if investors agree to go higher than the $34-per-share range after its roadshow with them.
Given that Reddit is an unprofitable, long-established social media company, and one that depends on advertising, that feels a tad expensive. Unprofitable Snap, for example, is currently worth 4.34x its revenues while highly profitable Meta is worth 9.86x its own trailing revenues, according to Yahoo Finance.
Reddit’s game plan for AI is one good reason why it’s pricing its shares closer to Meta than Snap.
Reddit sold $203 million worth of contracts to AI companies for access to its data earlier this year. Per the filing:

We are also in the early stages of monetizing our emerging opportunity in data licensing by allowing third parties to access, search, and analyze data on our platform. In January 2024, we entered into certain data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203.0 million and terms ranging from two to three years. We expect a minimum of $66.4 million of revenue to be recognized during the year ending December 31, 2024 and the remaining thereafter. Reddit data constantly grows and regenerates as users come and interact with their communities and each other. We believe our growing platform data will be a key element in the training of leading large language models (“LLMs”) and serve as an additional monetization channel for Reddit.
While this didn’t reveal the buyer in such a contract, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has an 8.7% stake in Reddit, making him the third-largest shareholder. He was also once a member of the company’s board of directors.
Reddit is a treasure trove of exactly the kind of training data that always-hungry, large language model AI companies need thanks to its long history, huge user footprint, and active, crowd-sourced creation of written material. And Reddit has already proven that it can rip revenues out of AI companies in exchange for access to this trove.
True, some Reddit users are concerned about AI and the company as a pair, but those concerns might not hold much sway compared to the potential revenue unlock that Reddit could see from its data.
Investors might consider Reddit a side bet on AI itself, even if the company’s core business isn’t creating AI models. And Reddit is accumulating new data by the hour. That’s good for Reddit’s future. As the axiom goes: If you want to get rich during a gold rush, be the one selling picks and shovels.",https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/11/reddit-ipo-share-price-plans/

Reddit users will be able to buy shares in the social media platform when it goes public next week.
Dubbed the ""front page of the internet"", Reddit is ""gearing up for its much-anticipated stock market debut"". It could reach a valuation of up to $6.4 billion (£5 billion) in its US initial public offering (IPO), said City A.M..
Traders and the ""historic"" New York Stock Exchange trading floor will be ""decked out in Reddit's white and orange colour scheme"" for the IPO, sources have told the Financial Times. But the company has never made a profit and some commentators believe it does not make for an attractive investment.

What is Reddit?
Reddit, which was founded almost two decades ago, is an online forum where users can post questions and comment on subjects that interest them. It hosts thousands of niche discussion groups, called subreddits, which are set up and moderated by volunteers.
It has become the ""internet talking shop"", said The Times. ""With its basic style and quirky, sometimes offensive threads"", it ""feels like a throwback to the early days of the internet"". Visiting it is ""rather like being in a digital pub"", except with ""more readily available pornography"".
Reddit has ""often courted controversy"", including in 2021 when its users sent the share price of GameStop, a struggling video games business, up by more than 700% during four ""frantic days of trading"" under a thread entitled WallStreetBets.
Why is it floating?
Reddit has recorded losses every year since its launch, including more than $90 million last year. It makes most of its income (its revenue was $804 million last year) through advertising, although it recently agreed a deal with Google that allows the technology giant to access Reddit data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.
A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com
So the platform is ""trying to secure an anchor investor as it pitches its fast-growing advertising business and the promise of revenues from selling its data"", said the FT.
But the forum's users have a ""deep sense of ownership over the communities they create on Reddit"", wrote co-founder Steve Huffman in a letter to prospective investors. The company wants ""this sense of ownership to be reflected in real ownership – for our users to be our owners. Becoming a public company makes this possible.""
What does it mean for the future?
Reddit plans to price its initial public offering on 20 March and start trading the following day, two sources told the Financial Times. ""The company is targeting between $31 and $34 a share, translating to a valuation of as much as $6.5bn.""
The high valuation earns Reddit an ""Unattractive Stock Rating"", said Forbes. The magazine expects a $5 billion valuation, and while this is half the $10 billion private market valuation seen in 2021 when interest rates were zero and money was cheap, it ""remains much too high"", it said.
The company ""has never been profitable and should not be a publicly traded company"" as it ""may never monetize its platform without angering its users"". Its business model is ""inescapably built on a catch-22: make money or please users"".
This view was bolstered by the reactions of some Reddit users, said the BBC. When news of the IPO broke last month, users wrote that it was the ""beginning of the end"", ""good while it lasted"", and said the site's owners had ""ruined it"".
In an IPO filing to US regulators last month, Reddit revealed its losses had come down to $90.8 million (£72 million) while revenues had grown by 21% to $804 million (£634 million) in 2023. Therefore, said the FT, its debut will be ""closely watched"" as a ""gauge of the appetite for tech listings"".

Reddit, the website known as the “front page of the internet,” is seeking a valuation of $6.4 billion for its upcoming U.S. initial public offering (IPO).
The social media platform’s IPO has been years in the making and should serve as a bellwether for the IPO market in 2024 following a series of disappointments in 2023.
Reddit updated its S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday, which unveiled the valuation, shares offered, and the target price. Reddit aims to sell 22 million shares, with an anticipated price target of between $31.00 and $34.00 per share. The updated S-1 states:
“We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $450.9 million (or $552.7 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $32.50 per share, which is the midpoint of the estimated price range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.”
Previously, Reddit, which aims to trade under the ticker “RDDT,” was valued at $10 billion in a private fundraising round back in 2021. The nearly 50% haircut is likely more from the market itself rather than anything specific to Reddit. Last year, many IPOs flopped and traded below their listing prices, including Instacart (CART) and Birkenstock (BIRK).
Reddit is made up of communities called subreddits where users discuss anything from news and politics to carpentry and home renovations. However, there is also WallStreetBets, a subreddit notorious for the meme stock craze of 2021.
The subreddit mainly focuses on options trading but favors risky plays that often make or break someone’s account. There have been numerous posts of users screenshotting trades that have either resulted in massive gains or a blown-up account.
In fact, the subreddit is already filled with posters looking at shorting the stock, and while RDDT won’t have options for the first week, traders may attempt to short the shares—assuming they can find lendable shares in the first week. In any case, all eyes will be on RDDT when it starts trading on March 21.

Reddit, one of the most popular websites in the world, is hoping for a valuation of up to $6.4bn (£5bn) when its shares go public next week.
The social media company, which has never made a profit, will float shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
A filing in the US revealed that Reddit and its investors are hoping to sell 22 million shares for between $31 and $34 each.
However, many users worry the move will fundamentally change the website.
Some shares will be specially reserved for some Reddit users and moderators.
The company is planning an initial public offering (IPO) which would make some of its shares publicly available to buy for the first time.
""Our users have a deep sense of ownership over the communities they create on Reddit,"" wrote co-founder Steve Huffman in a letter to prospective investors released a few weeks ago.
""We want this sense of ownership to be reflected in real ownership - for our users to be our owners. Becoming a public company makes this possible.""

The company makes most of its money through advertising on the platform, although it recently struck a deal with Google which allows the tech giant to access Reddit data to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models.
Reddit has recorded losses every year since its start, including more than $90m last year.
The valuation is also far less than the $10bn at which it was valued in a private fundraising round in 2021.
Currently, the biggest shareholders include media company Advance Magazine Publishers, Chinese tech firm Tencent, US investment firm Fidelity, and Sam Altman, the chief executive of ChatGPT makers OpenAI.
A website built on its users
Reddit, founded in 2005, has a different feel compared with other social media companies such as Facebook or TikTok.
Users often feel freer to write what they like, although subreddits are policed by moderators.
The power of Reddit communities has been seen through examples such as the Gamestop saga in 2021, where users mobilised to drive up the share price of the US video game retailer.
Shares which were initially worth $20 shot up to a peak of $350 after co-ordination from Redditors.
However, some users are worried that the IPO would change the site for the worse.
""When the most important customers shift from [users] to shareholders, the product always [suffers],"" said one person.

And the online message board is giving its users a slice of the action.
Earlier this month, some of Reddit’s most active users, called redditors, logged into their accounts to find a message asking if they wanted to own a piece of Reddit in its IPO. Those users had until March 5 to indicate their interest in purchasing stock at the same price as institutional investors, the far more usual buyers of newly public shares.
Redditors now have until March 18 at 11:59 p.m. to complete their applications, create a brokerage account with a partner bank, and add funds to it to cover their stock purchase, according to an email sent to a participating redditor viewed by Fortune.
The company plans to set the IPO price, expected between $31 and $34 per share, on March 20 after 5 p.m., the email reads. Redditors will have from then until the next morning—March 21 at 7 a.m.—to make their purchases, the company expects. The Financial Times previously reported Reddit’s stock will begin trading on March 21, citing two sources with knowledge on the matter. The latest email to certain redditors appears to confirm that date.
Reddit declined to comment.
Reddit has been toying with a public market launch since December 2021, when it filed confidentially for an IPO. Last month, the company made a public filing for a market debut.
The directed share program is described as “an opportunity for redditors who have contributed to making Reddit what it is today,” the company said. Since there are a limited number of shares available through this program, Reddit is making the offer to only a select number of users. It is unclear what metrics Reddit used to decide who is eligible. The company did not disclose how many shares it has set aside for each individual or the group to purchase.
Reddit isn’t the first company to offer this kind of share-purchasing incentive to users. When Airbnb went public in 2020, it offered some U.S.-based hosts the option to buy shares at the IPO price of $68 each. When trading started, the stock soared to $146, and it is now worth $163. Uber also offered a directed share program in 2019, in which certain drivers could buy shares at $45. Though the stock opened lower than the IPO price at $42 and eventually fell to $20, it’s now at $77.50.

- The company and its investors are planning to sell 22 million shares, with a pricing range of $31 to $34.
- At the top end of the valuation range, the offering would raise $748 million.
The social-media platform Reddit has announced more details for what's expected to be one of the biggest initial public offerings of the year.
The company and its investors are planning to sell a combined 22 million shares at a price of $31 to $34 apiece, according to a Monday Securities and Exchange Commission filing. A pricing at the top end of that range would yield $748 million in proceeds. About 15.3 million of the 22 million shares are set to be sold by the company. The rest will be sold by the other investors, who are Reddit employees.
Reddit's expected pricing range sets a fully diluted valuation range between $5.8 billion and $6.4 billion, marking a sharp decrease from the $10 billion private valuation the company achieved in its last funding round, in August 2021.
In an attempt to attract the retail traders that have made its r/WallStreetBets forum such an influential force, Reddit has reserved 8% of the total shares on offer for users and moderators who created accounts before January 1, as well friends and family of various board members and employees. Those shares won't be under lockup, meaning their owners can sell their shares on the first official trading day.
Reddit's IPO has been in the works since 2021. That was at the peak of the meme-stock mania, when troves of retail investors active on subreddits such as r/WallStreetBets executed short squeezes on stocks including GameStop and AMC, driving prices ""to the moon.""
Wall Street will be closely watching Reddit as a signal for how the overall IPO market is doing. The landscape has been shaky lately, with offerings from Birkenstock to Instacart failing to get strong traction.",https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-ipo-valuation-price-range-sec-wallstreetbets-meme-stocks-2021-2024-3

- Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has a sizable stake in the company.
- Here's how much Altman's Reddit stake could be worth — and why it's not as much as some say.
Reddit, which is set to go public later this month, announced its target share pricing on Monday — and Sam Altman stands to reap a sizable windfall.
While his personal shares aren't worth the nearly half a billion dollars that has been reported, they do amount to a fortune.
Business Insider estimates that the OpenAI CEO owns a maximum of just about 1.66 million shares of Reddit. With the company's estimated price per share at $31 to $34, Altman's stake in Reddit could be worth between $51.4 million and $56.4 million.
Neither Reddit nor Altman would comment on the exact number of shares that Altman owned.
Altman has several ties to Reddit: He served on its board, had an eight-day stint as its CEO, and has invested in the company through five of his investment vehicles.
The company's S-1 says ""entities affiliated with Sam Altman"" own an 8.7% stake in the company, made up of 789,456 class A shares and 11,369,103 class B shares.
News outlets, including BI, were quick to say that Altman owned all these shares when Reddit filed an earlier version of its S-1 in late February. But the truth is far more complicated.
The company's registration statement says Altman ""disclaims beneficial ownership of these shares except to the extent of his respective pecuniary interest therein.""
Basically, just because the shares are affiliated with Altman doesn't mean they are his. Instead, they belong to his various funds, such as Hydrazine Capital II, a venture-capital fund, and Apollo Projects SPV-B, a special-purpose vehicle.
For instance, Hydrazine Capital II owns nearly 9.9 million shares of Reddit. But the fund's disclosure form indicates that Altman owns, at most, 5% of these shares — or about 500,000 — with the rest presumably belonging to the fund's limited partners, whose identities are unknown.
Applying this method to all of Altman's investment vehicles with ties to Reddit finds that Altman, the individual, owns as much as 1.66 million shares in the company.
His ties to Reddit point to Altman's long history as an investor.
While he's best known as the CEO of ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, Altman poured both his own money and that of at least one Silicon Valley power broker (Peter Thiel is reportedly the backer of one of his VC funds) into everything from a nuclear-fusion company to a bioscience upstart looking to delay death.
He has made over 155 investments since 2010, according to PitchBook data, and announced his investment in Reddit in 2014.
""I have been a daily reddit user for 9 years — longer than pretty much any other service I still use besides Facebook, Google, and Amazon,"" Altman wrote on his blog. ""I was probably in the first dozen people to use the site, and I shudder to imagine the number of hours I have spent there.""",https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-sam-altman-gain-reddit-ipo-shares-worth-2024-3

Posted Mar 12, 2024 10:44:37 AM.
Last Updated Mar 19, 2024 11:10:07 AM.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Reddit, that vast, lively and sometimes chaotic repository of internet discussion, is expected to carry a valuation up to $6.4 billion when it conducts its initial public offering on the stock market.
The offering also makes Reddit one of the first online companies to offer shares to its contributors — the “Redditors” who comment on its boards and the moderators who manage them. That’s a break with traditional IPO practice, in which initial shares are typically sold to institutional investors and fund managers who then begin trading the stock on the open market. Adding the company’s users to the mix could make for a much livelier offering, and not necessarily in a good way.
It could be an interesting ride.
WHAT ARE THE DETAILS OF THE IPO?
Reddit plans to list 22 million shares at a price between $31 and $34, according to the latest version of the IPO prospectus it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company stands to take in between $473.6 million and $519.4 million from the sale of roughly 15.3 million shares.
Reddit’s existing investors will sell an additional 6.7 million shares in the offering, raising between $208.4 million and $228.6 million for their own portfolios. Reddit itself won’t benefit from those sales.
Per standard IPO operating procedure, those shares will typically end up with a mix of mutual funds, hedge funds and other major investment groups who will then hawk them to their investor customers.
WHAT’S DIFFERENT ABOUT THE REDDIT IPO?
Reddit also plans to sell up to 1.76 million shares — roughly 8% of the total offering — to a mix of certain board members and so-called “friends and family members” of certain board members and employees. Plus, of course, the moderators and Redditors who make Reddit what it is.
The wild card here is that these stock purchasers, who will pay the IPO price for their shares, won’t be bound by “lock-up agreements” that require company officers and employees to hold their shares for a fixed period of time — potentially as long as six months. That means Redditors and moderators will be able to sell their shares immediately if they wish.
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THIS SETUP?
For starters, think share-price volatility.
While it’s not clear from the perspective just how many of those 1.76 million shares will end up in the hands of Reddit users, the number is likely large enough for those users to exert meaningful pressure on Reddit’s share price. The main concern is that a surge of demand for shares that aren’t locked up could create a sudden run-up in the share price, followed by an equally sharp decline once the initial excitement wears off and short-sellers — investors who effectively place bets that a stock will decline — begin to gather.
That’s pretty much what happened with Robinhood Markets, which operates a simple-to-use and low cost trading platform aimed at novice investors that also offered IPO shares to its users. The company’s stock opened at $38 on its first day of trading in July 2021, shot up to $85 five days later, then plunged back to roughly $40 after just six weeks.
“Mishandling this process could result in (Reddit) alienating their most ardent supporters, potentially turning them into critics,” warned Deiya Pernas, co-founder of Pernas Research.
But Don Montanaro, president of the trading platform Firstrade, argues that Reddit may not have had much choice but to go this route. “They’ve been running a business where their clients, their users, are their product,” he said. “It’s a case of, ‘What else could we do? This is who we are, how could we not offer this to these people?’”
CAN I GET IN ON THIS OFFERING?
If you don’t already have a Reddit account, you’re probably out of luck. The offering is only available to users who had established accounts as of January 1, 2024.
Beyond that, shares will be distributed to Redditors and moderators via a formula that accounts for their measurable contributions to the discussion boards. Redditors with high “karma” scores — a measure of their contributions to the community, such as posts that other Redditors find useful, amusing or insightful — will be grouped into six priority tiers for access to the stock offering.
Moderators who have taken significant numbers of “moderator actions” will likewise be sorted into those tiers. Such actions can include anything from designing a new discussion group — aka a “subreddit” in the jargon of the site — to removing spam or duplicate posts, to enforcing subreddit rules. Moderators will also be rated on membership trends in their subreddits.
None of this guarantees an individual a chance at buying shares if demand exceeds supply, although Reddit emphasizes in the prospectus that anyone who isn’t awarded a shot at purchasing shares can join a waitlist.
ANY OTHER RISKS I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?
Reddit has not had a profitable year since it was founded in 2005. After losing nearly $159 million in 2022, the platform generated $804 million in sales last year, up nearly 21% from 2022, narrowing its losses to about $91 million.
In its filing, Reddit’s leadership did list several avenues of revenue it’d like to expand on in order to reach profitability, including an interest in business deals where AI companies pay to access databases of human-written text that AI models can use to refine their ability to converse, answer questions and produce written work and images on request.
But the company said Friday that the Federal Trade Commission has opened an inquiry into the platform’s dealings in this space.
“Given the novel nature of these technologies and commercial arrangements, we are not surprised that the FTC has expressed interest in this area,” Reddit wrote in the filing. “We do not believe that we have engaged in any unfair or deceptive trade practice.”

The social media platform and some of its current shareholders plan a sale of 22 million shares for $31 to $34 each, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information wasn’t public yet. The company was seeking a valuation of as much as $6.5 billion in the listing, Bloomberg News has reported.
The people said the company is setting aside about 1.76 million shares in the IPO to be bought by users and moderators who created accounts before Jan. 1. Those shares won’t be subject to a lockup period, meaning the owners can sell them on the opening day of trading, according to Reddit’s filing in February with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
A representative for Reddit declined to comment.
Reddit’s more than two-year slog to listing reflects the ups and downs of the market, beginning with its initial confidential filing in 2021, when IPOs on US exchanges set an all-time record of $339 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Reddit raised funds that year valuing it at $10 billion, and Bloomberg News reported the following year that it could be valued at as much as $15 billion in an IPO.
Meanwhile, IPOs in the US tumbled, reaching only $26 billion last year, the data show. In January, Bloomberg News reported that Reddit was weighing feedback from early meetings with potential IPO investors that it should consider a valuation of at least $5 billion.
The company is a high-profile addition to the year’s roster of new and soon-to-be public companies. The biggest of those listings was the $1.57 billion offering by Amer Sports Inc. in January. Astera Labs Inc., a software maker focused on artificial intelligence, said in a filing Friday that it would seek up to $534 million in its IPO, which will likely proceed with Reddit’s.
Reddit’s listing will be watched closely by IPO candidates such as Microsoft Corp.-backed data security start-up Rubrik Inc. and health-care payments company Waystar Technologies Inc. Their deliberations come after a quartet of US listings led by semiconductor designer Arm Holdings Plc’s $5.23 billion offering in September failed to ignite a lasting rebound in the market.
Founded in 2005, Reddit averaged 73.1 million daily active unique visitors in the fourth quarter, according to its February filing. The company reported a net loss of $91 million on revenue of $804 million in 2023, compared with a net loss of about $159 million on revenue of $667 million a year earlier.
Reddit’s largest shareholder is Advance Magazine Publishers Inc., part of the Newhouse family publishing empire that owns Conde Nast, which bought Reddit in 2006 and spun it out in 2011.
Reddit said its millions of loyal users and moderators pose risks as well as a benefit for the company. Redditors have a historically combative relationship with the site, launching revolts over everything from racism on the platform to executives’ staffing decisions.
Thousands of members of the WallStreetBets forum — which boasts around 15 million users and helped popularize meme stocks like GameStop Corp. — voted to boost a forum post about shorting Reddit’s stock when it begins trading. Their reasons varied from the company’s lack of profitability to competitive concerns.
The IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., according to Reddit’s filing. The company plans for its shares to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RDDT.
Reddit co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Steven Huffman said in a signed letter included in the filing that the company has many opportunities to grow both the platform and the business.
“Advertising is our first business, and advertisers of all sizes have discovered that Reddit is a great place to find high-intent customers that they aren’t able to reach elsewhere,” Huffman said. “Advertising on Reddit is rapidly evolving, and we are still in the early phases of growing this business.”
Reddit said it’s in the early stages of allowing third parties to license access to data on the platform, including to train artificial intelligence models. The company said that in January it entered into data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of $203 million and terms ranging from two to three years. It expects a minimum of $66.4 million of revenue from those agreements this year, according to the filing.
Reddit also has announced a deal with Alphabet Inc.’s Google, allowing Google’s AI products to use Reddit data to improve their technology. Large language models often need vast troves of human-generated content to improve.
Huffman owns shares giving him 3.5% of the voting power. That includes Class B shares that will have 10 votes each compared with one each for the Class A shares to be sold in the IPO, the filing shows. Huffman also has a voting proxy agreement with Advance.
Other large shareholders include Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Wong, as well as FMR LLC and entities affiliated with OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman, Tencent Holdings Ltd., Vy Capital, and Quiet Capital and Tacit Capital, according to the filing.
Huffman’s fellow co-founder, venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian, isn’t listed among the investors with stakes of 5% or more and isn’t named elsewhere in the filing.

That’s why one brave Reddit user took to the r/bartenders subReddit channel to pose the question: “What is your go-to shot and beer combo?”
Some commenters shared their tried-and-true favorites, while others offered innovative twists on the classics or regional favorites. Whether you’re looking for the best bottom-shelf sets or a more elevated combination, here are the 10 best beer and shot combos, according to Reddit.
Four Roses Whiskey and Pilsner
While beer and whiskey combos (better known as boilermakers) are quite popular, we usually think of the beer as a means of washing down the bourbon. This Reddit user seems to think of it the other way around — a true visionary.

Bud and Fernet
Fernet is a popular choice for shots, since the mint-forward amaro is refreshing and lower in ABV than a typical spirit. Washing the Fernet down with a Budweiser makes the shot all the more quaffable and lovable.

Who's going pro?
More than 200 companies have included Reddit Pro in their digital strategy so far. These companies include well-known brands like Taco Bell and Wendy's, players in sports and media like the NFL and The Wall Street Journal, as well as disruptive brands like Kate Somerville and Atlas Headrest. The platform observed that partners generated 11 extra posts and comments per month on average and saw a +35% increase in monthly upvotes of their organic content in our early alpha testing with a smaller group of about 20 businesses.

I think it’s been a year now. Any rumors or news?
Here’s what I know, without the rumors. It’s for sale for $5,950,000 and available for lease, according to the listing.
The 49,803-square-foot building — with 14 screens — does not necessarily have to be used as a movie theater, said Scott F. Harrell the listing agent. Scott Harrell and his brother, Mark Harrell are listing the property.
When it was built in 2008, Scott Harrell tells me, it was constructed so that the stadium-style seating could be changed to one, flat single-level floor.
“So it’s designed for an exit strategy, should it ever cease to be a theater,” Harrell says.
In terms of Springfield zoning classifications, he adds, the building — should it change function — could be used for various purposes, such as office space, health and fitness, a restaurant, entertainment and maybe even a church.
“We’re just actively seeking the best use to complement the downtown that makes economic sense for the developer and owner,” Harrell says.
To be clear, Harrell adds, there has been interest in a potential buyer continuing to use it as a movie theater.
“We’ve had interests; we’ve just not come to terms,” he tells me.
The structure was built by developer Scott Tillman. It opened as a Hollywood Theater as part of the City of Springfield’s $8.6 million College Station project that also included a parking garage and retail space.
The original plan was for the two grassy areas on either side of the entrance to become restaurant and retail space. That never happened — at least not yet.
The Regal Hollywood, 415 W. College St., suffered in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when many movie fans did not want to go out in public in a group setting. This was true worldwide.
In 2022, the parent company was Cineworld Group, which declared bankruptcy.
The Regal Hollywood’s last day was Jan. 5, 2023. Since then, the only movie theater north of Battlefield Road in Springfield is the Moxie Cinema, a non-profit, independent theater, at 305 S. Campbell Ave., No. 101.

It’s a type of computed tomography (CT) scan known by several names, including a coronary calcium scan. The American Heart Association calls it a CAC test, short for coronary artery calcium.
By providing a “calcium score” based on the level of calcium buildup in your coronary arteries, a CAC test is used to help determine your risk of heart disease, heart attack, and/or stroke. The noninvasive scan can detect early-stage coronary artery disease, typically before symptoms develop.
Last week, Altimeter Capital founder and CEO Brad Gerstner posted on X (formerly Twitter), “Get a Calcium CT Scan of your arteries – $100 / 30 mins can save your life.” Ohanian quoted the post, adding, “I did this last year. Probably the highest ROI $100 you can spend on your health.”
When plaque builds up in the blood vessels that feed your heart, a process called atherosclerosis, chest pain, or a heart attack may result, Dr. Joseph Ebinger, associate director of the Coronary Intensive Care Unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, tells Fortune. The blockage begins as soft plaque, made up of cholesterol deposits and other substances. But in an attempt to “wall off” the soft plaque, your body eventually develops calcium around it, Ebinger explains.
“Calcium is like a bone-type material—it’s really hard,” Ebinger tells Fortune. “That shows up on noncontrast CT scans and allows us to be able to quantify the amount of calcium that’s built up on the coronary arteries.”
He adds, “There are very clear epidemiologic studies that have shown a relationship between the presence and the degree of coronary artery calcification and the risk of future cardiovascular events.”
I did this last year. Probably the highest ROI $100 you can spend on your health. https://t.co/k45vgLGsBj— Alexis Ohanian 🇦🇲 (@alexisohanian) March 3, 2024
Should I get a calcium score test?
It may be helpful to think of the CAC test as a Goldilocks procedure; it’s designed for people at not low or high, but moderate risk of cardiovascular disease.
“If you have a super-low risk because you are 25, never smoked, have well-controlled cholesterol, your risk of a cardiovascular event is really low. [A CAC test] is not going to help you,” Ebinger tells Fortune. “That said, if you are 70 and you have high cholesterol, you are a smoker, and you have high blood pressure, coronary calcium scanning is not going to help you a lot either… I’m going to treat you as if you’re high-risk.”
A CAC test won’t provide additional insight for patients who have already had a heart attack, coronary stent, or coronary bypass surgery, according to the American Heart Association (AHA). In addition, repeat testing isn’t beneficial for people who have gotten abnormal results in the past.
The AHA urges people to become familiar with their likelihood of a heart attack, including these “traditional” risk factors:
- Diabetes
- High blood pressure
- High cholesterol
- Overweight or obesity
- Smoking
“Risk-enhancing” factors include:
- Chronic inflammatory conditions
- Chronic kidney disease
- Family history of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
- Younger than 55 in men
- Younger than 65 in women
- High-risk ethnicity
- Heart disease risk is higher among American Indian, Mexican American, native Hawaiian, and some Asian American people
- Black people have disproportionately high rates of more severe blood pressure, which they develop earlier in life
- Higher-than-normal triglycerides, ankle-brachial index, and other lab tests
- History of preeclampsia or early menopause
- Increasing age
- Male gender
- Metabolic syndrome
People between the ages of 40 and 75 who haven’t had a heart attack should ask their doctor to assess their 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event, the AHA recommends. CAC testing may then help physicians develop treatment plans for patients at intermediate risk.
Dr. Luke Laffin, a preventive cardiologist at Cleveland Clinic, suggests speaking to your primary care physician about your risk factors and whether a CAC test may be appropriate—even if you’re on the younger side like Ohanian, 40.
“It’s a field in flux, and I think most preventive cardiologists are moving toward being a little bit more aggressive with coronary calcium scoring in younger, lower-risk patients,” Laffin says. “It doesn’t mean everyone should get it, but it has to be an individualized decision based on family history and other risk factors.”
While both Gerstner and Ohanian said they spent $100 on their CAC tests, the AHA notes the procedure isn’t always covered by insurance and can range from $100–$400.
Calcium score test is a tool, not a testament
A CAC test is one you want to fail; a score of 0 means you don’t have any calcified plaque in your coronary arteries, and/or you have a very low short-term risk of stroke or heart attack, Laffin says. The scans are graded on what’s called an Agatston score:
- 0: No identifiable disease
- 1–99: Mild disease
- 100–399: Moderate disease
- Over 400: Severe disease
But just as a high score isn’t a death sentence, a low score provides your doctor with only a piece of the puzzle. For example, a CAC test doesn’t show the degree of blockage or narrowing in an artery, Laffin says.
“It’s a biomarker, like blood pressure, like cholesterol,” Laffin tells Fortune. “If it’s elevated—greater than 0—it suggests that there’s already plaque within those arteries, and we should be aggressive about trying to control cardiovascular risk factors.”
Ebinger calls the CAC test “a fine-tuning mechanism.” While you’re stuck with some risk factors such as age and heredity, focus instead on what you can modify, such as getting your cholesterol under control, Ebinger says. Your doctor may recommend a statin, a type of prescription drug used to lower “bad” (LDL) cholesterol, based on your CAC test results.
In his X post, Gerstner wrote, “Well intended cholesterol charts have mis-led millions of people about heart disease. Cholesterol is NOT a predictor of heart attacks – approx 50% of heart attack patients have LDL levels in the green!” He included a cholesterol chart that notes total cholesterol under 200 is heart-healthy, which appears to have been copied from the Cleveland Clinic website. Gerstner didn’t say where he got his numbers; conversely, a 2023 AHA survey found that 75% of heart attack and stroke survivors reported having high cholesterol.
Like the CAC test, cholesterol level is just one tool to help paint a picture of your overall health and cardiovascular disease risk, Laffin says, noting that LDL cholesterol is perhaps a more valuable measure of risk at the population level.
Gerstner, 52, said on X that his concierge doctor cited his “great health” as a reason not to get a CAC test, “But I insisted bc I have had too many friends die young of heart attacks.” Gerstner scored a 77, indicating mild heart disease and spurring him into action.
“The discovery of plaque led me to 1) get a CT Angiogram / Heartflow which found below avg uncalcified plaque / limited blockage (good news) 2) take a statin / ezetimibe which has reduced my LDL to 36,” Gerstner wrote. “I am now preventing the build up of addt plaque and have a baseline to monitor and avoid problems. Living without data is NOT a strategy!”
Gainsight CEO Nick Mehta responded, “I had the exact same experience. Great cholesterol but still had blockage. On statins now.”

As they probably should! But we’ve definitely seen them get out of hand. Like when this asinine dad was mad at his 7-year-old for being “unfaithful” to her “boyfriend.” *Jaw drop*
This time, on the “Am I The A—hole? (AITA?)” subreddit, we’re met with a man who has a 16-year-old son, “J.” The man who originally posted (the “OP” in Reddit lingo) said that J’s mom took off 12 years ago. OP said he’s “done his best” as a single parent, and that J has never given him much reason to take on an “‘authoritative’ role.”
“My son has always been my best friend,” he said sweetly. “… He’s always been the kind of kid who just needed a guiding hand in the right direction. He’s smart, level-headed, and generally a very caring person.”
J’s Love Life
OP shared that his son has been dating a “nice” and “respectful” 16-year-old girl, “E,” for about two years now. A couple of weeks ago, E was over and she and J got into a “pretty heated argument,” and so E asked OP for a ride home.
“I let J know [I was taking her] and asked if he’s OK,” OP said. “He said he’s a bit frustrated, and maybe some space would be a good idea.”
When OP got home, J explained what happened. As a courtesy to his son, OP didn’t give the details, but he said it was a “common argument” for couples.
“J said he would talk to her once he had a more level head. Everything sounded reasonable.”
But right when things sound reasonable, that’s when sh*t hits the fan on Reddit.
Here Comes OP
A few days ago, J said he had a friend coming over. OP was tired from working overtime, so he went ahead and took a nap. When he woke up, he heard a woman’s voice downstairs. And no, it was not E’s voice.
“I come downstairs to J kissing an unfamiliar girl,” OP said. “I asked J if he could help me with something quickly.”
*Wink wink*
When OP got J away from Mystery Girl, he asked who she was and was told she’s “just a friend.” (What do you think, Biz Markie?!) Turns out this was all a ploy to get E to “pull her head out of her a**.” Whatever the hell that means.
Nope! Nope, nope, nope. That was not going to fly with OP. He told J that either he could tell E himself, or he would. J called his dad’s bluff, but OP quickly called E’s dad to clue him in. E subsequently broke up with J (as she probably should have!), and then J turned his anger on his dad.
Following? That’s a lot of letters, I know.
“I yelled at J to pack his stuff and that until he can learn he owes E an apology and accept responsibility, he will be staying with his aunt,” OP said. “I take his car keys, my sister picks him up and he leaves pissed.”
It’s been several days and J is still refusing to reach out. “I spoke with my friend about the situation and he told me I should have let it be,” OP said. “J knows I don’t condone cheating but maybe my buddy is right. AITA?”
Reddit’s Reaction
OK, OK, let’s just get it out of the way: Cheating is bad. But is J the “a—hole?”…meh. Reddit isn’t so convinced. J isn’t the villain — he’s the teenager.
“I think you overreacted,” said the top comment with 2.2 thousand upvotes. “At that age, your kid should never have home taken away … I totally agree with the argument, calling E’s dad, and setting some sort of punishment … What that punishment should be? I don’t know. That’s the hard part about parenting. ESH, but you most of all for forcing your kid to stay elsewhere. The punishment outweighs the crime.”
“Your teenager did a stupid. This is what teenagers do.”
“YTA You are supposed to be the adult. J is a child. Raise him. Teach him. Discuss things with him. But kicking him out? Nope … that’s not parenting.”
Many Redditors pointed out that this could have been a trauma response from OP and that perhaps there was infidelity between him and J’s mom. But that’s for OP to figure out on his own — not for him to take out on J.
“Well the kid probably has trauma too from his mother abandoning him and OP just did the same.”
“It sure is a trauma for his son. He will never be able to trust his father 100% like he did before. Every time they disagree (and he is a teen so this is a given) he is going to wonder if his father will throw him out of his house.”
“And this was the teachable moment that is now gone. Hopefully the aunt is better at this than OP.”
And on and on it went. People were begging OP to stay out of teenagers’ love lives. And Redditors were reminding each other that sending a kid to their relative’s house is (thankfully) much different from full-on kicking them out. Ultimately, they don’t have the time to pick on J and his BS. OP is the a—hole, they say. OP is the one to blame.
“You made a bad parenting call. Do better You’re the adult, he’s a teenager.”
Update
OP graciously came back to Reddit to update his post and thanked Redditors for the “reality check.”
“While my son knows my feelings about cheating, very explicitly so, telling him to leave to live with my sister was in fact a poor choice,” OP said. “I shouldn’t have reacted that way, this is his home and always will be.”
“I just got off the phone with my son and he apologized for crossing a line ‘I had drawn in the sand’ by his words,” he continued. “I apologized to him and said … I shouldn’t have made him feel like his home is something that can be taken away from him … he will always have a place to land on his feet here in our home … We had a long conversation and I think we have a better understanding of each other’s boundaries and roles now.”
OP went on to share that his son’s “friend” was not aware of E and is “giving J sh*t for using her.” He apparently apologized to E, but she’s still upset (fair!) and that their future remains unclear.
“I should have put more thought into what I was doing at the time,” OP conceded. “I still refuse to allow cheating in my home, but a home is not a possession to be taken away from a person. It’s his as much as mine and I never want him to feel like it’s off limits to him again. My sister is of course, giving us both a bit of grief in her light-hearted way.”
Well, that just might be the most productive, game-changing Reddit we’ve ever read.
AITA for throwing my son out of the house?

But beyond issues of copyright and quality, they're also causing a quandary for many young potential designers who are at the juncture where they need to decide what to train in.
Many of those interested in a career in design are wondering whether it's worth investing a significant amount of money in education if there's a chance that certain jobs may not exist by the time they complete their studies. Questions on the topic have generated some intense debate online, as seen in a recent post on the Design subreddit.
Do you think we will need graphic designers in the future ? from r/Design
The question from an undergraduate who wants to switch majors from computer science to design is typical of the concerns of many who are interested in studying design at the moment. What’s the future for those jobs, especially with ai growing so fast?"" the user asks.
The question was met with plenty of reassurance, with the majority of those responding taking the view that graphic design jobs will continue to exist. One of the arguments is that many clients simply won't know what to ask an AI image generator to create, even if AI does become good enough to deliver quality results.
""Clients have no idea what they want,"" one person argued. ""AI can't provide them with design they don't know they want."" Another person added that some clients want – or even need – an ""emotionally transactional interaction"" where they correct the work of the designer"".
Others had a more conceptual argument based on the purpose of graphic design as human-centred communication. ""You will always need a human to interpret and adjust an AI design no matter how good it is,"" one person wrote. ""What matters is the human experience and an AI can only guess as to how we will interpret something. That goes for the actual words to the visuals, which must convey emotion and speak to the human experience.""
""The job may change and morph over the years but there will always be a need. People trust people and only people can design for people, there will always need to be that human touch,"" was another contribution, while one person quipped: ""I've said this before, and I'll say it again: 'make it pop' won't yield the results clients are looking for if they try using AI.""
Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.
Others see a problem for clients in the lack of control that AI provides. ""Real design requires precise measurement and the ability to replicate, modify, etc. AI is nowhere near close to replacing graphic designers,"" one person said, while suggesting that it's a different story for digital artists. Others believe that small to medium companies driven on profit and with not much ethics will be happy to make do with AI tools but that this will also make human work more sought after.
On the other side, there are some recommending that the user stick with computer science, not because AI is going to render graphic design jobs obsolete but because the pay in an entry-level job will be better. Meanwhile, others suggest that computer science would be a very valuable addition to design on today's job market.
A veteran designer lamented not having studied computing, saying that not being unable to do much beyond the very basics with code had resulted in missed opportunities. However, others pointed out that jobs in coding are also likely to be impacted by AI. Another person predicted that the salary difference between designers and managers will become more pronounced.
Last month, we reported on a study of industry executives commissioned by a quartet of arts organisations to find out how people with power in film, TV and gaming think AI will change their human resources requirements. A quarter thought that graphic designers would be affected. Of concern for new students, most believed that across the creative sectors entry-level positions are the ones that are most vulnerable.
There's no definitive conclusion, and it's understandably a difficult time for anyone trying to decide what to study. More than ever, today's undergraduates have to approach their degree with a view that what they end up doing even a few years down the line could be very different from what they expected, but a firm theoretical basis in design concepts should be as valid then as it is now even if they tools and methods change.

Advance Publications, owned by the publicity shy Newhouse family, one of America’s richest dynasties, has a 30.1pc stake in Reddit – which is targeting a valuation of up to $6.4bn when it goes public next week.
On Monday Reddit set an initial price range of between $31 and $34 a share, which would value Advance’s stake at between $1.3bn and $1.4bn.
Condé Nast, the Advance-owned publishing empire behind Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, acquired Reddit for $10m in 2006, a year after it was founded.
Advance was launched in 1922 by the publishing magnate Sam Newhouse, who later handed control of the business to his heirs Donald and Samuel Jr before his death in 1979.
Samuel Jr, who died in 2017, was credited with developing the family’s iconic titles, while 94-year-old Donald remains president of Advance.
Donald and Samuel Jr built up a Succession-worthy collection of newspaper, magazine and telecommunications assets that remain owned by the family, which continues to keep a low profile.
Control has gradually been handed over to the brothers’ sons, Steven, Michael and Samuel III, as well as younger cousin, Jonathan. The family is listed as America’s 13th-richest with a combined wealth of $24.1bn, according to Forbes.
As well as Reddit and Condé Nast, the group owns the Ironman long-distance race group and is the largest shareholder in Warner Bros Discover and telecoms giant Charter.

SEO experts warn bad actors are gaming an algorithm change that prioritises first party data on forums.
Reddit’s remarkable rise up Google’s search rankings has left search marketing experts flabbergasted and concerned.
Data shared with B&T reveals that In the past six months, since Google changed its algorithm in a Helpful Content Update, Reddit’s traffic across the internet has nearly increased fourfold, often at the expense of smaller independent publishers.
Reddit’s surge in search traffic coincides with the platform listing on the New York Stock Exchange later this month. The social media platform is eyeing a valuation of as much $US6.5 billion ($9.8 billion) in an initial public offering.
In August 2023, Reddit notched up traffic of 160 million, which increased to 480 million in February this year. The rise in Australia tells a similar story, according to two data sets shared with B&T (see Ahrefs data below).
It’s a similar case for Quora, whose global organic search traffic increased from around 75m in September to 250m in March.
On the flip side, the organic traffic for smaller publishers has fallen off a cliff since the Helpful Content Update in September.
An article by the product review site HouseFresh, complains about it being outranked on Google, ironically appears much higher up in search on a Reddit thread than the original article.
Ahref data shared that tracks organic search paints a bleak picture for the websites Truly Experiences, K9 of Mine and The Adventure Lab.

Search Engine Optimisation experts have questioned why Google is pushing the search results of Reddit and Quora so heavily.
Peter Mead, the Head of SEO at Bring Performance, explained that Google recently struck a $60m deal that provides it access to Reddit content to train Google’s AI models.
Mead questions whether the deal could be influencing Google’s search results.
“Google now has real time access for Google to data about massive troves of content on Reddit’s platform,” Mead said. “Google will argue that no deal influences its search but it’s obvious Reddit is benefitting from it.
“In this industry where we are working with Google all the time, publishers want to see a fair and a level playing field. The question is has Google overstepped that mark.”
A haven for spam?
Carl Forrester, the SEO Manager at performance agency Calibre9, told B&T that the rise in search visibility on Reddit has led to heavy amounts of spam on Reddit forums.
“They are rewarding first-party websites like Reddit and it appears they’ve gone extremely far with that. A lot of the search results we are now seeing include out of date reddit threads and quite inaccurate information,” Forrester said.
“We are already seeing people taking advantage of Reddit’s increased visibility and posting things like affiliate links, decreasing the quality of the threads. Reddit previously faced a blackout from moderators over charging for access to the API (Application Programming Interface).
“There could be further issues if the volume of spam increases as a result of the deal with Google.”
Calibre9 founder and SEO strategist Josh Thomson warned: “The quality of search results have crashed across all news articles. What we want to see is Google developing the most relevant content to a search query rather than search results form Reddit that are old, non-relevant and not insightful.”
Google declined to comment on the Reddit traffic surge specifically, but in a previous tweet said it was “independent of the Reddit partnership” and reflects a move by the search engine to favour “first-hand perspectives across all types of sites in our search results, including hundreds of forum sites”.
Last week, Google revealed that it is working on changes to its algorithm to tackle Gen AI-produced spam to improve its search. Google claims the change will reduce “low-quality, unoriginal content” in search results by 40 percent.

Here's why electric cars might make you more carsick than conventional vehicles – and some strategies you can use to fix it.
With it beginning to look like an electric-only future, you might soon find yourself in an electric vehicle, wondering why you're feeling much more carsick than when riding in an internal combustion car (ICE).
It's slowly become one of the most popular questions on Reddit in the EV and Tesla threads: ""Why do electric cars make me feel sick?"". One user even said they questioned buying a Tesla Model Y because of it.
""I'm thinking of buying a Model Y as it seems like the ideal electric family car, but I did a test drive yesterday and felt moderately motion sick afterwards,"" wrote one Reddit user.
Another user said: ""I drive in an electric vehicle a lot, and I've found that regenerative braking absolutely makes me motion sick. I'm not always driving, so I don't always have control of how it's being driven, so other people's driving really makes me sick… I really need to find a solution fast"".
Some drivers also reported their electric cars making their pets sick too.
""Since [buying] the Tesla, [my dog] throws up in it almost every time. Already messing up my carpets but such is life. It is city driving, but again not new to her. I've been trying to drive smoothly but still doesn't seem to help,"" one Reddit user said.
The reality is our bodies react differently to the forces in an electric car than to those we feel in an ICE vehicle, with EVs often confusing the brain based on what we're seeing, hearing and feeling.
There are several factors at play; we have some home remedies you can try, plus a look at what car manufacturers are doing to combat this carsickness.
Why do I feel sick in an electric car?
Being behind the wheel in an electric car will likely save you from suffering motion sickness because you're in control of the vehicle and know what's coming next.
A study titled Knowing what's coming: Anticipatory audio cues can mitigate motion sickness explained why drivers often don't feel the same motion sickness as their passengers.
""Being able to anticipate upcoming motion is known to potentially mitigate sickness resulting from provocative motion,"" the 2020 study from Vrije University in the Netherlands stated.
The research also provided insight into why electric cars may make you motion sick, and it actually comes down to their lack of sound.
""Average illness ratings were significantly lower for the condition that contained informative auditory cues, as compared to the condition without informative cues. This knowledge, i.e. that auditory signals can improve anticipation of motion, could be of importance in reducing carsickness in domains such as that of autonomous vehicles,"" the paper found.
A key factor that needs to be considered is the lack of engine noise in EVs. Our bodies are accustomed to riding in internal combustion vehicles, so the lack of noise and vibration in an EV can actually throw your balance off.
Another of the main contributors to carsickness in an EV is something called regenerative braking – a system in electric cars that generates force through the resistance while off the throttle to help charge the battery and add some extra range. This regenerative braking can often feel more aggressive and happen more frequently than conventional braking, particularly in stop-start traffic.
EVs also have a lot more torque and a more linear acceleration compared to their internal combustion counterparts. This means that those who aren't used to the immediate power and heavy acceleration associated with electric cars will often anticipate a lot less acceleration than usual, causing the body to get confused.
Another small factor that needs to be pointed out is the growing size of built-in screens in modern vehicles – not just electric cars.
Many passengers can be caught out by staring at the computer-sized head units that cover half the dash in models from the likes of Tesla or Polestar. Taking your eyes off the road and focusing on a large screen can throw your balance off, although it's hard not to stare at it when it's right there in front of you.
How to prevent carsickness in an EV
Most of the major brands like Tesla, BYD and MG all have adjustable regenerative braking options across a lot of their range. Lowering the regenerative braking in your car will give you a much smoother ride, but it'll come at the cost of losing some range.
Being smoother on the throttle will also help combat some of that motion sickness. As tempting as it is to jam the throttle off every set of lights to unleash that immediate torque, doing this is a surefire way to cause a mess for your passengers.
Manufacturers like Honda are looking to squash carsickness by revising their power mapping for a smoother ride at low speeds. Honda is on the case with its e:Ny1 (which is not available in Australia at this time) by changing their throttle map to emulate an acceleration similar to an ICE vehicle.
Adding that feeling of throttle lag that you get from internal combustion vehicles will help ease discomfort for those who aren't used to the immediate torque of an EV, likely at the cost of some performance.
Other brands, like Hyundai with the Ioniq 5 N, are adding fake engine sounds that are linked to the pedal on their EVs and even adding fake flappy paddles that mimic gear changes. While this is just a bit of fun for the owners, it could actually help combat some of the motion sickness felt in an EV.
How to fix motion sickness
Lucky for you, carsickness isn't a new thing. You can pick up a packet of TravaCalm or Kwell motion sickness tablets at your local pharmacy for under $10. These are a must-have in the glovebox to combat carsickness.
You can also pick up a pair of anti-motion sickness glasses online. These work by creating an artificial horizon in your peripheral vision to help stabilise your balance. These aren't clinically proven, but they're a low-risk option to try out that cost around $13 on Amazon.
If you don't want to take medication or try new gadgets, the easiest way to combat motion sickness is to look forward and not sit on your phone while in the car. Cracking the window for some fresh air and staying hydrated on long journeys also help.",https://www.drive.com.au/caradvice/motion-sickness-electric-cars/

Northern California’s most infamous unfinished mansion — according to Reddit, at least — has finally listed for sale.
For nearly half a century, owner Bruce Remington has been building — using “medieval hand methods” — a Newport, Rhode Island-inspired French-ornamental gothic cathedral on 4.59 acres of redwood forest just outside the city of Eureka.
And if you look up 832 Westgate Drive on Reddit, be prepared to go down one of the site’s weirdest rabbit holes.
The mysterious eight-bedroom, three-bathroom, 13,000-square-foot property was recently listed for sale by the owner himself on Zillow for $4.5 million. Despite being the most expensive house in Humboldt County, Remington doesn’t think that seven-figure sum does his project justice.
Remington told The Post it will be worth two to three times that “when cleaned-up, organized better and finished further.” Still, Zillow’s Zestimate is only $890,100 and reads, “The list price and Zestimate for this home are very different, so we might be missing something.”
While some pictures clearly show the mansion through the years, many of the 119 photos on Zillow are rather unusual to see. It seems that Remington, a New York native and Cornell University graduate, also included photos from his vision board, and not the final product.
For example, a listing photo of a single upholstered chair appears to come from Wayfair. It also appears he’s sprinkled in some personal photos from a trip, his or someone else’s to Château de Fontainebleau in France, and maybe even done some Photoshop to finish a wall, or two.
While The Post hasn’t been able to find a local agent who is familiar with the unique property — it boasts gargoyles, finials and wall buttresses — Remington insists a broker who passed away in 2008 once said the home had a million-dollar ocean view.
“I agree and would place at least a $500,000 value on that alone,” Remington said. Still, he confesses that it’s contingent upon the surrounding forest. “The ocean view lasts about 3-5 years. Today very little ocean view is visible, under 1% probably, but it will be closer to 75-92% of maximum after this season’s logging.”
What’s not conditional, however, is the impressive collection of furniture that comes with the residence.
Among its treasures are nearly a dozen antique tables, “various rare cabinets,” two antique chandeliers, 1,500 square feet of “palatial antique Italian marquetry” and a solid gold-plated grandfather clock.
Remington reckons the furnishings alone are worth $600,000. Then, there’s the “miscellaneous valuable artwork from the last 150 years” that also comes with it. He estimates the mansion’s myriad works of art to be worth more than $50,000.
The property also boasts three antique fireplaces, including a 600-pound marble masterpiece that Remington estimates to be worth $70,000, and gold-leafed ceilings reminiscent of Versailles. Meanwhile, the antique paneling downstairs gets its inspiration from Florida’s famous Stetson Mansion.
Remington, a master craftsman, when it comes to wood at least, made his fortune dealing in burl. According to a brief bio he posted on Reddit, “He sold vast quantities from 1970-2012 under business names: Burl Tree (Broadway, Eureka); Creative designs; Westgate doors and Paul Bunyan stores, all closed now with Remington long-since retired.”
For the last 43 years, 832 Westgate Drive has been his passion project. Literally.
“I never lived, ate and watched much TV in it, but did have major offices there for 30 years, have spent 100 nights there in the bedroom and have entertained women there for three to six hours perhaps 1,000 times,” he said.
He’s selling the property because his interests have “radically shifted” from spending seven nights a week chasing, entertaining and romancing women in the house. Currently, he lives just a few minutes away with his ex-wife, Sue, in another million-dollar home.
Of course, the biggest priority is to sell the house. But buyer beware, it’s still a work-in-progress.
“There’s no hot water. No proper kitchen, and the place is very odd,” wrote one Redditor who claims to have worked on the house and described it as a “kinder clutter hoarder paradise.”
Still, the Redditor admits that it has “good bones.”",https://nypost.com/2024/03/11/real-estate/unfinished-california-mansion-lists-for-4-5m/

Reddit disclosed further details of what is set to be one of 2024’s biggest initial public offerings (IPO), with the company and some shareholders seeking to raise as much as US$748 million (S$995 million).
Reddit and the holders are planning to sell 22 million shares for US$31 to US$34 each, the social media platform said in a filing on March 11. About 15.3 million of those shares will be sold by the company and the rest by the investors, who are Reddit employees.
At the top of that range, Reddit, whose users helped create the meme stock frenzy of 2021, would have a market value of US$5.4 billion, based on almost 159 million shares outstanding. Fully diluted to include employee stock options and restricted share units, the company’s valuation would be about US$6.4 billion, the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission shows.
About 8 per cent of the IPO shares are being set aside for Reddit users and moderators who created accounts before Jan 1, as well as some board members and friends and family of some employees and directors. Those shares will not be subject to a lock-up, meaning the owners can sell them on the opening day of trading, according to Reddit’s filing that confirms an earlier report by Bloomberg News.
The IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America, according to Reddit’s filings. Reddit plans for its shares to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol RDDT.
The company intends to price the IPO on March 20 and begin trading the following day, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the information was not public. A representative for Reddit did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the timing.
Reddit’s valuation
Reddit’s more than two-year slog to listing reflects the ups and downs of the market, beginning with its initial confidential filing in 2021, when IPOs on US exchanges set an all-time record of US$339 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Reddit raised funds that year, valuing it at US$10 billion, and Bloomberg News reported the following year that it could be valued at as much as US$15 billion in an IPO.
Meanwhile, IPOs in the US tumbled, reaching only US$26 billion in 2023, the data showed. In January, Bloomberg News reported that Reddit was weighing feedback from early meetings with potential IPO investors that it should consider a valuation of at least US$5 billion.
The company is a high-profile addition to the year’s roster of newly and soon-to-be public companies. The biggest of those listings was the US$1.57 billion offering by Amer Sports in January. Astera Labs, a software maker focused on artificial intelligence (AI), said in a filing on March 8 that it would seek up to US$534 million in its IPO, which will likely proceed after Reddit’s.
Reddit’s listing will be watched closely by IPO candidates such as Microsoft-backed data security start-up Rubrik and healthcare payments company Waystar Technologies. Their deliberations come after a quartet of US listings led by semiconductor designer Arm Holdings’ US$5.23 billion offering in September failed to ignite a lasting rebound in the market.
Shrinking losses
Founded in 2005, Reddit averaged 73.1 million daily active unique visitors in the fourth quarter, according to its filings. The company reported a net loss of US$91 million on revenue of US$804 million in 2023, compared with a net loss of about US$159 million on revenue of US$667 million a year earlier.
Reddit’s largest shareholder is Advance Magazine Publishers, part of the Newhouse family publishing empire that owns Conde Nast, which bought Reddit in 2006 and spun it out in 2011.
Reddit said its millions of loyal users and moderators pose risks as well as a benefit for the company. Redditors have a historically combative relationship with the site, launching revolts over everything from racism on the platform to executives’ staffing decisions.
Meme stocks
Thousands of members of the WallStreetBets forum – which boasts around 15 million users and helped popularise meme stocks like GameStop – voted to boost a forum post about shorting Reddit’s stock when it begins trading. Their reasons varied from the company’s lack of profitability to competitive concerns.
Some of the largely anonymous users on Reddit expressed an interest in buying IPO shares, while others called the IPO a “mistake” or predicted that the stock will crash.
“Honestly don’t believe it will be successful,” one user wrote. “Too many social media companies chasing a few dollars. They already throw all the ads at me and I will not pay them to disable it. I never clicked on an ad on purpose.”
Reddit co-founder and chief executive Steven Huffman said in a signed letter included in the filings that the company has many opportunities to grow both the platform and the business.
“Advertising is our first business, and advertisers of all sizes have discovered that Reddit is a great place to find high-intent customers that they aren’t able to reach elsewhere,” Mr Huffman said. “Advertising on Reddit is rapidly evolving, and we are still in the early phases of growing this business.”
AI licensing
Reddit said it is in the early stages of allowing third parties to license access to data on the platform, including to train AI models. The company said that in January, it entered into data licensing arrangements with an aggregate contract value of US$203 million and terms ranging from two to three years. It expects a minimum of US$66.4 million of revenue from those agreements in 2024, according to the filings.
Reddit has also announced a deal with Alphabet’s Google, allowing Google’s AI products to use Reddit data to improve their technology. Large language models often need vast troves of human-generated content to improve.
Mr Huffman owns shares that will give him 3.3 per cent of the voting power after the offering. That includes Class B shares that will have 10 votes each compared with one each for the Class A shares to be sold in the IPO, the filings show. He also has a voting proxy agreement with Advance.
Other large shareholders include chief operating officer Jennifer Wong, as well as FMR and entities affiliated with OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman, Tencent Holdings, Vy Capital, Quiet Capital and Tacit Capital, according to the filings.
In all, Mr Huffman and those investors will hold about three-quarters of the shareholder voting rights after the IPO.
Mr Huffman’s fellow co-founder, venture capitalist Alexis Ohanian, is not listed among the investors with stakes of 5 per cent or more and is not named elsewhere in the filings. BLOOMBERG",https://www.straitstimes.com/business/reddit-launches-long-awaited-ipo-with-995m-target

The Biden administration describes domestic terrorism and ""the most urgent terrorism threat facing the United States.""
A newly published US Government Accountability Report (GAO) looks at the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security in combating domestic violent extremism online, and in the process reveals what we surely all knew anyway. Discord? Reddit? Roblox. All your base are belong to the Feds!
The GAO report (first picked up by The Intercept) is more wide-ranging than just gaming, but is essentially focused on online communication platforms of all sorts, how US government and law enforcement agencies interact with them, and what the companies themselves are and should be doing about extreme content. The report is based on interviews with five companies that have been coordinating with the FBI and DHS: Roblox, Discord, Reddit, plus one gaming publisher and one social media company that asked to remain anonymous. Insert your guesses here.
The nature of this cooperation when it comes to the gaming companies is essentially that the DHS holds meetings at which they share information ""about online activities promoting domestic violent extremism"" or even stuff that violates their terms of service. The companies provide leads on anything that may potentially be illegal and the FBI follows up. In addition to this Discord and Roblox have a ""trusted flagger"" program through which ""approved subject matter experts in extremism can use a streamlined channel to report potentially violating content.""
We'll get into the weeds of what the government thinks such content may include, but the report offers some examples. ""Researchers have identified user-generated re-creations of mass shootings on the gaming platform Roblox, such as the 2019 shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the 2022 shooting in Buffalo, New York. Roblox officials told us their moderation team reviewed their content moderation tools and adjusted them to block these games and prevent content glorifying violent incidents from appearing on the platform.""
Recreations of real world mass shootings (and on a platform with a huge young audience) are one thing, but what may worry some is how vague and potentially over-reaching the US government is about what may constitute domestic violent extremism. Since 2019 it has defined five types of domestic terrorism threat: racially motivated extremism, anti-government and anti-authority extremism, animal rights and environmental extremism, abortion-related extremism, then the catch-all of any other domestic terror threats.
These categories are so broad that people may rightly wonder where the line is between responsible intervention (such as with the Roblox examples) and the potential for Big Brother overreach when someone is having a normal one online about how much they hate the government or the repeal of Roe vs. Wade. To give the report its due, it does acknowledge the big unanswered questions about the friction between the above and Americans' free speech rights, but it's not like the FBI is known for its nuanced approach towards potential extremists: in recent decades it's been behind some shocking lapses and botched schemes, and been accused of entrapment of suspects multiple times.
Nevertheless, this is not going away: the GAO was asked to investigate domestic violent extremists' use of games, gaming-related platforms and social media by the House Homeland Security Committee, and it follows Congressional pressure being applied to various major gaming publishers early last year.
Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.
This all arguably stems from the storming of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, by supporters of former President Donald Trump, an event which saw the then-incoming Biden administration swiftly designate domestic terrorism as ""the most urgent terrorism threat facing the United States"" once in office and create the first nation-wide strategy for combating it. In this strategy the US government specifically cites ""online gaming platforms"" as the kind of places where ""recruiting and mobilizing individuals to domestic terrorism occurs.""
This report was commissioned in order to make recommendations and, generally speaking, it spells-out what US authorities are currently doing and what they should be doing in the future. It ends by saying both the FBI and the DHS's Intelligence and Analysis division should develop their own ""strategy and goals for sharing information related to domestic violent extremism with social media and gaming companies.""
In civilian speak, that means by this summer both agencies will be issuing their own forward-looking plans for coordinating with gaming and gaming related platforms, and basically telling the publishers what they want to see. Meantime? Enjoy Roblox. Just maybe save the venting about Climate Change for Disc… oh.

Mia Mosley made the order with popular delivery service DoorDash on March 6, and after receiving her order, she was shocked to get a message from the driver.
The message read, ""Hello! It's my birthday today! If you'd like to add a special touch, you can leave a tip for your Dash driver on Cash App,"" followed by the driver's payment details.
""I was honestly surprised by how bold someone could be to ask for more money on top of a tip. I just found it extremely unprofessional and ungrateful of what I already gave her,"" Mosley told Newsweek.
A DoorDash spokesperson told Newsweek: ""Tipping on our platform is always optional, and Dashers keep 100 percent of the tips they receive. There is not currently a policy in place that prohibits Dashers from discussing tips.""
After receiving the message, Mosley decided to share it on Reddit's popular r/DoorDash subreddit, asking others if they felt the request was unprofessional.
The post prompted replies where people were unimpressed with the Dasher's actions.
""Report. Immediately report any tip beggars in any way,"" wrote one commenter.
""The tip begging thing is getting ridiculous,"" agreed another Reddit user.
This is far from the first time the subject of tips has prompted debate, as more people begin to criticize American tipping culture that sees many service workers on low wages and relying on tips.
A 2023 survey suggested that younger generations are turning away from tipping. The Bankrate survey found that only 35 percent of Gen Zers say they always tip at sit-down restaurants, compared to 83 percent of baby boomers.
When it comes to food delivery services, like DoorDash, only 31 percent of Gen Zers said that they will always tip.
This sparks frustration from many in service industries that automatically have a lower minimum wage. This is because the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) only requires businesses to pay tipped employees $2.13 an hour, as long as their combined wages and tip income reach the federal minimum wage of $7.25.
Despite a background of tipping debate, Reddit users remained unswayed. Another reply on the post read: ""Sorry but I would just ignore it. Or if I'm feeling petty, I'd report it. unprofessional, tbh [to be honest].""
Some even suggested a different course of action: ""If anyone sends you their CashApp like this, instead of sending them money I like to request money from them instead,"" wrote one commenter.
""I shared it on Reddit because I needed some type of clarification that it was inappropriate and I wasn't just being negative,"" said Mosley.

Coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam, Dragon's Dogma 2 takes place in a parallel universe which ""mirrors the world setting of the original game"". Players can explore the human kingdom of Vermund and the beastren kingdom of Battahl and ultimately take on a big evil dragon.
The myriard non-player characters of Dragon's Dogma 2 also appear endlessly complex, as beyond some pawns being completely customisable as mentioned above, NPCs can form different bonds with the player character and may even fight each other for the player's love.

Apple Vision Pro unlocks new opportunities for health app developers
Breakthrough health and wellness apps are designed to take advantage of the infinite canvas in visionOS, unveiling spatial experiences that benefit users in clinical settings and at home
For decades, medical institutions and developers have taken advantage of Apple’s innovative products and frameworks to help achieve better patient outcomes, increase cost savings, broaden research opportunities, and improve efficiency. From using iPad to lower the cost and shorten the length of NICU stays so newborns can be at home with their families, to iPhone helping nurses respond faster to alerts and alarms and improve medication administration, the healthcare community has driven purposeful change with powerful Apple products at their fingertips.
Now, with the introduction of Apple Vision Pro, developers have unparalleled opportunities to deliver experiences that can positively impact people’s lives, whether they’re at home or at a clinic. Vision Pro seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world, unlocking powerful spatial experiences in an infinite canvas. And with the unique capabilities of visionOS, healthcare developers are creating new apps that were not previously possible, transforming areas such as clinical education, surgical planning, training, medical imaging, behavioral health, and more.
“We’re thrilled to see the incredible apps that developers across the healthcare community are bringing to Apple Vision Pro,” said Susan Prescott, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. “The imagination and drive of our developers, combined with the technical capabilities of visionOS, are igniting new possibilities for physicians, frontline workers, and even students, and we can’t wait to see what’s to come.”
Here are just a few of the apps currently available on Apple Vision Pro in the healthcare and wellness space.
Surgical Planning and Education
More than 1 million Americans receive a knee or hip replacement surgery every year, and that number will continue to rise as the population ages.1 When surgeons use Stryker’s Mako SmartRobotics for total hip, total knee, and partial knee replacements, it can help lead to better patient outcomes like less pain and shorter recovery times, compared to traditional joint replacement surgeries. With the new myMako app, Stryker is extending a surgeon’s experience in and beyond the operating room with Apple Vision Pro and iPhone. For better preparation, myMako allows surgeons to visualize and review patients’ Mako surgical plans at any time in a brilliant, immersive visual experience.
“The myMako app for Apple Vision Pro allows surgeons the ability to access intricate surgical plan details and insights at their fingertips in a 3D-native, intuitive, and dynamic way. This level of insight — anytime, anywhere — was previously not possible,” said Robert Cohen, Stryker’s president of Digital, Robotics, and Enabling Technologies. “With Apple Vision Pro, Stryker’s market-leading enabling technologies such as Mako SmartRobotics have the exciting potential to transform the way surgeons think about preoperative planning and the intraoperative experience, all consistent with Stryker’s mission to make healthcare better.”
To alleviate some of the timely challenges healthcare workers face in onboarding and training, Boston Children’s Hospital developed a comprehensive learning experience in a safe, universally accessible virtual environment. Created for Apple Vision Pro, CyranoHealth places a spotlight on skills related to new medical equipment, like medical infusion pumps, helping improve confidence and reduce anxiety for frontline workers, beginning with nurses. This immersive, multisensory approach allows students to familiarize themselves with the latest advancements in healthcare technology, helping to prepare them to navigate real-world challenges.
“CyranoHealth utilizes spatial computing to revolutionize the training of healthcare professionals, offering immersive, lifelike simulations to enhance learning and combat burnout. The app represents a significant leap forward in healthcare training, blending technology and medicine to create a future-ready workforce,” said John Brownstein, Ph.D., Boston Children’s chief innovation officer.
Additional apps in surgical planning and education include:
- Fundamental Surgery, which delivers surgical training through spatial computing for Apple Vision Pro.
- CollaboratOR 3D by KARL STORZ, which enhances surgical learning opportunities while allowing teams to scale their training efforts.
- Elsevier’s Complete HeartX, designed exclusively for Apple Vision Pro, which provides a captivating experience as it delves into the intricacies of the human body to create a realistic and engaging learning environment.
- Insight Heart, which lets users understand the human heart like never before. With ARKit, users can easily scan their physical surroundings and visualize 3D hearts using CT data, as well as explore various heart conditions.
“At Apple, we believe technology can play an important role in the evolution of healthcare,” said Sumbul Desai, MD, Apple’s vice president of Health. “With the ability to transform a user’s space, display 3D objects at life size, and see all relevant data in one view, the opportunities for health developers to use Apple Vision Pro to help improve procedural planning, education, and outcomes are limitless.”
Productivity and Collaboration
Siemens Healthineers’ Cinematic Reality app on Apple Vision Pro allows surgeons, medical students, and patients to view immersive, interactive holograms of the human body captured through medical scans in their real-world environment. Using Metal and the power of the M2 processor, the app integrates advanced path-tracing technology, simulating light interactions with virtual objects to deliver breathtakingly realistic lighting and reflections.
“Cinematic Reality gives people the opportunity to immerse themselves in a world of photorealistic renderings of the human anatomy,” said Christian Zapf, Siemens Healthineers’ head of Digital & Automation. “Apple Vision Pro perfectly presents that three-dimensional experience, combined with great flexibility and standalone use. We see great potential for the technology for clinical as well as educational purposes.”
Medical records are core to any clinician’s work with a patient, whether it’s understanding their health history or finding new opportunities to support improved health outcomes. Epic Systems, an electronic health records company, is introducing its Epic Spatial Computing Concept for Apple Vision Pro to allow physicians and clinicians to easily complete charting, review labs, communicate using secure chat, and complete In Basket workflows through intuitive gestures, like simply tapping their fingers to select, flicking their wrist to scroll, or using a virtual keyboard or dictation to type.
“Creating the first electronic health record experience for spatial computing was an exciting project for our developers,” said Seth Howard, Epic’s senior vice president of Research & Development. “With Apple Vision Pro, clinicians will be able to interact with their patients’ health information in new, immersive ways. We welcome ideas from the physician community about how this technology can expand the future of healthcare delivery.”
Additional apps in productivity and collaboration include:
- Visage Ease VP, which supports immersive spatial experiences for diagnostic imaging and multimedia. UC San Diego Health became the first health system to pilot the technology with the goal of improving patient care, looking at opportunities like potentially helping inefficient tumor board reviews and creating collaborative spaces in healthcare.
- Falcon Vue, which unleashes the power of spatial medical imaging viewing across all modalities.
- Medivis, which brings SurgicalAR Vision to Apple Vision Pro, enhancing medical imaging to support surgical precision and patient care.
Behavioral Health and Wellness
Cedars-Sinai’s Xaia app takes full advantage of the unique capabilities of Apple Vision Pro to support patients’ mental health needs. Through its trained digital avatar, Xaia offers patients AI-enabled, conversational mental health support in relaxing spatial environments where they can also do deep breathing exercises and meditation. The immersive therapy sessions take place in environments that are most comfortable to users — whether they choose to remain in their own space, or transform their environment into a relaxing location like a beach. Privacy remains core to the app; it requires no personal information or health information.
“Apple Vision Pro’s stunning display offers a gateway into a world of immersive, interactive behavioral health support — a quantum leap beyond previous technologies,” said Brennan Spiegel, MD, MSHS, professor of medicine, director of Health Services Research, and director of the master’s degree program in Health Delivery Science at Cedars-Sinai. “With Xaia, we leverage every pixel of that remarkable resolution and the full spectrum of vivid colors to craft a form of immersive therapy that’s engaging and deeply personal.

But what about consumers who can’t splurge on a $1,000 iPhone 15 Pro? And what about the electronic waste that would accrue if people threw away functional phones?
Long before there were titanium phones with bionic chips, Marcelo Claure, then head of the telecom firm Brightstar, saw an opportunity. A few years after the iPhone’s launch, he reached out to Steve Jobs to convince him to take a big strategic risk: Build a system for refurbishing and reselling Apple’s own smartphones, and salvage recyclable materials to cut costs for commodities and parts for those that don’t make the cut.
I found that story fascinating. We tend to think about very large companies as having a lot of inertia.
Claure argued that building a secondhand market for iPhones would enable Apple to not only tap a new market—people who can’t afford the latest iPhone model—but also lower its manufacturing costs. Claure, who’s also the former CEO of Sprint and Softbank, reflected on that conversation to an audience at a Harvard Business School event last year.
“I found that story fascinating. We tend to think about very large companies as having a lot of inertia,” says Professor George Serafeim, who co-led the event. “But here, a very large company that everybody respects for innovation and design and its ability to bring real solutions to the needs of consumers found a way to create a circular economy with its products over time. And not only to expand this market as a cost center, but also make it a profit center.”
Serafeim recently authored a case study that explores how Apple created its own replacement market with the start of its trade-in program in 2013, and bested rivals in the secondary market it expanded. While new phone shipments still outstrip used phones, used shipments across the mobile phone industry rose 12 percent in 2022, according to International Data Corp., as new phones shipments dropped by 11 percent. And the market is forecast to grow by 10 percent a year through 2026.
The benefits of a ‘circular economy’
Many executives might have balked at the idea of creating a used alternative that might cannibalize a flagship product. After all, iPhones account for more than half of Apple’s sales.
However, this “circular economy” model has done the opposite by helping Apple use refurbished iPhones to reach customers in markets that tend to be dominated by lower-priced competitors, the case says. With each customer, Apple gains an opportunity to add subscribers to its music, news, and gaming services.
“Refurbished iPhones are increasingly going to lower-GDP per-capita regions that might not be able to afford a $1,200 iPhone, but they would be willing to buy a $600 iPhone,” says Serafeim, the Charles M. Williams Professor of Business Administration. “Then you also have a software-as-a-service, revenue-generating model because of Apple services, where many of those people are becoming subscribers. And as a result, you have another monetization strategy.”
You don’t need Apple’s unique advantages—but they help
To be clear, Apple’s distinctive innovations helped lay the groundwork for its circular economy success. Specifically:
A well-known brand that holds value. The Apple name gives its products higher “residual value,” making them easier to resell, Serafeim says.
An actively managed operating system. Apple updates the system its devices rely on often, helping the products stay relevant. “That’s really, really critical,” he says. “If Apple didn’t provide software updates for their older phones, then the phones lose value over time.”
Durable hardware. An iPhone is hard to break. The company has spent years making iPhone cases tougher, more water resistant, and easier to repair.
High-end recyclable components. iPhones are made with expensive “rare earth” metals that can be expensive to acquire the first time around.
Designing for environmental impact
Any circular economy relies on products designed with recycling and reusability in mind. That means that the product can be easily disassembled, and the recycled material must cost less than newly made components, Serafeim says.
“In the case of Apple, they have these robots named Dave and Daisy that disassemble phones,” Serafeim says. “That allows them to decrease the costs.”
Apple also worked closely with partner companies. From one metric ton of iPhone logic boards and flexible electronic and camera modules, Apple’s partners extracted gold and copper equal to raw material mined from more than 2,000 metric tons of rock, the case study notes.
What footwear companies such as Nike are trying to do, they're trying to design products through ‘first principles’ to be fit for the purpose for disassembly and recycling.
Ideally, the company should be able to trace where the materials came from and how they were processed, so they can be transparent to consumers, who will see the environmental impact of their purchase.
“Customers want recycled materials to go into the product, but they need some kind of answer to, ‘How do I know that is recycled material?’” Serafeim says.
Apple isn’t the only company trying to create more circular economy models. Serafeim points to Nike’s efforts designing new shoes that can be disassembled and recycled easily. IKEA is taking a similar approach to furniture. And batteries for electric vehicles have similar potential because of components such as lithium and rare-earth materials that can be expensive to mine, Serafeim says.
“What footwear companies such as Nike are trying to do, they're trying to design products through ‘first principles’ to be fit for the purpose for disassembly and recycling,” Serafeim says. “That makes a big difference. Because, if you don't do that, then it just becomes so hard. And it means cost. And once you have a high cost to recycle, then you're just not going to do it.”
What it takes to build a circular economy
Serafeim advises companies to think of the circular economy through different models: reuse/resell, recycle, and repair/maintenance. Then leaders can evaluate models based on what makes sense for the product, industry, and business strategy.
“Even if you're a small company, there might be some really significant opportunities either on the revenue-generating side or on the cost-mitigation side or risk-mitigation side that you could explore,” Serafeim says.
To guide their decision-making, leaders might consider asking themselves:
Will this model improve the customer experience? “What are the basic service or product characteristics that you're providing that might make certain products better? What are the options for a circular model?” Serafeim says.
Are your raw material costs likely to change? “Just take the example of plastic. If oil prices are really high, virgin plastic is really expensive. But if oil prices are really low, virgin plastic can be very cheap,” Serafeim says. “So, in an environment where oil prices are high, like the one that we have been living in the last few years, recycled materials may make a lot of sense.”
Could generative AI help identify opportunities? Artificial intelligence tools, like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, can serve as a “co-pilot for designing a different solution or identifying opportunities by better understanding and breaking down the needs that your customers might have,” Serafeim says. “In many ways, generative AI can be really transformational because it helps you break down status-quo thinking.”
Which products stand to benefit most? “You might have some products with higher residual value and some production with lower residual value,” Serafeim says. “You might have some products where use of recycled materials might be more cost competitive, and others that might be less cost competitive.”
In some cases, none of these models will apply. Some products don’t recycle or refurbish well—yet. Those include low-quality textiles, Serafeim notes.
“Especially for low-cost and fast-fashion types of textiles,” Serafeim says. “There's very low residual value to the product. You find enormous amounts of textiles that are basically in landfills because there's no residual value. So, it’s not worth it for reuse and you cannot cover the cost of recycling.”
Transparency is key for circular shifts
Ultimately, companies and policymakers can help expand the circular economy faster by setting disclosure rules and practices, Serafeim says. For example, in China, regulations require manufacturers to take back electric-vehicle batteries.
Transparency creates accountability.
A uniform set of rules serves customers, companies, and ultimately the planet, Serafeim says. Allowing regulators, companies, and consumers to trace material sources with ease can create trust, an invaluable competitive edge for any firm.
“Transparency creates accountability,” Serafeim says. “And you cannot have accountability without transparency.”

Play the Godzilla Minus One album. Music on, I open my MacBook and connect to the Vision Pro and float into work as the movie I was watching flips into the background.
I used to think of the Apple Vision Pro as a device of the future; now, it's just a thing that's part of my life. Demystified after using it for a month, a new device normalized in my home.
After years of experience with AR and VR, I can see where an advanced device like the Vision Pro can evolve, what it can be. But those aren't all there yet when I'm using the Vison Pro right now as an everyday device. I'm using it in ways that feel very clear, delineated and limited. Even more interestingly, its uses don't really overlap much with the Meta Quest 3.
For all my dreams of a mixed reality future where magic 3D things dance around in my home and create impossible experiences, the Vision Pro is more about being a fantastic wearable display right now, a way to relive movies, and my own photo library and a work-oriented, Apple-connected iOS computer. That's what I thought when I reviewed it, and it remains true now. The Vision Pro is a tool, not necessarily always a magic machine. Still, I use it nearly every day, and there are still moments where the device amazes me with its bleeding-edge features. But I use the Quest 3 nearly every day too…for things I love just as much but can't be done with Apple's headset.
The normal feel of the headset and its apps and user interface -- at times, nearly boring -- could be by design. I think Apple's also trying at times to normalize the experience of a mixed reality face-worn headset, not make it futuristic. Then again, I've also been living in headsets for a long, long time, and I'm still trying to figure out some of the Vision Pro's mysteries.
Movies: Yes, all the time, sometimes
I'm still impressed with how the Vision Pro plays movies. I'm lucky to live with one and enjoy it for that purpose, but of course, the average person wouldn't pay $3,500 just for that privilege. It has, however, become my home movie theater of choice. Mostly.
Catching up on all the Oscar-nominated films in the Vision Pro, I loved the freedom and the fantastic sound quality. Apple TV purchases, like Poor Things and The Zone of Interest, are particularly stunning. Past Lives on Paramount Plus didn't shine as much, because Paramount's non-optimized app doesn't have its own cinema mode, and the video quality is a bit more grainy-looking with the black levels not black enough (maybe that's something to do with the iPad version of the app, I don't know). Maestro looked great on Netflix, but Netflix had to run in Safari, which was fine but a little annoying to launch.
I do find myself watching movies in installments in the headset, maybe an hour at a time. It's not as easy to casually lie down and watch with Vision Pro on. An iPad is a very convenient thing, even if the screens are smaller, and I slip in bits of films that way too. And of course, if I'm watching with my family, I use a TV.
Although I prefer the Vision Pro above all, my eyes get tired sometimes, and I occasionally see the effects of glare or reflection from the display on the lenses. This happens with my own glasses every day, but it's still more than I'd prefer for perfectly crisp, dark movie theater moments in the headset.
Also, while I'd love to take this movie-watching marvel everywhere, the headset is still too large-feeling, with its battery pack, to take on a commute or even on a plane flight. I skipped taking it on a trip to Disney because it would've eaten more than half my backpack. I took an iPad instead, which was great on the plane. No regrets. Maybe when the Vision Pro gets smaller, like a folding pair of goggles (see HTC's Vive XR Elite). But not yet.
Work: Ideally, yes, it's my everyday magic monitor at home
I love putting on the Vision Pro and casting my MacBook display on a big screen. I'm writing this whole story that way, multitasking and opening up other app windows for fun.
The Vision Pro paired with a MacBook Air is my work setup nearly 100% of the time now, seated at my desk with the battery pack connected to a power outlet. I work tethered, essentially. I like the keyboard/trackpad control on the MacBook, and having my office apps function properly; Okta FastPass isn't available on Vision Pro right now, which my workplace uses, so I run things through the MacBook Air.
I prefer this setup to the Quest 3 because more services are already hooked in. Siri is here, notifications go directly to my iOS apps, I can play Apple Music, and it's easy to respond to messages. Also, the display looks better. It's wild to open up multiple apps, bring them close to me and scroll through them with my fingers, like floating iPad displays. I'm doing that now with my social media flow as I work on my Mac. I just need more tiny windows like this and better multitasking, and maybe it'll feel like iPads everywhere.
I miss the flow of all these screens when the headset's off, for sure.
I do leave the headset behind, sometimes: I'm extremely fine to work on my MacBook and my iPhone with a pair of AirPods. The Vision Pro hasn't yet added enough to the equation here. It's a great way to extend displays into what seems like the real room I'm in, but it's not transforming the idea of work yet. There are few magical 3D work apps or transformative interfaces for the most part. I'm keyboarding and trackpad-swiping through 2D windows.
Where are all the magical new apps?
Indeed, where are they? This is what I keep waiting for, but I know I have to be patient: it's been only a month. A new generation of phone apps didn't define the iPhone until years into its existence. A handful of interesting games and apps are here already: Blackbox, a 3D puzzle app, is whimsical and immersive. A game where I control fish through bubbles that float in my office, called Tiny-Fins, is adorable. Wisp World, a mysterious AI-powered conversational creature game that has a floating glowing ball that hovers around a pollen-making plant, is whimsical. Meditation using Apple's Mindfulness app or Tripp Vision is mesmerizing and calming. I don't do these a ton, though. The Vision Pro's ""there's an app for that"" moment is still to come, and I tend to go back to the Quest 3, which has a bigger library of magical immersive experiences I love to play with.
The Vision Pro can open up 3D apps while I'm also using 2D ones (called ""volumes"") so why am I not doing this more? Maybe because I find these apps have a hard way of working in my environment. If I'm at a desk, the 3D apps feel like they're overlapping oddly. I don't stand up with Vision Pro as I do with Quest 3 because its battery pack feels awkward, and it makes me want to sit down. Or there's not a purpose for them. I'd love a Vision Pro Maps app that could show me locations in detail in 3D or GarageBand with real instruments or ways to instantly pop objects I'm browsing into 3D everywhere. But those everyday uses are hiding now or don't exist.
But also, these are very early days. I still don't find these new apps as compelling as I'd like them to be, and I wonder, over time, if discovering and using them along with the rest of my workflow will feel more natural.
And when will this start really blending my realities? I expect an AR future where my floors, furniture, my whole body, everything becomes blended with the virtual. Apple's headset is continually scanning an incredible amount of things, including hands and arms, the dimensions of my room, and my own eyes. And yet, it doesn't invoke a lot of mixed reality tricks except for very subtle ones. Apps mostly feel like they're floating in space, not truly integrating with it, although the Vision Pro is sensing the whole room and my hands continuously and could clearly be doing even more.
Fatigue? After a couple of hours, yes
I can last well over an hour and a half while wearing the Vision Pro, sometimes even more. I lose track of time because I'm usually working and multitasking. I do check my watch, so I know the time but I forget I still have the headset on. And that's when I know I need a good break for my eyes.
It's easier to know I've been in the Quest 3 because it simply doesn't blend with my workflow so seamlessly. That only makes me more aware that I'm dipping in to play games or do fitness.
The head strap I use with the Vision Pro most of the time is the Dual Loop. Properly tightened under the back of my head, it feels perfectly secure and comfy enough. It's like my CPAP strap when I sleep at night, sort of. I don't feel like the headset gets heavy, but I do feel pressure against my cheeks. And my eyes sometimes feel dry. I haven't experienced crying in the headset much (sorry, it takes a lot to move me), but it's annoying to find my eyes get itchy and unable to easily rub them. I like the easier slip-on feel of the other strap, but neither one is perfect. Maybe that's why there are two.
Better, but still buggy
Even using VisionOS 1.1, which has improved how my virtual Persona avatar looks (my digital me for FaceTime and other chats in-headset) and has made connections to the Mac Virtual Display more stable, I still find quirks everywhere. Eye tracking is still imperfect, often causing me to find it hard to select targets on the edges of my vision. Sometimes, I calibrate the eye tracking again after putting the headset back on, but will I need to do this all the time? It's not good enough yet to handle precision controls like my iPhone, iPad or MacBook. Maybe in time, but I need a MacBook trackpad or Magic Trackpad for finesse controls for work.
Sometimes my MacBook connection stops working or -- like today -- my cursor is oddly slow to respond. Sometimes an app quits. Sometimes I find I can't easily select things in Control Center, which hovers overhead like a magic fairy dot. Most of the time it's great, though, and overall it's far more reliable than Meta's Quest OS, but it needs work to be perfect like I need it to be.
When will this start working with my iPhone, Watch and iPad?
One thing I really want to see sooner than later is cross-device interaction with iPhones and the Apple Watch. The MacBook is fine and useful, especially for apps that maybe can't even run in iOS or the Vision Pro, but the device I have next to me all the time is my phone. And my watch. There's already a clever iPhone app called Typos that lets you type on the iPhone and have it easily generate text in Vision Pro. Apple already does this with the Apple TV, and yet it's not on the Vision Pro yet. That would help a ton with text input, and that's just the beginning of what should be a whole universe of interactions. The iPhone is a controller with haptics. Why can't it be that for the Vision Pro, too?
The same goes even moreso for the Apple Watch. For fitness, for gestures and controls, for using the Watch screen as a touchpad for the Vision Pro. I hope this gets introduced this year, because I think it'll help make the headset feel more seamless.
The iPhone should also have its own app to help launch and manage the Vision Pro experiences for guests who try it out, but I already discussed that a few weeks ago.
The iPad would be a great partner for Vision Pro, too. The Magic Keyboard and Trackpad case for the iPad Pro are a lot smaller than a MacBook, and could let me easily lap-control things using another non-MacBook alternative.
But also, I think about collaboration with others. FaceTime collaboration with others who have Vision Pro feels limited to pop-up windows and apps that don't work consistently. With others using iOS or Macs, there are even more seams. I'm hoping that pop-up AR experiences will work with iPhones, iPads and Vision Pro much like a demo I tried of an AR sports game at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference back in 2019.
EyeSight: I barely think about it
One final note: the external EyeSight display that shows my eyes, which seemed so weird and magical, it's almost an afterthought for me. Maybe it's because I usually use the Vision Pro alone. Maybe it's also because the EyeSight display is usually so dim that people around me seem to not see it easily in normal light. My wife says she barely notices it. I forget it's there, and I take the headset off when I need to speak to someone anyway. In a sense, it's not part of my everyday life. I do like that other people can bleed through the Vision Pro's immersive experiences so I can see their faces, if nothing else, for my own awareness and safety. But I don't expect to have conversations with people in the real world while I'm wearing the Vision Pro. At least no more so than I would with the Quest 3 or any other VR headset.
The Vision Pro is impressive, but it also clearly still has limits. How much will that change over the next few months or year? There's no clear indication. Apple's WWDC should tell us more, but until June (or whenever WWDC is), we won't know a lot more about the Vision Pro's future potential. I can tell you now that it's lovely, way too expensive and something I use only sometimes. But yeah, I do have a movie viewing tonight in-headset, which I'm looking forward to.",https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-vision-pro-one-month-later-its-in-my-life-sometimes/

(KABC) -- We're learning more about what led up to a fatal encounter between a 15-year-old at his Apple Valley home and San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies.
A deputy shot and killed Ryan Gainer at his home on Saturday after his family called 911 to report he was attacking his sister and breaking doors and glass at the home.
Body camera video released by the sheriff's department shows the teen charging at a deputy with a sharp gardening tool on a 5-foot pole.
With his gun raised, the deputy shouts ""Hey get back! Get back or you're gonna get shot"" as he tries to retreat. As Ryan continues running at him with the tool, the deputy is seen trying to run away but pointing his gun back as the teen nearly catches up to him.
The released portion of the video ends there, but the department says the teen was struck by gunfire and then later declared deceased at a local hospital.
Ryan's family has retained an attorney, who tells Eyewitness News the boy had autism and was acting out after a dispute over doing household chores.
""Ryan is a 15-year-old with autism, and sometimes in order to release stress or if he he's a little too worked up, he'll go on a run,"" attorney DeWitt Lacy says.
""When he came back there was a dispute that arose because he wanted to play video games, and he needed to do his chores, and he started acting out.""
Gainer's sister called 911 for help. Audio released of that call documents her telling the dispatcher that her brother is attacking his own sister and breaking glass and doors in the home.
There is no indication on the released audio that the family informed the department of his developmental condition.
Neighbors say deputies have been called to the home before. When shown the video, several neighbors differed on whether there was a need to fatally shoot Ryan, or whether the situation could have been de-escalated somehow.
""He'd been struggling with a few things but he was basically a good kid,"" said one neighbor.
Another neighbor said from the video it appeared the deputy had no choice but to protect himself.
""When an officer is attacked with any kind of weapon, especially under that circumstance, seeing that video, I don't know how much of a choice he had not to do what he did,"" said neighbor Joe Gabler.
The sheriff's department's Specialized Investigations Division is investigating the incident.
San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus released a statement acknowledging that society needs to improve its social safety net for people with mental conditions.
""Our deputies handle seemingly insurmountable calls daily. Most of these calls do not end in violence. However, this one ended in tragedy for Ryan, his family, and for the deputies who responded. Rapidly evolving, violent encounters are some of the most difficult, requiring split second decisions. While these decisions are lawful, they are awful in terms of our humanity. I feel for both Ryan's family and my deputies who will struggle with this for their entire lives.""",https://abc7.com/post/deputy-involved-shooting-autism-apple-valley-ryan-gainer/14515552/

A few years later when I began creating video content, I had to switch over to the pricier and heavier MacBook Pro because the increased workload needed the higher-tier Intel processor and fan to keep the machine churning. I also opted for the 16-inch screen size because as I got older, 13-inch screens just felt too cramped.
But Apple really blurred the lines between Pro and Air when it moved all of its laptops over to its self-developed silicon, which are far more energy efficient than Intel processors. Suddenly, the fan that was very much needed to keep an Intel processor from performance throttling became mostly unnecessary. On my M3 Max MacBook Pro, I almost never hear the fan unless I am gaming or exporting a video that’s longer than five minutes long.
And so when Apple launched a 15-inch MacBook Air running on its latest 3-nanometer M3 chip, I was intrigued: could I switch back to the Air for my work needs? The screen size is large enough, and the M3 silicon is extremely efficient, so the Air’s fanless design isn’t the performance compromise it once was. Of course my 16-inch M3 Max MacBook Pro will still be more powerful and render videos faster, but it’s also 3X the cost, thicker and heavier. If the MacBook Air could handle my workflow without feeling too overwhelmed, then I would make the switch back, because the MacBook Pro’s nearly 5-pound weight is taking a toll on my back since I live a car-free lifestyle.
Spoiler alert: the new M3 MacBook Air can indeed handle my workflow, which includes editing 4K videos on Final Cut Pro, editing photos in Adobe Lightroom, and typing words into a CMS on Safari, usually with Slack and Spotify running in the background.
This means I will, in fact, be making the new MacBook Air my work machine when I step out of the apartment. The M3 Max MacBook Pro will become more of a deskbound machine for home use.
Design: If it ain’t broke ...
Other than new color options including the matte grey-ish “Midnight” color I have, the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air looks exactly the same as the last generation M2 MacBook Air. So there is a notch in the display area, and the machine has a more squared-off, boxy look instead of having tapered edges like older MacBook Airs. It’s a well-built, premium feeling machine, with a spacious full-sized keyboard and a large trackpad with strong haptics. There are also six speakers with subwoofers hidden in the part of the laptop that’s covered by the hinge, and sonic output is tremendous for a device this sleek (the laptop measures 0.4-inches thick when closed).
This 15-inch model weighs 3.3 pounds, which is 1.6 pounds lighter than the 16-inch MacBook Pro. It may not sound like a lot, but if you walk 12,000 steps a day with your laptop in a backpack along with camera gear, every pound cut matters. My backpack immediately felt lighter when I took out the 16-inch Pro and swapped it with the 15-inch Air. Even the backpack straps do not dig into my shoulders as much.
The 15-inch LED screen is fine. It looks good in a vacuum but really nothing to write home about if you’re a techie. In terms of resolution or display panel technology, Apple’s MacBooks consistently lag the competition. There are rival Windows laptops with higher res OLED screens, thinner bezels, higher refresh rate, higher peak brightness, etc. But I use my laptop for productivity, not consuming immersive content, so I really do not mind. I think most people are the same way. In this day and age, we consume most of our content on phones and tablets far more than a laptop.
I want to reiterate: this screen doesn’t look bad at all — colors are accurate, and Apple automatically warms the screen at night to make it easier on the eyes — but just that there are other laptops out there with punchier screens.
Performance: Apple silicon keeps the lead
What sets this laptop apart is the M3 chip. Built on 3-nanometer processing, the M3 continues the M chips’ run of dominance. It’s extremely powerful, reaching benchmark numbers that rival Intel processors, but is much more efficient.
The big issue with Intel processors is that they are very power hungry and gets warm. The fan kicks in frequently and often to keep the processor cool. And if you unplug the laptop from a wall socket and operate on battery power, you see a noticeable performance dip with Intel laptops. That’s not the case with Apple silicon. Whether the laptop is plugged in or unplugged, you get similar performance, and as I mentioned earlier, my MacBook Pro rarely ever uses its fan because the M chip doesn’t get hot enough. So this means the fanless MacBook Air really isn’t losing out much.
The model I’m testing has 16GB of RAM (the laptop starts at 8GB), with an 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine. And I’ve been able to edit videos on Final Cut Pro without issues. I scrub through the timeline and there are no stutters. I can export a 10-minute long video in about 13 minutes, which is four times slower than what it took my M3 Max MacBook Pro, but considering the price gap between the two machines (and difference in bulk), I think it’s an acceptable compromise. I’m willing to wait an extra 8-10 minutes per video if it means I can carry a lighter machine.
Keep in mind, putting together a 10-minute long 4K video is already a more intensive task than what most people do. Most people’s laptop needs are just typing/reading words, streaming videos and music, sending emails, and video calls. For these tasks, of course the M3 has no issue.
Of course, there are creative professionals whose workflow are more complicated than mine, like a 3D graphics artist, or a professional videographer who edits 8K video, or do major color grading to LOG files. For them, they may still need the MacBook Pro. But for the majority of people, the Air really is enough.
There’s AI stuff too...
Apple has been marketing this laptop as an “AI laptop,” because the 16-core Neural Engine here allows the MacBook Air to run on-device LLMs and generative AI apps. But really, older M chips can already do that. The Neural Engine isn’t new. However, the M3’s is a bit faster, so you can get results faster. But nonetheless, Apple suddenly pivoting to mentioning AI seems to be Apple uncharacteristically not wanting to feel left out of recent tech trends.
Extremely good battery life
The MacBook Air can last almost two full work days for basic office productivity use. If you’re editing videos like me, then the battery drains much faster, lasting about four to five hours. But regardless, these numbers are much better than most Intel-powered laptops.
Charging can be done via either of the two USB-C ports, and the MagSafe port. The laptop charges at a maximum speed of about 70W. Those two USB-C ports can now also output to two external monitors, which previous M-powered MacBook Airs could not.
The perfect mix of portability and power
The 13-inch MacBook Air is the most popular laptop worldwide. From Singapore to Hong Kong, Barcelona to Berlin, it’s the laptop I see most at coffee shops. But I think the 15-inch could overtake it in popularity eventually. I think consumer trends have shown that consumers are okay with going with larger screen if the overall footprint doesn’t bulk up too much. And in today’s age where more and more people are foregoing owning a conventional computer in favor of a laptop, I think people would want a bit larger screen than 13-inch.
I think this 15-inch MacBook Air is going to be very popular with digital nomads, or anyone who loves to take their laptop and work outside. Its $1,300 starting price is very reasonable given the power and performance it provides. I think Apple products are generally overpriced compared to what the competition is offering, but the MacBook Air may be the exception. It’s the one Apple device that’s actually a better value than rivals.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/bensin/2024/03/11/apple-m3-macbook-air-review-the-15-inch-is-the-perfect-digital-nomad-machine/

Apple Car may never happen, but that doesn't mean the company didn't develop some impressive tech while the project was still alive.
According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple had developed an incredibly mighty chip to power the Apple Car. In a Q&A session on Monday, Gurman said that the chip was nearly finished, and was ""equal to about four M2 Ultras combined.""
The M2 Ultra is the chip that's inside the Mac Pro and the most powerful configuration of the Mac Studio. It has, at most, a 24-core CPU, a 76-core GPU, and a 32-core Neural Engine, with support for up to 192GB RAM. Modern cars do require very powerful silicon; for example, the Tesla FSD (Full Self-Driving) chip has 12 ARM CPUs inside and a total of 6 billion transistors. But if Gurman's info is correct, Apple's chip probably would have dwarfed that, as a single M2 Ultra chip has 134 billion transistors.

Apple was rumored to be building an autonomous car for a decade, spending billions, before reportedly killing off the project and focusing on Apple CarPlay instead.
Gurman also shared a few other tidbits related to Apple's now-abandoned Apple Car project, as well as the company's ongoing CarPlay efforts. For example, he doesn't think that Apple will sell or license the tech developed for the Apple Car project, though ""there’s a good chunk of material that could be reused for the company’s own future products.""
As for CarPlay, Gurman thinks Apple is ""all-in on the new CarPlay,"" which runs through the iPhone, but going forward, he thinks that ""Apple really should embed its own software and hardware into cars themselves,"" something that Google has already done with Android Automotive.

It's a major reversal for Apple. The company has for years fought against web downloads of iPhone software — often called sideloading — citing security issues and Apple's right to dictate its user experience.
Tuesday's announcement is the latest example of the Digital Markets Act forcing Apple to make long-resisted changes to its App Store business processes. The DMA is designed to compel ""gatekeepers"" — big tech companies including Apple — to open their platforms to smaller rivals.
The web download program will start later this spring and requires developers to meet ""specific criteria,"" such as having an app with over 1 million downloads in Europe. Apple will still collect a fee, it said.
Apple said companies can also offer an app store for iPhones in Europe, so long as it only offers access to one company's apps.
""Distributing apps directly from a website requires responsibility and oversight of the user experience, including the ability to manage apps and provide customer support and refunds,"" Apple said on a support page posted Tuesday. ""Apple will authorize developers after meeting specific criteria and committing to ongoing requirements that help protect users.""
Under the DMA, Apple has been forced to allow third-party app stores in Europe, has reinstated antitrust adversary Epic Games' developer account amid a legal dispute, and has backtracked on banning web app shortcuts on the main iPhone screen. Apple's moves suggest the European Commission will be able to successfully regulate Apple in the region by threatening fines and other action for non-compliance.
European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager said the European Commission was checking with Apple's rivals such as Spotify — which supported Apple being hit with a recent $1.95 billion EU fine over a related app store practice called steering — to make sure that Apple's new policies comply with the spirit of the law.
""We will want to hear from third parties,"" Vestager told CNBC on Monday. ""Do they get what the DMA is supposed to give them, which is an open market?""
Apple still plans to charge a fee of fifty Euro cents for app downloads outside of its App Store, including web app downloads. Apple's App Store fees are a profit center for the company, reported in the company's services business, which delivered $78 billion in sales in the company's fiscal 2023, including subscriptions and other items.
The company has said Europe represents about 7% of Apple's App Store revenue.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/apple-will-allow-iphone-app-downloads-from-websites-in-europe.html

Understand that ADP protects data from prying eyes, iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other devices, while iCloud protects your data by enabling a 28-digit recovery key (write it down) and a recovery contact (recovery) if you lose access.","(""Apple"" OR ""AAPL"") -gossip -celebrity -""fantasy sports"" -""game recap""",2024-03-11,AAPL,2026-01-19T17:33:08.897280-05:00,"Apple is fairly consistent in rolling out new security and privacy options for its users, and one of the latest to be pushed to the public at large is Advanced Data Protection. As the name suggests, it gives you more protection for your data—and it's something that the majority of iPhone owners should be enabling.
The setting specifically affects data you're syncing to Apple's iCloud web storage service, so primarily photos, videos, notes, and anything you've stashed in the iCloud Drive app on your device. Turning on ADP ensures more of this data is end-to-end encrypted, which means completely locked up using some incredibly complex algorithms. Only devices you've authorized will be able to unlock this data, and the files will be impenetrable to everyone else (including Apple), both on your devices and in the cloud.
As long as all your Apple devices—iPhones, iPads, Macs—are running the latest software versions, you can enable ADP. Though making more of your data more secure sounds like an easy decision, there are some considerations to weigh up before you switch on this setting.
End-to-end encryption is the gold standard for apps and data. As long as the encryption is implemented properly, it's virtually impossible for anyone else but you to look at files protected by end-to-end encryption. That includes the companies developing your apps, governments, and law enforcement agencies. It's a feature you should look for in all of the digital apps and services you use.
By default, Apple applies end-to-end encryption to certain types of data, including your stored passwords, everything in Safari, your health data, your payment information, everything you do in Apple Maps, and your chats with Siri. That's all fully protected from prying eyes without you having to do anything.
ADP extends that protection pretty considerably to also cover your iCloud backups, iCloud Drive, and the information in Photos, Notes, and Reminders. Without ADP enabled, this data is still encrypted, which adds a strong layer of protection from third parties or bad actors. But Apple can still access this data and turn it over to the cops.
End-to-end encryption closes that loophole. If an Apple employee decides to go rogue, or Apple gets hacked and your files get leaked—and neither of those scenarios have happened, to our knowledge—ADP will ensure your data is still safe. It also means Apple can't get your files back if you lose access to them: The passcodes and passwords on your Apple devices are the only route through which end-to-end encrypted data can be unlocked. Apple has a full and comprehensive explanation of iCloud’s security and privacy features.
So, do you need ADP? If you want the most complete level of security and privacy possible, then yes. Just make sure you have backup methods for recovering your account (more on this in a moment), as Apple won't be able to help you unlock your encrypted files if your account becomes inaccessible. While the default, standard encryption Apple puts in place is already very strong, ADP covers more of your data, which is reassuring in the slim chance Apple's data centers suffer a breach or the FBI wants to take a look at your iCloud files.
It's also worth bearing in mind that all this extra encryption restricts iCloud access in your web browser (the web portal where you can get at your emails, photos, and so on). You can still log in to iCloud on the web, but you'll need to confirm the connection on a trusted device (like an iPhone or Mac) every single time you log in—and you'll need to reauthorize the link every hour while you browse your files. If you use iCloud on the web a lot, you might find life more convenient without ADP enabled.
If you're ready to enable ADP, you can do it right from your iPhone—as long as all the devices associated with your Apple ID are running the latest software, and your Apple ID has two-factor authentication switched on. (If you haven't yet done this, you'll find instructions on the Apple website.)
If you're using an iPhone or an iPad, open Settings, then tap your name at the top. Choose iCloud, then Advanced Data Protection: You'll see a screen briefly explaining how the feature works, and you can tap Turn On Advanced Data Protection to do just that. At this point you'll be told if there are any devices connected to your Apple ID that aren't compatible with ADP, and you’ll be given the option to “remove” them. If you do remove a device, it will no longer be linked to your Apple ID, and it won't sync to your iCloud account, so it's not recommended you “remove” any devices you're still using. A better option would be to update the software on these devices to make them compatible with ADP, or replace the devices with newer versions.
On the next screen, you'll be invited to set up new recovery methods, or review the existing recovery methods that you've previously put in place. This is how you'll be able to get your data back if you ever lose access to your trusted Apple devices (through fire, theft, or whatever it is).
The two recovery methods are a 28-digit recovery key (write this down and keep this in a safe place), and a recovery contact who can help you get back into your account. If you ever need to manage these settings, you'll find the option on the same screen as Advanced Data Protection. Once you've verified your account recovery methods and entered your iPhone passcode to confirm you are who you say you are, ADP will be enabled across your Apple account.
It's easy to enable ADP from a Mac as well. Open the Apple menu, choose System Settings, then click on your name (top left) and iCloud. Select Advanced Data Protection, read the information provided, then click Turn On. You'll be taken through the same recovery method setup process as iOS and iPadOS, if needed.
You can reverse this process and disable ADP at any time to go back to the standard level of protection. Return to the same screens on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to turn Advanced Data Protection off. When you do, the encryption keys to access your files will once again be available to Apple, rather than just your devices.",https://www.wired.com/story/how-apple-advanced-data-protection-works-and-how-to-turn-it-on/

The Apple Car was once one of the most highly-anticipated Apple products of all time. For a decade, rumors about the secretive Apple electric vehicle project made headlines in tech publications and Apple blogs.
Then, just weeks ago, news broke that Apple officially killed the project known as Project Titan. There will be no Apple Car.
Now, Bloomberg's Apple insider, Mark Gurman, has some very interesting details about what the Apple Car would have looked like. And, reader, it's nothing like you would have imagined.
Apple was working on a minivan
Try to think of what an EV made by Apple would have looked like. Are you thinking of a potential Tesla competitor? Maybe a sleek, sexy sports cars?
You'd be wrong.
Apple was working on a minivan, according to a report by Bloomberg's Gurman.
The Apple Car went through several design iterations in the decade it was under development, Gurman says. However, each one of them is heavily influenced by minivan designs by automobile manufacturers over the years.
The initial concept for the Apple Car was created by the company's iconic designer, Jony Ive, who left Apple in 2019. That Apple Car design was dubbed the ""Bread Loaf"" internally at the company. Why? Because it looked like a ""modern incarnation"" of the 1950s Volkswagen microbus.
If you're not familiar with the Volkswagen microbus, also known as the VW Type 2 or VW Camper or Vanagon, you almost definitely know what it looks like. It's the VW van typically portrayed as being driven by hippies in the 60s or by touring rock bands from that era. It's the yellow van used in the 2006 film, Little Miss Sunshine starring Steve Carrell, Abigail Breslin, and Toni Collette.
A Volkswagen camper-inspired design
Later versions of the Apple Car changed the design somewhat, but the old school Volkswagen minivan-inspired aesthetic remained.
The second Apple Car design, according to Gurman, looked ""nearly identical"" to the 2017 Volkswagen ID Buzz prototype. This EV concept car was also inspired by the VW microbus, albeit with a more modern design, with a sloped hood. Interestingly, Gurman mentions that this Apple Car design came before Volkswagen announced its 2017 prototype.
The Apple Car went through some more minor changes over the years before landing on its most recent design concept from 2020. According to Gurman, that last Apple Car design resembled a vehicle by the California-based electric car company, Canoo.
The last version of the Apple Car resembled the Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle, which Gurman describes as a ""futuristic van with rounded edges."" Taking a look at the Canoo EV, it certainly does look like something you'd imagine for Apple's take on a minivan. The front and back of the vehicle would also look exactly the same, so the Apple Car would've always looked like it was driving forward.
One of the last design change-ups to this version of the Apple Car was to trade in sliding doors commonly found on a minivan for gull-wing doors.
As for the interior, Apple was going for a minimalist design with a focus on roominess for the occupants of the vehicle. It could've potentially included TVs and/or iPads for FaceTime and video playback, a special A/C system that would flow air through the sides of the vehicle, and a reclining, private jet-esque seating design with swiveling front seats.
According to Gurman's report, Apple executives including CEO Tim Cook were big fans of the last design. But, ultimately, the company decided to pull the plug on the Apple Car — and all we're left with are these reports about what could have been.

Personal devices have adopted diverse authentication methods, including biometric recognition and passcodes. In contrast, headphones have limited input mechanisms, depending solely on the authentication of connected devices. We present Moonwalk, a novel method for passive user recognition utilizing the built-in headphone accelerometer. Our approach centers on gait recognition; enabling users to establish their identity simply by walking for a brief interval, despite the sensor’s placement away from the feet. We employ self-supervised metric learning to train a model that yields a highly discriminative representation of a user’s 3D acceleration, with no retraining required. We tested our method in a study involving 50 participants, achieving an average F1 score of 92.9% and equal error rate of 2.3%. We extend our evaluation by assessing performance under various conditions (e.g. shoe types and surfaces). We discuss the opportunities and challenges these variations introduce and propose new directions for advancing passive authentication for wearable devices.

As the repository of publicly available pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs) — such as CLIP, DINOv2, and SAM — grows, users face challenges in storage, memory, and computational efficiency when deploying multiple models concurrently. To address these concerns, we introduce a unique approach that merges the capabilities of multiple VFMs into a single efficient multi-task model. Our method, termed “joint distillation,” seamlessly integrates teacher-student learning with self-distillation, operating with just unlabeled image data and drastically cutting down on computational requirements compared to traditional multi-task learning. In a practical demonstration of merging CLIP and SAM, we reveal that the resultant merged model, SAM-CLIP, not only maintains the foundational strengths of both parent models but also uncovers synergistic functions, such as text-prompted zero-shot segmentation. Given the increasing availability of VFMs, our methodology promises to deliver significant value in streamlining model deployment and operations.

Vision-Based Hand Gesture Customization from a Single Demonstration
AuthorsSoroush Shahi, Cori Tymoszek Park, Richard Kang, Asaf Liberman, Oron Levy, Jun Gong, Abdelkareem Bedri, Gierad Laput
Hand gesture recognition is becoming a more prevalent mode of human-computer interaction, especially as cameras proliferate across everyday devices. Despite continued progress in this field, gesture customization is often underexplored. Customization is crucial since it enables users to define and demonstrate gestures that are more natural, memorable, and accessible. However, customization requires efficient usage of user-provided data. We introduce a method that enables users to easily design bespoke gestures with a monocular camera from one demonstration. We employ transformers and meta-learning techniques to address few-shot learning challenges. Unlike prior work, our method supports any combination of one-handed, two-handed, static, and dynamic gestures, including different viewpoints. We evaluated our customization method through a user study with 20 gestures collected from 21 participants, achieving up to 97% average recognition accuracy from one demonstration. Our work provides a viable path for vision-based gesture customization, laying the foundation for future advancements in this domain.

Human Following in Mobile Platforms with Person Re-Identification
AuthorsMario Srouji, Jian Zhang, Hugues Thomas
Human following serves an important human-robotics interaction feature, while real-world scenarios make it challenging particularly for a mobile agent. The main challenge is that when a mobile agent try to locate and follow a targeted person, this person can be in a crowd, be occluded by other people, and/or be facing (partially) away from the mobile agent. To address the challenge, we present a novel person re-identification module, which contains three parts: 1) a 360-degree visual registration process, 2) a neural-based person re-identification mechanism by multiple body parts - human faces and torsos, and 3) a motion model that records human’s motion and predicts human’s future position. In addition to the person re-idenfication module, our human-following system also tackles other challenges, such as 1) the targeted person can be fast-moving (the need of the system running at a low latency for person identification), 2) the targeted person can move out of the camera sight (the need of searching for the person without sight), and 3) collision avoidance (the need of avoiding hitting obstacles). Through extensive experiments, we observe that our proposed person re-identification module greatly improve human-following feature when compared to other baseline variants.

Apple MacBook Basics: The Differences Between MacBook Air and MacBook Pro
Let's state something obvious right from the start: The MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro may have some striking similarities, but they aren't the same machine. They use different designs, include different features, and are made for different users. In the case of the MacBook Air, it's Apple's general-use Mac laptop, made for mainstream productivity and peak portability at an approachable price.
The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is Apple's prosumer model, made for both consumers and professionals. Some configurations may be similar in terms of CPU and price, but if you're willing to invest a little more, you can get the MacBook Pro with more powerful processors and more ports in a build that's designed to squeeze better performance out of the silicon inside.
It's only in the MacBook Pro's most basic configurations that you'll find significant overlap with the MacBook Air. But, if you're on the fence about which one to get, we understand! They do look mighty similar, and the differences between them can be nuanced. So let's look at both models and figure out how they differ and which is better for you.
Power and Performance: It's All Down to Fans (or No Fans)
Let's start with the most common point of comparison: performance. If the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro are using the same M3 processor, doesn't that mean that you'll get the same performance regardless of which model you choose?
Well, it's not quite that simple. The same M3 processor may be used in both models, as well as the same 10-core GPU in both of our review units, but you'll quickly notice one major difference: the cooling schemes.
The MacBook Air uses a passive cooling system, meaning that it may be well-ventilated, with enough natural airflow through the chassis to support performance for short bursts, but you'll hear no fans inside. On the plus side, that means it runs silently, even when you're doing demanding work like photo editing. But that silence has a downside: With no fans pushing the hot air out and drawing cool air in, the M3 chip will hit its thermal limits more quickly than if it had fan assistance.
The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, has two internal cooling fans, plus a more sophisticated heat-exchange system that pumps out the heat and draws in cool air, adjusting airflow to match the demands of your workload. Yes, it does mean that the MacBook Pro will emit some fan noise, and the fans add some thickness and weight to the chassis. But that difference in airflow has a direct impact on performance: The M3 MacBook Pro outperformed the M3 MacBook Air in just about every benchmark we've conducted on the two, namely the ones that carry out more-sustained workloads.
The MacBook Air may be able to match the Pro for short sprints of activity, but for longer, more-involved projects (or gaming sessions, for that matter), those fans will let the MacBook Pro perform better and do so for longer. The MacBook Air, on the other hand, hits its thermal limits much faster, and the system throttles the performance in response.
Winner: Apple MacBook Pro 14-Inch (2023, M3)
Portability: A Slight Edge for the Air
The above all said, getting the highest possible performance isn't the first concern for every laptop user. Schlepping around an extra pound of laptop takes its toll when you're constantly running to work, walking across campus, or hauling a laptop bag across the airport to make that flight. That's where Apple's trademark portability comes in.
The MacBook Pro is by no means a chunky laptop. It measures 0.61 inch thick and weighs 3.4 pounds—lighter than half of the models found on our list (when we wrote this) of the best laptops. With a footprint of just 12.3 by 8.7 inches, it will fit comfortably into any laptop bag or backpack.
But the MacBook Air isn't named the ""Air"" for nothing. It's thinner and lighter, at just 0.44 inch thick and 2.7 pounds, shaving several ounces off of the MacBook Pro's carry weight. With the 13-incher measuring just 11.97 by 8.46 inches, it has a slightly more compact footprint.
Steve Jobs famously introduced the first MacBook Air by pulling it out of a manila envelope, highlighting how thin and light the first model was back in 2008. Today, the Air is even thinner and lighter, but enormously more capable, giving you unbeatable portability without sacrificing the performance you need for day-to-day productivity and even bursts of more intense work. Even on our list of the lightest laptops, it's one of the lighter models. If you want unparalleled portability, the MacBook Air is the featherweight champ.

Battery Life: Either Way, It's All-Day
Just as important to the modern user as portability is battery life. We don't see much point in having a laptop that's light enough to carry anywhere if you have to stay tethered to a wall outlet every time you want to use it.
This is where the Apple MacBook Air and MacBook Pro ramp up a rivalry, because the MacBook Pro may have the added power draw of cooling fans, but it also has a larger chassis, and as a result, room for a physically larger battery. The MacBook Air has a 52.6-watt-hour (Whr) battery, rated for 18 hours of video playback or 15 hours of web browsing. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, has a larger 70Whr battery pack inside, with an estimated 22 hours of movie playback, but the same 15 hours of web browsing.
These estimates also track pretty closely to our test results, where we saw the Apple MacBook Air 13-Inch last 21 hours in our video playback test, outperforming Apple's rating, with the MacBook Pro 14-Inch notching 22 hours on that same test.
Both MacBooks are capable of legitimate all-day battery life, with enough endurance to carry you through a full day of work or school, or a cross-country flight.
Winner: Tie
Port Selection: The Pro Has the Edge
Usability in a laptop includes many factors and features, but one of the biggest in day-to-day convenience is port selection. The advent of Thunderbolt 4 and USB-C ports has made high-speed, high-power connectivity easier and more adaptable. You can use Thunderbolt for all sorts of things, from transferring data to external storage with minimal lag to connecting an external display while your laptop charges using the same cable. It's a flexible and commendable connector, which is why so many thin-and-light laptops have seemingly abandoned other ports.
But, as anyone who has tried to plug in a USB mouse or connect to more than two devices can tell you, being stuck with just two ports ain't great!
That's one of the key differences between the MacBook Air, which has a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, and the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which has the same two Thunderbolt 4 ports but adds a full-size HDMI output and an SD card slot to the mix.
That's especially important news for anyone who shoots or edits video, since those added options let you grab data right from your camera's memory card and then easily connect to an external monitor or TV with a standard HDMI cable—no adapter required.
Sure, you can always pack along a docking station or an individual port adapter, but for sheer usability, the extra ports on the MacBook Pro make this an easy Pro win.

Display: Mini LED and More FTW
Both the MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air have sharp, vibrant screens. They display in better-than-full-HD resolution, they deliver excellent color, and they shine with decent brightness. Likewise, the macOS environment is optimized to look excellent on these displays whether you're browsing the web, editing photos and video, or streaming the latest show from Apple TV. However, when we compare the displays of the two laptops, some key differences come clear.
The MacBook Air has a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display panel, while the MacBook Pro uses a slightly larger 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR screen. Will that extra 0.6 inch of screen real estate make a lot of difference? Not much, but it's far from the only distinction.
When we talk about display quality, we're talking about several things: resolution, color quality, and brightness, to name a few. The 13-inch MacBook Air serves up impressive specs on all three fronts, with a 2,560-by-1,664 native resolution (the ""Liquid Retina"" part), 500 nits of brightness, and support for a billion colors, according to Apple. In our testing, the reality isn't quite as bright (363 nits), or as colorful (reproducing 95% of the DCI-P3 color space, instead of the 100% hyped in Apple's product descriptions). But, all in all, a crisp and colorful display.
Apple even adds TruTone technology to ""adjust the color and intensity of your display… to match the ambient light so that images appear more natural."" When it works, it's seamless and keeps documents and graphics alike looking poppy, even as the light dims in the late afternoon.
But the MacBook Pro's Liquid Retina XDR screen has more than that going for it. For starters, it has a sharper 3,024-by-1,964 native resolution, with a slightly higher pixel density, so details look a bit sharper, and letters are just a bit more legible at smaller sizes. The system pumps out the same billion colors, but in our tests, its superior screen captures more of them, with 98% DCI-P3 reproduction, instead of 95% in the MacBook Air screen.
While it doesn't show up in our standard brightness tests, the MacBook Pro's display does offer higher brightness in some circumstances, thanks to the Pro screen's mini-LED backlighting. Using this tech, the Apple Liquid Retina XDR display shines brighter and adds high dynamic range (HDR) support on top of that, making for more vivid images and more realistic movies and games. (This is what Apple refers to as Extreme Dynamic Range, or XDR, which it claims is a step above HDR.)
Panel speed is also a factor. Apple's faster 120Hz ProMotion adaptive refresh rate is exclusive to the MacBook Pro line. ProMotion allows the display to scale the refresh rate (up to 120Hz) for smoother, more eye-friendly performance depending on whether you're looking at a document, watching a movie, or playing a fast-paced game.
The bottom line: The 14-inch MacBook Pro has a profoundly better display.
Winner: Apple MacBook Pro 14-Inch (2023, M3)
External Monitor Support: They're Equals, With the Same Caveat
Now here's a feature where the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro are exactly the same. Thanks to a recent software update, the MacBook Pro with M3 can support two external displays with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz—perfectly matching the demands of the Apple Studio Display.
Both the Air and the Pro have this dual-display support, but only with the lid closed. Due to limitations in the processor, you can run two 5K external monitors with the lid closed, or a single Apple Studio Display with the laptop's own display working and powered up.
If you shelled out the thousands of dollars for the more intense Apple Pro Display XDR, both models will support that, too, with the ability to run, per Apple, ""One external display with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz."" (We didn't have the opportunity to try it.) Naturally, the more powerful M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro models don't suffer these limitations.
Winner: Tie
Price: An Air Win, Between Base Models
The 13-inch MacBook Air starts at $1,099 for the most basic model with the M3 chip. That means the eight-core CPU with an eight-core GPU, 8GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD. You can scale that up with two more GPU cores, extra memory (up to 24GB), and as much as 2TB of storage, with a top price of $2,299. Our review model was somewhere in the middle, with a 10-core GPU, 16GB of memory, and 512GB of SSD storage, selling for $1,499.
The 14-inch MacBook Pro, on the other hand, starts at $1,599, a full $500 more than the base-model MacBook Air. The specs aren't exactly the same, as the M3 base model of the Pro comes with the 10-core GPU and 512GB SSD that are step-up options for the Air, but otherwise, the two are similar: with 8GB of RAM and the same M3 CPU. Increases in memory and storage are also the same, with a max memory of 24GB and top storage of 2TB. All told you can spec up the M3 MacBook Pro to the tune of $2,599—$300 more than the peak version of the M3 Air with similar specs.
However, the M3-based MacBook Pro scales higher, because you aren't limited to the M3 chip alone. You can jump up to the M3 Pro (11- or- 12-core CPU, 14- or- 18-core GPU) or the more powerful M3 Max (14- or- 16-core CPU, 30- or- 40-core GPU) and then add even more memory and storage. You can ramp up the memory to 128GB, or the storage to 8TB with the right CPU choice, and the price can jump as high as $6,899, which gets you an extremely powerful workstation laptop.
Let's set aside those higher-priced options for this comparison, though, since nobody is weighing the MacBook Air against a MacBook Pro that's thousands of dollars more expensive. In the case of the starter models, the difference is a few hundred dollars between the MacBook Air and a similarly equipped MacBook Pro.
That being the case, the Air is cheaper, but with the caveat that you lose out on some of the high-end features and power discussed above. If you want an effective general-use laptop, that makes the Air a better deal, but it's highly dependent on your individual needs.

MacBook Air 13-Inch vs. MacBook Pro 14-Inch: So, Which MacBook Is the Better Pick for You?
With so many similarities between the 13-inch MacBook Air and the 14-inch MacBook Pro, the question of which is better for you will largely be a question of whether you prioritize performance or portability.
If it's a question of power, along with port selection and display quality, then the 14-inch Apple MacBook Pro with M3 chip is the smarter choice of the two, since it delivers better processing and graphics performance, plus more ports. The price is much higher, but the display is also bigger, brighter, faster, and sharper—so that extra few hundred dollars isn't purely down to speed. This is why it's found on so many of our ""best laptop"" lists.
But that higher price can pinch when you're on a budget, whether it's for your bustling household or if you're a broke college student who needs something for class. That's a huge part of what makes the 13-inch version of the Apple MacBook Air so appealing. For a bit less than the MacBook Pro, you get the same M3 chip, with much the same general performance for daily tasks, all in a lightweight package that you can take with you as easily as you would a print magazine. If price and portability are your chief concerns, the 13-inch, M3-equipped MacBook Air is an award-winning favorite for a reason.
Finally, consider one last difference between the Air and the Pro that might help you make your decision: While the 14-inch MacBook Pro is sold in just two colors (Space Grey and Silver), the 13-inch MacBook Air comes in four, adding Starlight Gold and Midnight Black to the available finishes. Do those color options change the performance or portability of their respective MacBooks? Not a bit. Of course, we won't judge you for making a choice based on chassis color—assuming you've weighed everything else!",https://www.pcmag.com/comparisons/which-m3-laptop-should-you-buy-apple-macbook-air-13-inch-vs-macbook-pro?test_uuid=04IpBmWGZleS0I0J3epvMrC&test_variant=B

The about-face disclosed Friday is the latest twist in a bitter fight between Apple and Epic Games, the maker of the popular Fortnite video game, over the way iPhone apps are distributed and the fees for digital transactions that occur within them.
Apple attributed the change of heart to reassurances from Epic that it won’t violate its requirements for getting access to iPhone owners. Epic had brazenly broke the rules in the U.S. in 2020 to trigger an antitrust lawsuit alleging Apple’s App Store is a monopoly.
After a month-long trial, a federal judge in 2021 rejected most of Epic’s claims in a ruling that withstood appeals, but the bickering with Apple has continued.
Apple had rejected Epic’s attempt to set up an account that would have allowed it to set up an alternative store for downloading iPhone apps — something that Apple has held exclusive control over for more than 15 years.
But a new set of regulations called the Digital Marketing Act, or DMA, that took effect in European Union’s 27-nation bloc earlier this week cleared the way for other companies to compete against Apple’s App Store — an opportunity that Epic was eager to seize upon.
Epic CEO Tim Sweeney had alleged Apple’s actions to stymie its efforts to open an app store in Europe were part of its efforts to retaliate against the video game maker for challenging a system that has been a huge money maker for the iPhone maker. Apple collects commissions ranging from 15% to 30% for digital transactions completed within iPhone apps, an arrangement that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue for the company while spurring complaints from Epic and other companies who rail against the fees as monopolistic price gouging.
European regulators signaled Apple’s rejection of Epic’s effort to set up an iPhones app developer account in Europe, based in Sweden, might run afoul of the DMA, raising the specter of potentially a substantial fine.
Apple didn’t mention the regulatory approval in a brief statement saying it is now satisfied Epic will follow all its rules.
Sweeney applauded regulators for taking swift action to rein in Apple in a social media post that hailed the outcome as “a big win for European rule of law, for the European Commission, and for the freedom of developers worldwide to speak up.”
The bad blood between Apple and Epic is far from over. Apple is demanding more than $73 million from Epic to cover its fees in the U.S. antitrust case over the App Store. A hearing on that demand, which Epic has described as outlandish in court papers, is scheduled later this month.",https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-reverses-course-clears-way-epic-games-set-rival-iphone-app-store-rcna142741

Apple has recently been making big changes to how it runs its core platforms in order to comply with the EU's new Big Tech regulations known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
After weeks of unveiling new – and often controversial – new policies, Apple announced one of its most significant DMA-inspired moves yet on Tuesday: Web distribution.
This means that Apple will let app developers distribute their iOS apps to iPhone and iPad users directly through the developers' own websites.

In addition, developers will be allowed to link out to external pages within their apps without having to follow Apple's guidelines or templates for discounts, promotions, and other deals. Companies who choose to set up an ""alternative marketplace"" will also now be allowed to solely distribute their own apps through those platforms.
Apple announced these new EU policy additions in an update on Tuesday titled ""More options for apps distributed in the European Union.""
The way apps are distributed on iOS in the EU will forever change
Apple first announced sweeping changes to its App Store model earlier this year in preparation for the DMA. The new EU regulation officially went into effect last week and forces Big Tech companies, known as ""gatekeepers,"" to open their core platforms to third-parties in order to spur competition.
Apple introduced a slew of DMA-inspired changes that spans all facets of iOS, but its App Store changes were easily the most significant. Due to the DMA, Apple could no longer monopolize app distribution on iOS through the App Store. Apple complied by allowing competitors to the App Store, known as ""alternative marketplaces,"" to distribute apps on iOS devices. Developers who released these apps on these marketplaces would not need to follow Apple's App Store content policies or take part in Apple's App Store revenue share model.
However, its new App Store policies were widely criticized by its peers in the tech industry. Under Apple's DMA-inspired changes, app developers who agree to the company's new terms which allow for ""alternative marketplaces"" will end up being charged a €0.50 ""Core Technology Fee"" for every first annual installation over one million installs. This means that for the very first time, developers could owe money to Apple without pulling in any revenue from its apps.
With that being said, these latest updates from Apple are a step in the right direction but there are more stringent requirements for developers choosing to distribute their apps in this way.
Apple will still require that developers who distribute their apps from their websites be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program. In addition, Apple says those developers must be in ""good standing in the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more, and have an app that had more than one million first annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year."" Apple will also require that those developers take on responsibilities typically reserved for app distributors such as handling government requests and keeping in touch with Apple regarding potential issues such as fraudulent or illegal behavior related to the apps.
One major drawback, though, is that apps distributed directly via a developer's website are still subject to the controversial Core Technology Fee.
And, of course, only app developers in the EU are covered by these new iOS app distribution policies. Everyone else still has to go through Apple's official App Store.

(KABC) -- Deputies shot and killed a 15-year-old at an Apple Valley home Saturday after he allegedly attacked them with a bladed gardening tool, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
The incident unfolded Saturday just before 5 p.m. when deputies were called to a home in the 13400 block of Iroquois Road. Family members reported a 15-year-old was attacking family members and damaging property at the home.
When the first deputy showed up, the department says the 15-year-old, later identified as Ryan Gainer, tried to attack him with a 5-foot-long gardening tool with a sharp blade at the end.
The deputy tried to get away but the department says the teen chased after him, intending to attack him with the blade. The deputy opened fire and Gainer was struck. He was later brought to a local hospital and pronounced dead there.
The department's Specialized Investigations Division is investigating the incident.
The department released a short segment of body camera video showing the deputy arrive to the front door of the home. The teen is seen wielding a long tool in his hand, rushing out the front door toward the deputy.
With his gun drawn, the deputy backs up away from the doorway as the teen approaches.
The deputy shouts ""Hey get back! Get back or you're gonna get shot."" He is first walking back and then running away as the teen runs after him. It appears the deputy lifts his arm to shoot as he is running backwards, with the teen just a few feet away, and then the released portion of the video ends.
Portions of audio from the initial 911 call were also released in which a family member asks for help, saying the teen was attacking his own sister and breaking glass and doors in the home.
San Bernardino County Sheriff Shannon Dicus released a statement about the incident:
""Our social safety net for those experiencing mental illness needs to be strengthened. Our deputies handle seemingly insurmountable calls daily. Most of these calls do not end in violence. However, this one ended in tragedy for Ryan, his family, and for the deputies who responded. Rapidly evolving, violent encounters are some of the most difficult, requiring split second decisions. While these decisions are lawful, they are awful in terms of our humanity. I feel for both Ryan's family and my deputies who will struggle with this for their entire lives.""",https://abc7.com/post/deputy-involved-shooting-apple-valley-san-bernardino-county-sheriffs-department/14512144/

Apple Inc is expanding in China with new applied research labs, in a fresh move to tap into the country's manufacturing and research and development prowess to make the best products, a senior executive of the company said on Tuesday.
The move means that Apple is the latest multinational company to seek growth opportunities in China amid its innovation boom, as the nation sharpens its focus on nurturing new quality productive forces.
Experts said China remains a magnet for foreign high-tech investment, and multinational companies' enthusiasm to expand their local R&D presence reflects the appeal and vitality of the world's second-largest economy amid external uncertainties and challenges.
Isabel Ge Mahe, vice-president and managing director of Apple Greater China, told China Daily: ""We have already invested 1 billion yuan ($139.4 million) into an applied research lab in China. And with the new expansion plan, our investment will continue growing.""
She said that Apple will establish a new applied research lab in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, later this year, deepening cooperation and strengthening testing and research capabilities for its products.
Meanwhile, the US tech company is enhancing the capabilities of its Shanghai applied research lab to support the reliability, quality and material analysis of all of its product lines.
""We choose to have the two labs in China, because of the country's manufacturing prowess and local suppliers' strong presence,"" she said.
Apple has R&D centers in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Suzhou, Jiangsu province, and its R&D workforce in China has doubled over the past five years.
""They play a crucial role in Apple's product innovation,"" she added. ""The investment shows our long-term commitment to the Chinese market, and will inject new vitality into local innovation and supply chain development.""
Apple, which has been in China for over three decades, is scheduled to open its eighth store in Shanghai next week. As a result, it will have 47 stores on the Chinese mainland, second only to the US, and this comes amid intensified competition with Chinese smartphone makers such as Huawei Technologies Co.
Bai Ming, a researcher at the Beijing-based Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, said Apple's latest investment ""speaks volumes about China's appeal to foreign companies despite geopolitical uncertainties and global subdued investment sentiment"".
Apple is not alone in expressing its strong confidence in China as an innovation hub. French industrial and tech company Schneider Electric SE established a string of research institutes in China in 2023, including a digital power distribution R&D center, an automation R&D center and an AI innovation lab.
Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School, said, ""As China beefs up its tech clout, more foreign companies will build R&D centers in the country, showing that China is not just a market, but also an important source of innovation.""
In 2023, China's R&D investment exceeded 3.3 trillion yuan, up 8.1 percent year-on-year, and funding for fundamental research reached 221.2 billion yuan, an annual rise of 9.3 percent, according to the Ministry of Science and Technology.",https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202403/12/WS65f072c3a31082fc043bc3de.html

iPhone Security: The Final Decision
FAQ
The Truth about iPhone Security
Apple might have one of the most secure operating systems, but it’s still experienced its fair share of vulnerabilities. From malware-ridden apps to OS security holes, iPhone users face a multitude of security risks. Let’s look at the most common risks in more detail.
Unsecured Apps
Apple is strict about which apps it lets you download, but that doesn’t mean dodgy ones don’t find their way onto the App Store. Some untrustworthy apps come with hidden malware, which can compromise your device security. Just downloading the app can be enough to give a cybercriminal control of your device. They can snoop on anything, including your photos, online banking, passwords, and private messages. You might not even know they’re watching.
Other spammy apps could be spying on your details or forcing you to pay for services. In 2022, HT Tech reported over 84 scam apps were found on the App Store, stealing more than $100 million from users every year. Although these ‘fleecewear’ apps didn’t have malware inside, they were filled with extra fees and charges, usually relating to a free trial that had come to an end. Users were often charged multiple times or more than they thought at checkout, but were unable to cancel their subscriptions.
App Flaws
Leaving your apps outdated can expose you to vulnerabilities that can risk your information. Even pre-installed, Apple-based apps aren’t exempt from important security patches. Just before iOS 13.4.1’s release, a hacker managed to find a security flaw within Apple’s email software. This left users exposed to emails containing malicious code. Worryingly, you didn’t even need to open the email for the malicious code to start infecting your device. The attack forced iPhones to reboot, giving hackers full access to email accounts and all stored sensitive details.
OS Security Vulnerabilities
Just like your apps, failing to keep your device up-to-date can make you more vulnerable to threats. If you own an old iPhone, it can create even more risks. Older models typically don’t support the latest iOS, which means you won’t be able to install patches to fix any flaws. It wouldn’t take a hacker long to exploit them and gain access to your device.
Even with newer iPhones, hackers can sometimes manage to attack before Apple can patch the vulnerability. In recent years, malicious actors have been known to target iPhone users with Pegasus spyware, using unpatched bugs to install malware onto people’s devices. One exploit in September 2023 used weaknesses in the Wallet and ImageIO software to send images via iMessage hiding Pegasus malware.
Jailbroken iPhones
Apple security measures mean iPhone users have less control over their devices. Many are resorting to jailbreaking their iPhones for more control – in other words, unlocking the operating system to gain full reign of the device. This lets you install any app, even if it’s not on the App Store, and configure your device however you like. While it gives you more freedom, it means your device isn’t protected by Apple’s security features or automatic updates. It also leaves you exposed to malware-ridden apps, which can threaten your device security.
New iPhone Features
Apple is constantly releasing new features with every upgraded model and new iOS. Many of these rely on you handing over more personal information or sharing data with other iPhone users. One example of this is the Name Drop feature released in iOS 17 which allowed iPhone users to share contact and personal information by holding their phones near one another.
You need permission to share and receive information between devices, ensuring you only connect to devices you trust. But these trusted devices could be compromised by cybercriminals and you may not know, leaving your information at risk of attack.
Risky Links and Downloads
Malicious links and downloads are a risk no matter what device you use. The iPhone is no exception. Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to lure you in and encourage you to hand over your details. This could be an unusual email attachment, a link via iMessage, or even an in-app link that you think is safe. Even if they’re not malicious, they can take you to a website hosting trackers and forms to grab your details and follow you around the web.
Password Snoopers
You might think you’re the only one who knows your six-digit lock screen passcode, but people could be watching you.
In December 2023, one cybercriminal studied people using their iPhones in an attempt to learn their passcodes. He’d then take their phones, change their passwords, and gain access to their online banking apps where he could transfer funds to himself. He’d also befriend victims to appear as someone they trust, then lure them into handing over their passcodes. Even if your iPhone can’t recognize Face ID, someone can easily unlock your phone if they know your passcode.
iPhone Built-In Security Features
Enough of the bad stuff — let’s focus on what Apple does well to keep you secure. Apple has tons of features to enhance your iPhone’s security and keep your information safe, with new ones in every release. Let’s go through the built-in security measures plus extra iPhone features you should be using to protect your security.
OS Security
Apple is known for having one of the most secure operating systems. Unlike Android, Apple’s source code is closed, which means it’s not available for anyone to look at or change, including hackers. We’re not saying it’s perfect, but exploits are much less frequent and tougher for hackers to find.
Apple also implements tough security measures at both hardware and software levels, running intense security checks to ensure the safety of your device. One of the most important features is Secure Boot, which protects your iPhone against malware from the moment it’s turned on. This works by validating the operating system to ensure only Apple-approved software can run on your device when it starts up.
App Security Control
Apple’s so-called ‘walled garden’ is tough to get around. Apple checks every app in the App Store before accepting it, ensuring only verified apps are available to iPhone users. It verifies that apps haven’t been altered or tampered with, which could indicate security issues. This significantly reduces the risk of apps hiding malware that could compromise the security of your iPhone. Although it can be frustrating if you don’t see the app you want for available download, know that it’s only because Apple can’t verify its security. After all, it’s better to be safe than sorry.
iPhone Access
If you don’t already have a passcode enabled on your iPhone, make it your next priority. Your six-digit lock screen code is one of the most important features for protecting your device, and is possibly the most simple to implement. You can enable biometric login with Face ID and Touch ID to make it harder to unlock your phone. Apple also has a Find My iPhone feature which helps you locate your device if it’s lost or stolen. Once activated, it’ll stop anyone who has your device from accessing it.
One of Apple’s newest features includes Stolen Device Protection to block thieves from breaking through your iPhone. This feature forces you to use Face ID and Touch ID for other actions, rather than just to unlock your phone or make payments. It also creates a security delay alongside biometric checks for more sensitive actions, like changing your Apple ID or removing fingerprint scanning, to stop individuals from making changes to your device.
Account Logins and iCloud Protection
Apple implements Passkeys to make logins safer. Rather than logging in with a username and password that someone could potentially steal, you can log in to an account using Face ID or Touch ID. You can also save all of your logins to the iCloud Keychain which is encrypted and only you can access it with another password. Since every Passkey is uniquely generated, there’s much less chance a cybercriminal can breach your password.
To help keep your credentials safe, iPhones can suggest strong passwords with highly unique and hard-to-guess combinations that it’ll remember for you. For any weak passwords, your iPhone will nudge you to change them into a stronger combination. This makes it much harder for thieves to find your details or gain access to multiple accounts.
Information Sharing
Your iPhone and the apps you use can share huge amounts of data, including your location, search history, and personal details. The more data you share, the more at risk you are of someone accessing your information and stealing it. Thankfully, there are ways to limit data sharing.
All apps ask your permission to share information when you first install them. You can amend these permissions at any time through Privacy & Security within Settings on your iPhone. You can turn Location Services off completely, which stops your iPhone from following your movements. You can also click on individual apps to deny or allow location tracking, or set rules such as only tracking your location while using the app.
You can review tracking permissions to prevent apps from logging your data for extra security. If they can’t track you, that means there’s less data to sell to third parties or for cybercriminals to steal. Open Tracking within Privacy & Security and switch the toggle for Allow Apps to Request to Track off. This blocks tracking requests and stops apps from tracking you on other sites. If you scroll down, you’ll see tracking permissions for individual apps too.
Lockdown Mode
Lockdown Mode is one of Apple’s newer features, released with iOS 16 and 17. This advanced security function changes how your iPhone operates to reduce the risk of threats and stop people from accessing information on your device. It stops or restricts the use of certain apps and websites, as well as features like SharePlay, Shared Albums, FaceTime Live Photos, and FaceTime Continuity Handoff. Your iPhone has to be unlocked to connect to any wired accessories such as chargers or USB ports.
Lockdown Mode aims to reduce spyware exploits. If you think you’ve been attacked by spyware, you can enable Lockdown Mode to severely limit where it can spread across your device and restrict the information it has access to. Although it’s primarily for people who could be personally targeted because of what they do, such as journalists, it might be necessary if you think your device is infected.
Malicious Website Protection
Safari is one of the most secure browsers. It has a built-in Fraudulent Website Warning to protect you from sites hiding malware. If you attempt to visit a suspicious website, the popup alerts you before the webpage opens to shield you from on-page vulnerabilities. It’s not turned on by default, but you can easily switch it on in your settings.
Safari also protects you from cross-site tracking and hides your IP address from trackers to stop them from digitally profiling you. This restricts third-party trackers from tracing information back to your iPhone, such as browsing history and your location. This type of information can easily be sold to other third parties or even used to target you with attacks. The less information you give away, the less there is for a cybercriminal to exploit.
Third-Party Security Support
There might be fewer apps on the App Store than on the Google Play Store, but not all is lost. Apple supports plenty of third-party security apps, including iOS VPNs. You can download Apple-approved VPNs to encrypt your device activity and mask your online habits. A VPN also changes your IP address, so cybercriminals and other online spies can’t see your iPhone location.
If you’re looking for an iOS VPN, you can download Private Internet Access from the App Store. PIA VPN encrypts your iPhone traffic, stopping third parties from spying on your activity, including your browsing history, online searches, and personal details. It’s harder for cybercriminals to target you or steal your data because they can’t see what you’re sharing online. You also get unlimited simultaneous connections, so you can protect all of your Apple devices at once.
How to Increase Your iPhone Security
It’s important to practice strong cyber hygiene to maintain your online security. Alongside your iPhone’s built-in features, we recommend these key steps for protecting your information:
- Install updates: Keep your iPhone and apps up to date. New updates aren’t just for cool features – they often have important security patches to remove potential vulnerabilities from your device.
- Use strong passwords: Apple’s iCloud Keychain is a great solution for keeping your passwords secure, but a weak password is still at risk of being compromised. Consider taking your iPhone’s suggestions of strong passwords, or use combinations and words that you know aren’t easy to guess.
- Use antivirus software: Install antivirus software to detect potential vulnerabilities, including malware and suspicious sites.
- Use a VPN: Download a VPN to conceal your online activities from prying eyes and stop cybercriminals from stealing your information. A VPN can also protect you from online trackers, preventing them from logging your internet history and private data.
- Be mindful online: Think twice about what you share online. Although it might feel important to tell Facebook you’ve just checked into a fancy hotel, revealing your whereabouts is risky. Be mindful of sharing details like your location, address, email address, and contact details. Cybercriminals can use this information to target you with phishing emails or steal your information for fraudulent purposes.
Why not try PIA VPN to increase your iPhone security? Our VPN blocks ads and harmful trackers to keep you safe from cross-site spies, risky websites, and unwanted data logging. You also get strong encryption to conceal your iPhone traffic, plus the option to upgrade and include advanced antivirus protection in your subscription.
iPhone Security: The Final Decision
So what’s the verdict? iPhones aren’t 100% safe, although they’re definitely one of the safer mobile options. Apple takes your security seriously and offers numerous features to keep you safe from malware, data leaks, and cybercriminal attacks. That said, it’s impossible to keep your information completely safe, even with all the latest security features. The best option? A VPN.
A VPN can’t promise 100% safety either, but it’s the best way to secure your iPhone. PIA VPN encrypts your iPhone traffic, which makes it inaccessible to any outsiders, including cybercriminals. They can’t see what you’re doing online – and with nothing to see, they have nothing to steal. Use a VPN alongside your iPhone’s built-in features, including tracking blocking, limited location sharing, and safe browsing to keep yourself secure.
FAQ
Is iPhone really secure?
Apple has a strong reputation for its security. It has various built-in features to increase your online security, including malware protection, Passkeys, and customizable information-sharing choices for apps. Apple is also well known for its stringent controls on apps, only allowing pre-approved developers to upload apps onto the store. iPhones are still hackable, though. Risky links, OS security vulnerabilities, and trends like jailbreaking mean cybercriminals can still find loopholes to access your device.

Earlier this year, as Keith Wedeking began building a garage at his house in Cedar Falls, Iowa, he resolved to drink a rare beer upon completing the project. Instead of an imperial stout or lambic of great vintage, Wedeking had squirreled away four expired cans of Busch Light Apple, a flavored lager that was discontinued in 2022.
“They’re for special occasions,” says Wedeking, who works for a cabinet manufacturer. “I stockpiled it just so I would have it.”
Hoarding is familiar behavior in beverage alcohol, from loading car trunks with Tree House IPAs or stocking cellars with bourbon from W.L. Weller. Quality and scarcity, either real or manufactured, can usually explain the accumulation, often accompanied by not-so-humble brags on social media.
Busch Light Apple was neither rare nor expensive. Anheuser-Busch released the summer seasonal in 2020, and customers could stroll into a gas station or supermarket and snag a 30-pack for $22 or so. The fruity spinoff found a rabid fanbase that stopped at nothing to get cold cans in warm hands, starting a Facebook group to find the beer and “even chasing beer trucks to get a taste,” Krystyn Stowe, the head of marketing for Busch Family and Natural Family at Anheuser-Busch, writes in an email.
In summer of 2021, Busch Light Apple, a.k.a. Bapple, sold more than 1 million cases in less than nine weeks, leading Anheuser-Busch to release it nationwide the following year. The move “greatly expanded the beer’s fandom,” Stowe writes, as well as the disappointment when the beer was scrapped.
Forlorn fans tried to recreate Busch Light Apple, turning to homebrew clone recipes, mixing Busch with Redd’s Hard Apple, and even pouring Snapple Apple into a can of Keystone Light like some all-American riff on the Spaghett. Bars infused Busch Light with cinnamon and fresh apples. Someone even started a Change.org petition about turning Busch Light Apple into a year-round release.
“The happiness and memories that Busch Light Apple has made are unparalleled and waiting to have an impact on all of our lives once more,” reads the petition, which has been signed by more than 1,000 people.
Some people are just not ready to let go of the Bapple of their eyes.
Apple Becomes Busch’s First Flavor Extension
Releasing a flavored extension of a beloved brand is smart business in the beer industry. Consider Bud Light, sold in lime and orange, plus hard seltzers tasting of lemonade, sangria, and raspberry iced tea. Anehuser-Busch first produced Busch in 1955, when it was known as Busch Bavarian, and the brand adhered to its beer-flavored roots as it expanded with Light (1979), NA (1994), and the boozier Ice (1996).
In particular, Busch Light has been on a sales bender across the Midwest and South, becoming the top-selling beer in nine states, including Ohio, Kansas, and Iowa. “Our roots are grounded in America’s heartland,” Stowe writes of the brand’s outdoorsy ethos, leaning into collaborations with John Deere and camo cans suited for hunting season. (Pair that beer with official Busch camo gear!) Apples were an easy tip of the tractor hat to the brand’s fanbase.
Limited-edition drops are a well-trod tactic for generating product excitement. For the Busch Light Apple release, “Busch Guy” (actor Gerald Downey) parodied Steve Jobs in an Apple-like unveiling event, touting the beer’s “universal taste compatibility.”
If I were a bettor, I would’ve laid bucks on odds that Busch Light Apple would last one year, tops. But the product quickly found a following, especially among folks who might not gravitate to Busch Light.
Nate Ethen, who lives about one hour north of Minneapolis, usually favored mixed drinks. “I’m not snobby about beer, but I just didn’t like the flavor of a lot of them,” says Ethen, who runs a group home for people with mental and physical disabilities. Busch Light Apple, though, with its fruity, not-too-sugary flavor, appealed to Ethen, who brought it to BBQs and social gatherings. “I liked having it on hand,” he says.
Busch Light Apple’s bulk size and relatively low cost also made it an easy sell. Unlike more expensive flavored malt beverages, or craft beer, “the taste at that price point was unbelievable,” says Dominick Rossi, who reviews “trash” beer on Instagram and first tried Busch Light Apple in 2021. “It tasted like straight apple cider that wasn’t too sweet.”
Drinkers could also crush lots and lots of Busch Light Apple. While in college, Rossi played 78 Cup, an especially destructive version of beer pong with 78 cups on each side, with Busch Light Apple. “Typically halfway through a 78 game, people start complaining about the taste of whatever cheap beer is in the cups,” Rossi says. “Those might have been the only 78 games I’ve ever played where people wanted to drink full beers.”
Discontinuation Leads to Stockpiling
The beer business is simple at its core. If a brand’s sales accelerate, a brewery should produce more beer to meet demand. Busch Light Apple sold five times the volume in its third year of production versus its first year, but Anheuser-Busch still composted the beer. “All good things must come to an end, so we were happy to go out on a high note,” Stowe writes.
“I saw people looking for it everywhere. I just thought, ‘Well, if there’s someone out there who really wants some, I can lighten my load a little bit.’”
Big Bapple fans filled their cars, trucks, vans, and Christmas trees with 30-packs, sometimes as many as 42, nursing their steadily dwindling and aging stock. (Behold, a refined tasting of vintage Busch Light Apple.)
“I was shocked,” Ethen says. He’d purchased about 14 cases, which was easy enough. But what does one do with all that apple beer? At the time, Ethen had a spare bedroom with no bed frame, so “I started stacking them up and basically made a bed frame out of the cases,” he says. “And that worked until I started diving into the stash and then, obviously, got a real bed frame.”
The market for expired fruit lager is more robust than you might imagine. Peruse Reddit and you’ll find desperate Busch Light Apple drinkers looking for their fruity fix. “I’m willing to go to whatever extremes have to be done,” one person wrote.
A Des Moines, Iowa, commenter recently tried finding Busch Light Apple as a Valentine’s Day gift for her boyfriend. “I know it’s discontinued, so [I] will pay whatever the market price is,” mentallyexhausted01 wrote, adding that she “can drive hours if needed.” (Perhaps a Busch Guy-officiated wedding is in their future.)
“The Peach was too sugary, and you could taste the artificialness that just wasn’t there with Bapple.”
Earlier this year, after a health scare led Ethen to drink less, he decided to sell two cases for $60 apiece. “I saw people looking for it everywhere,” he says. “I just thought, ‘Well, if there’s someone out there who really wants some, I can lighten my load a little bit.’”
On the Busch Light Apple Facebook group, he found someone who wanted Bapple for his chili recipe. The other buyer wanted to drink the beer. “He was like, ‘I just love this s*it. I’m probably going to drink half of it tonight,’” Ethen says.
Selling the Bapple left Ethen with mixed emotions. After saving the beer for the better part of two years, “it was sort of melancholy letting it go,” he says.
Anheuser-Busch has no current plans to revive Busch Light Apple, which was more or less a proof of concept. “Busch Light Apple helped pave the way for Busch Light Peach,” Stowe wrote of the replacement, which debuted in 2023.
In its first year, sales of Busch Light Peach (might we suggest a “Beach” nickname instead of “Bleach”) outperformed Apple, leading Anheuser-Busch to take the brand national this summer with accompanying TV commercials. Not every Bapple fan is on board.
“The Peach was too sugary, and you could taste the artificialness that just wasn’t there with Bapple,” Rossi says.
Iowa’s Wedeking bought two 30-packs when they were on sale, but “I wish I would have bought two cans,” he says. “It tasted like you put a peach Jolly Rancher in a Busch Light.”
Wedeking isn’t looking to fill the apple-shaped void in his beer fridge. There’s no Sisyphean mission to find replacements, a task that will grow tougher with each ensuing recycling day. Outside of the rare Blue Moon, he’s back to stocking his fridge with plenty of Rolling Rock and Busch Light.
But first, there’s a celebratory beer to drink. “The painters finished [the garage] last week, so I’ve been meaning to sit out there and drink a Busch Light Apple,” he says.",https://vinepair.com/articles/bring-back-busch-light-apple/

The option, which it says will be made available to qualifying developers “later this spring,” is being offered in response to the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which puts obligations on how Apple can operate the App Store and iOS, which are designated as “core platform services” under the law.
“Web Distribution, available in a software update later this spring, will let authorized developers distribute their iOS apps to EU users directly from a website the developer owns and operates,” it writes. “Apple will provide access to APIs that facilitate the distribution of developers’ apps from the web, integrate with system functionality, back up and restore users’ apps, and more.”
Apps offered through Apple’s Web Distribution APIs will have to meet Notarization requirements it previously set out — which it says is necessary to “protect platform integrity.” They can also only be installed from a website domain the developer has registered with Apple, in App Store Connect.
Users of iOS will also need to approve the developer installing apps from their site via their iPhone settings. They will see a “system sheet” — with info developers must submit to Apple for review, including the app name, developer name, app description, screenshots and system age rating.
Apple’s initial proposal for DMA compliance did not allow web-based distribution for apps. However, it has faced a barrage of outrage from developers decrying a narrow and self-serving interpretation of rules that the bloc’s lawmakers intend to open up digital markets locked down by the market power of a handful of intermediating internet “gatekeepers.”
The European Commission has also signaled it’s closely watching Apple. It’s notable that a few days after terminating the developer account of one of its most trenchant developer critics, Epic Games, Apple backed down and reinstated the account.

Apple made a handful of other changes to its DMA compliance offer last week — reducing certain criteria it had said it would apply to developers seeking to take up DMA entitlements. But today’s announcements look more substantial, with Apple also dropping a restriction on alternative app marketplaces that had meant they had to offer a catalog of other developers’ apps.
Now — effective immediately — Apple says alternative app marketplaces can choose to offer only their own apps.
In another change Apple has announced today — that’s also effective immediately — it’s dropping a requirement for developers that want to direct users to their own websites to purchase digital goods to use its own design templates for linking out to the web for purchases.
It says this template is now optional and developers can choose how to design in-app promotions, discounts and other deals when directing users to complete a transaction on their own website.
In a note to developers about the changes, Apple writes: “We’re providing more flexibility for developers who distribute apps in the European Union (EU), including introducing a new way to distribute apps directly from a developer’s website.”
The changes require developers to accept Apple’s new terms — which means signing up for a revised fee structure that includes a “core technology” fee, charged at €0.50 for each first annual install over 1 million in the past 12 months (regardless of where apps are distributed).
Apple argues this fee reflects the value it provides developers, via “ongoing investments in the tools, technologies, and services that enable them to build and share innovative apps with users around the world,” as it puts it.
Criteria for web distribution for iOS apps
Today’s changes mean qualifying iOS developers will soon be able to offer an alternative app store composed of their own wares and distributed from their own website — something Epic Games has been anticipating — but Apple is still applying some additional criteria, in addition to requiring developers to sign up to its new T&Cs (and pay the core tech fee).
As well as requiring developers to be incorporated, domiciled, and/or registered in the EU (or have a subsidiary legal entity incorporated, domiciled, and or registered in the EU that’s listed in App Store Connect), Apple’s criteria for eligibility for web distribution requires them to have been what it calls “a member of good standing” in its developer program for two continuous years or more and to have an app that had more than 1 million first annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.
It also stipulates developers must agree to a range of behavioral pledges, including committing to being responsive to communications from it, especially regarding “any fraudulent, malicious, or illegal behavior, or anything else that Apple believes impacts the safety, security, or privacy of users”; publishing transparent data collection policies and offering users control over how their data is collected and used; following applicable laws of the jurisdictions where they operate (Apple gives the examples of the EU’s Digital Services Act [DSA], General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR]), and consumer protection laws); and being responsible for handling governmental and other requests to take down listings of apps.
Apple’s explicit requirement that developers follow other EU laws looks particularly interesting in this context. The bloc’s lawmakers can’t exactly complain about that condition — so it offers a route for Apple to police developers’ access to web distribution for iOS apps by applying a privacy and consumer rights lens to third parties’ businesses.
Last year, reports suggested adtech giant Meta was planning to launch its own alternative app store on iOS and distribute apps to users in the EU via Facebook Ads, using the sideloading requirement in the DMA to bypass Apple’s App Store. And while Apple’s initial DMA compliance proposal looked too narrow to enable such a scenario, under the revised conditions Apple has announced today, Meta’s concept of iOS apps distributed via its own ad network looks possible.
However, there’s one — well, several — big potential sticking point: Meta’s compliance with the GDPR, DSA and EU consumer protection law are contested. Indeed, it’s been found to have breached the GDPR multiple times since the law started to apply back in 2018, incurring a series of fines and corrective orders since then. Meanwhile, its current attempt to force EU users to consent to tracking is being challenged via GDPR and consumer protection complaints. The EU is also asking questions about the mechanism’s compliance with the DSA, in addition to other areas of concern (like child safety).
Apple may therefore have plenty of grounds it can point to to deny web distribution to Meta — or, indeed, to any other business model that’s based on consentless surveillance of users and has a long history of run-ins with EU privacy laws.
Now the EU is asking questions about Meta’s ‘pay or be tracked’ consent model

Google Maps may soon be your default app on iOS — for some
Apple has improved Apple Maps frequently over the years. Considering how widely criticized the app was when it first launched, Apple has been successful in rehabilitating its web mapping and direction app for iOS. It may now even be some iPhone users' map app of choice.
However, Google Maps still reigns supreme in the category. Others prefer Waze, another navigation app from Google.
Unfortunately, for those iPhone users that never quite warmed up to Apple Maps, there hasn't been a way to change iOS' default Apple Maps app to an alternative — until now.
Changing the default navigation app in iOS 18?
Apple is finally going to let some iOS users change their default maps app from Apple Maps to one they might prefer such as Google Maps or Waze.
The news comes from a report that Apple released last week, which detailed how the company is preparing to comply with the EU's new Big Tech regulations known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA).
Apple makes mention of changes to the maps app default in a sentence first noticed by AndroidCentral.
""Apple also plans to introduce a new default control for users in Settings for navigation apps,"" reads the document. Apple says its working towards making this available by March 2025.
It's unclear whether Apple will roll out this feature to change the default maps app to all users. However, it's certainly going to be made available to EU users, as new laws require it.
Mashable previously reported on Apple's DMA compliance report, detailing some of the major upcoming changes to iOS and iPhone as a result of the DMA. However, we somehow overlooked this one-liner from Apple. And it's a fairly significant development.
Apple's timeframe for launching this feature appears to line up with it being released within a future update for iOS 18. The company will likely launch the beta version of the latest iOS in June for developers, followed by a public release in September.
iOS 17.4 was released earlier this month, so it seems plausible that EU users can look forward to changing their default maps app by iOS 18.4 next year.",https://mashable.com/article/ios-change-default-maps-app-ios-18-dma

We show you all the ways to find your Apple Watch phone number while on a T-Mobile plan, whether you have your Apple Watch on hand or not. If you're considering a change, the world of Android smartwatches has improved in recent years, with plenty of great options. These steps work for all Apple Watches, including the new Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch Series 9.
Why does the Apple Watch have two phone numbers?
If you have a new Apple Watch with GPS + Cellular and pay for cellular service through the T-Mobile network, the carrier provides a phone number separate from your iPhone. This number doesn't change how you receive phone calls or text messages. Incoming calls to your iPhone are still routed to your Apple Watch. This unique number, assigned with T-Mobile's DIGITS plan, is used for billing and technical support. You can't call or text with it. Apple Watches with GPS don't have a separate phone number. You'll need your paired iPhone's phone number to find this number.
The two phone numbers on an Apple Watch with GPS + Cellular are relevant for different purposes. If you need your phone number to contact someone or vice versa, you'll use your iPhone number. Having the Apple Watch's unique phone number is helpful when contacting T-Mobile customer support about your Apple Watch bill.

I took the MacBook Air M3 off the charger at around 3 p.m. on Friday. At 2.7 pounds, it’s light and compact enough to finish off the week’s work from the couch. Throughout the weekend, I dumped a bunch of raw files from a Canon R6 mirrorless camera to the MBA’s 512GB SSD. I watched a bunch of streamed episodes of Seinfeld on Netflix while I cleaned up around the house. I even used it to troubleshoot my parents’ Wi-Fi connection when they couldn’t get online. Before I knew it, Monday morning had arrived, and I still hadn’t plugged the MacBook Air back in. The battery indicator still said I had 21 percent of my juice left. This is how I want life with a laptop to go and I’m frankly not surprised that Apple’s latest ultra-portable delivers it. The 13-inch MacBook Air M3 is the predictable choice as the best laptop for most people, but it’s also the right choice, at least according to my experience so far.
What’s new in the 13-inch MacBook Air M3?
Apple switched up its MacBook Air design with the M2 generation, which debuted last year. It ditched the iconic (if a little dated) wedge-shaped design for a flatter form factor similar to the MacBook Pro computers. The M3 MacBook Air sticks to that new design, weighing in at 2.7 pounds and standing just 0.44 inches tall. In that slim strip, you get two USB-C (Thunderbolt 3) ports and a MagSafe 3 charging port on one side, and a 3.5mm headphone jack with high-impedance headphone support on the other. It’s 11.97 inches wide and 8.46 inches long and is available in Silver, Starlight, Space Gray, or Midnight (shown here). Ultimately, it feels like a MacBook Air, so no real surprises there.
Welcome Wi-Fi 6E
The upgrades are somewhat specific but useful for some people. The M3 now offers Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, an upgrade from the M2’s Wi-Fi 6. Of course, you’ll need a Wi-Fi 6E router in order to take any real advantage of any performance boost.
Better external monitor support
Close the MacBook Air’s lid, and it can fully support a pair of high-res monitors. The M2 model can only support a single external display. If you spend a lot of time sitting at a desk, which I unfortunately do, this might excite you. It’s slightly odd that the lid has to be closed, but it’s undeniably nicer to have two big matching external displays rather than one huge screen and the MBA’s tiny screen next to each other on the desk.
Performance upgrades
The real meat-and-potatoes upgrades come in the form of the computing hardware. This machine employs the Apple M3 chip, which promises a tangible speed upgrade compared to previous versions. Apple promises relatively modest overall performance upgrades for the CPU and GPU compared to the M2. Quick benchmarking tests suggest as much. We’re not publishing the benchmarks here; they’re simply meant to give us a reference. Plenty of great sites out there create controlled benchmark tests to help you ensure that you get the laptop that makes the biggest numbers on the testing graphs.
The new GPU architecture represents one of the bigger changes in overall performance. This is slightly conflicting for me because I’ll obviously always take the extra performance bump. Still, if you regularly play intensive games or do heavy creative work like video editing or music production, you’re almost certainly better off spending some extra money and upgrading to the MacBook Pro to get the extra performance enabled by the more robust cooling.
Which MacBook should you buy?
Since there are no real surprises here in terms of everyday usage, here are some common comparisons you’re likely to make if you’re shopping for a MacBook:
MacBook Air M2 vs. MacBook Air M3
If you’re already using an M2 MacBook Air, then you don’t really have much incentive to move up to the newest model. The Wi-Fi 6E is nice, and the performance upgrades aren’t totally intangible, but it’s rarely necessary to upgrade MacBooks with every generation. Run the M2 until it doesn’t do what you need, then move on to the next version. If your M2 is seriously lagging on you because you’re doing resource-intensive work, then you’re probably best served moving up to a MacBook Pro and skipping the Air series in general.
MacBook Air M1 vs. MacBook Air M3
This is a different story. The M1 MacBook Air is still a great little machine for most people, but it’s getting long in the tooth. Really think about whether you need the extra performance. We’ve seen the M1 machines go for $749 in recent months, which is a full $350 cheaper than the new M3 (when comparing base models). If your daily activities don’t get much more intense than email and web surfing, the M1 still may have plenty of power. That said, I like the M3 form factor much more, and that M3 chip will stay relevant for years longer than the M1 at this point.
MacBook Air M3 vs. MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch
It’s nice to think of yourself as a “pro,” but not everyone needs to spend the money jumping up to the MBP laptops series. The cheapest 14-inch MacBook Pro comes with a standard M3 chip and adds a full $500 to the base price. That’s a considerable jump, but it’s worth the extra cost if you’re regularly editing video, churning through huge photo files, or doing other greedy tasks. That extra cost also comes with a bigger, heavier machine, so be realistic about your needs. Editing the occasional Reel in Final Cut isn’t reason enough to splurge unless you really want it.
What MacBook Air M3 configuration should you buy?
While I’m a big fan of Apple silicon, I think it’s a slight miss for the company to set 8GB as the floor for shared memory. The move up to 16GB also comes with an extra 256GB of built-in storage (for a total of 512GB) and two extra GPU cores for a total price of $1,499. That’s $400 more than the base model, but it will keep your machine relevant and capable for longer (and save you from buying an external hard drive, at least for a bit). A well-treated MacBook Air can last five years or more. Those upgrades now will have a big impact on how well it ages. Remember, the M-series chips are basically fully enclosed so you can’t upgrade much later.
All of that said, the base M3 MacBook Air is likely just fine for most people right now. If you’re not planning on running this machine into the 2030s and primarily using your computer for school or business, you can save the upgrade money without feeling like you’re missing out on much.
So, who should buy the MacBook Air M3?
Like I said above, I really do believe the MacBook Air M3 is the best laptop for most people at the moment. It’s beautifully designed, very portable, and extremely quick at every task we tried. The base model does feel a smidge underpowered for the price, but we’re used to paying a little extra when it comes to Apple. Overall, this is one of the best laptops I’ve ever used. I assume I’ll be saying the same thing again this time next year when the M4 version comes out. That’s OK with me. I don’t really like surprises anyway.",https://www.popsci.com/gear/apple-macbook-air-m3-13-inch-2024-review/

Apple Music will roll out the playlist later this year in coordination with Getty’s 91st birthday in December. The playlist will be part of the world’s largest classical-music catalog on a streaming service, although it’s not yet clear which of Getty’s compositions made the cut.
Getty, the son of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, is worth an estimated $2.1 billion, according to Forbes. The outlet said he has given more than $200 million to his philanthropic arts foundation.
Getty has also composed music for four decades, winning the American Symphony Orchestra League’s Gold Baton in 2003. The Kennedy Center named him as an Outstanding American Composer in 1986, and the San Francisco Opera gave him the Spirit of the Opera award last year.
The Apple Music announcement was made earlier this month at Festival Napa Valley’s Angel of the Arts gala, where Getty received the “Angel of the Arts” award — the festival’s highest honor, given in celebration of outstanding contributions to the arts. Getty is one of the festival’s founding benefactors and has been a mainstay at the event for years.
Payam Mirrashidi, Apple’s vice president of engineering, told The Examiner that the collaboration with Getty has been in the works for some time to provide classical-music lovers and musicians the “optimal streaming experience that was missing from the scene.”
In 2021, Apple acquired Primephonic, a streaming service that Getty had previously invested in. Mirrashidi said that after the acquisition, the Apple team and Getty “began to get to know and appreciate each other.”
He said that the emotional immediacy and power of Getty’s music are at the forefront of the playlist. Many of the pieces have been recognized as having a strong element of a Bay Area vibe about them, he said.

Lisa Delan, director of Getty’s music company Rork Music, said the composer is delighted that the Apple Essentials Getty playlist is being launched in the year he turns 91, adding that it was “worth the wait.”
Rick Walker, Festival Napa Valley president and CEO, said in a release that it was an honor to pay tribute to Getty during his birthday year by bestowing the festival’s “Angel of the Arts” award on him.
“Gordon’s artistry and generosity have made a profound impact on audiences and art organizations across the globe,” Walker said in a statement.
“We are proud of our association with him as an artistic partner, supporter, vintner, and most of all, friend,” he said.
Since its launch in March 2022, one of Apple Music Classical‘s most popular features is its playlists, Mirrashidi said. Users have frequently said that they enjoy playlists dedicated to particular artists or themes.
The app also has placed a strong emphasis on editorial and curated content, the likes of which are being produced to honor Getty. Mirrashidi said the goal is to create a project that all classical fans can gravitate to in appreciation, whether a listener be an expert or a beginner looking for guidance.
The highlight throughout this endeavor for the team has been “being able to recognize and celebrate a living composer,” he said.",https://www.sfexaminer.com/culture/classical-music/gordon-getty-works-are-highlighted-by-apple-music-classical/article_99e346d0-e0bd-11ee-9cb8-1fe299afc7f3.html

- Apple offers a trade-in program for both Apple and some non-Apple devices.
- You can get an estimated value for your device and choose between store credit or an Apple Gift Card.
- You can mail your device or bring it to an Apple Store.
When you get yourself a new piece of tech, like the newest and best iPhone, the only thing you want to do for quite a while is simply play around with it. Checking out new features, getting to know the shiny, new device, there's scarcely anything better than that.
However, when the first excitement goes away, it's worth coming back to your previous phone, tablet or laptop. The question now is -- what should you do with it?
Get the gift of Apple? Here's how to use your gift card
You can use your Apple Gift card on your iPhone, Mac, iPad, in person or even on an Android phone. Here's how.
Fortunately, nowadays, many manufacturers and retailers offer trade-in programs that take care of the old device for you, and you get a nice discount on your new tech in the process -- that surely is a win-win situation. Among these programs, Apple's trade-in scheme is probably the most well-known, offering to take your Apple devices off your hands.
Especially now that the newest M3 MacBook Air has hit the shelves, it's a great time to trade in your well-worn laptop and get a nice discount on the new, shiny one. Here's everything you need to know about the Apple trade-in program.
What to do with your old tech?
Some people tend to chuck it in a drawer somewhere just in case, and some throw it away (remember to recycle your electronics if you do). Of course, you can also pass it on to a child or a friend.
You also have to remember that your older tech still has quite a lot of value left in it. Electronics do not age as quickly as they used to, and a two or three-year-old phone or a PC is still in its prime.
So you can also sell your older device and get some money back from it. Of course, selling it on your own is how to get the most money back, but some people don't have the time or patience to do it. If you're not into that, you can also opt for a trade-in program and exchange your older device for a discount on the new one.
How does Apple Trade-In work?
One of the most popular trade-in programs is offered by Apple. It works in an extremely straightforward way. When buying a new device on Apple's website, you can opt in to trade your current device for a new one. Interestingly, Apple offers trade-ins for Apple devices and even some manufactured by other producers (although their trade-in value is much lower than comparable Apple products, so keep that in mind).
Once you check that you want to trade in your device, you'll need to provide more info -- its serial number and the state of the device. Based on this preliminary info, Apple will provide you with the estimated value of your phone. If you agree to go along with the trade-in, you can also choose how to get that value -- either as a store credit for your new device or as an Apple Gift Card.
The rest of the trade-in process is really straightforward. With your new device, you'll receive instructions on getting your device ready for trade-in. You can either mail it in or bring it to the Apple Store. You'll need to log out of your iCloud account and back up your data, but you'll get an email with detailed instructions on how to do all that, if that sounds unfamiliar.
After bringing the device to the Apple Store or mailing it in, you'll have to wait around 2-3 weeks for your device to be examined and the final trade-in value to be confirmed. After another 3-5 days, you should get your credit or a gift card.
How often are Apple trade-in prices adjusted?
Of course, as technology progresses and Apple introduces new devices to the market, the trade-in values are also bound to change, along with the devices that are accepted into the program.
In general, you can expect trade-in values to change a few days or weeks after every major hardware announcement that Apple makes. That means, once a new Apple product drops, the company will probably soon change trade-in values to reflect the new product stack.
Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max vs iPhone 14 Pro Max: Actionable differences
The iPhone 15 Pro Max has more features compared to the 14 Pro Max, but is it worth the upgrade? Let's take a look.
Interestingly, that doesn't mean that all the prices are immediately going down. For example, the latest adjustment happened on 7 March 2024, and while a few items got their value lowered, some (such as the iPhone 14 Pro Max) got their value increased a little bit.
When it comes to dropping devices altogether, a good rule of thumb is: if Apple stops supporting the device with software updates, you can expect it to soon be dropped from the trade-in program as well. It might take a generation or two if the particular device was especially popular, but it's a good general rule to keep in mind.
What devices are eligible for a trade-in?
Apple's trade-in program is robust and offers credit for many devices. The no-brainers are that you can easily trade in your iPhones and Macs, the two main categories of products that Apple sells, but that's not all.
Other Apple products are eligible for trade-in. The two other big groups of devices that make the Apple ecosystem so robust are iPads and Apple Watches, which can be traded in. If you want to freshen up your ecosystem, you can get store credit for almost every part of it.
Remember that Apple allows you to trade in still-supported devices, which means they still get OS updates. If your device is already EoL, you won't be able to get any store credit for it.
Apple's working on a foldable iPhone? 4 things it must have for me to get one
There are plenty of reasons to buy a potential folding iPhone, but what does it really need to make it worth the likely steep price?
Products from Apple that cannot be traded in are mostly accessories, such as AirPods, Apple Pencils, AppleTV, or HomePod. With these, the only official way to go is to recycle them, so if you want to get some money out of your older Apple accessories, eBay or sites like that are the way to go.
Interestingly, Apple also allows you to trade in some Android devices, mostly from Google or Samsung. So, if you want to switch from Android to iOS, you can do that while getting some store credit to boot. However, remember that Android phones' values in Apple's trade-in program are quite low, and you can get much more when selling them elsewhere. Granted, it's also true for iPhones, but the discrepancy in price is much bigger for Android-powered devices.
It's also worth noting that even if your device is not eligible for a trade-in with Apple, the company offers free recycling for your electronics.
This might not be worth it if you have a device that Apple does not accept, as you can get some money out of it elsewhere. If you're making a switch from quite a venerable machine, this might be the easiest and most hands-off recycling process available.
Which Apple devices are worth the most when trading in?
When trading in your Apple devices, their value depends on a few factors. The most obvious one is their age. Generally, the older the device, the less valuable it is. However, some additional factors impact their price:
- Specific model -- iPhone 14 Pro Max will generally be more valuable than iPhone 14, even though they were released at the same time.
- Storage -- iPhone 14 with 512GB of storage will be worth more than the same phone in the same condition with 128GB of storage.
- Specifications -- this applies mostly to Macs. There are many variants of CPUs, GPUs, and RAM available, and each of these will impact the trade-in price.
- Condition -- this mostly applies to your iPhones, as cracked or significantly scratched screens will fetch a much lower price than phones in pristine condition, but this also applies to all other devices to some degree as well.

Luxshare Precision Industry, a key Apple supplier, is repositioning itself as a solutions provider instead of a contract manufacturer for big brands, according to its chairwoman.
Wang Laichun, the 57-year-old low profile founder and chairwoman of Luxshare, said in an interview on the sidelines of China’s annual legislative gathering that the business of contract manufacturing – assembling products in accordance with customer requests – “does not have a soul”, indicating her desire to move away from low value-added processing.

Lawrence “Larry” David Simmons, Sr. (83) beloved husband, father, grandfather, and brother was peacefully called to be with his heavenly Father on Monday, March 11th, surrounded by his loving family at his side.
Larry was born in Chicago, Illinois, on August 10, 1940, to Ida Mae Wesley Simmons Young and Samuel Simmons. He moved to Minneapolis when he was 4 years old and attended Clinton Glen Elementary School, Franklin, and Bryant Junior High, graduating from the historic Central High School (South Minneapolis) in 1958. He spoke lovingly of his childhood. Enjoying speed skating at Powderhorn Park, hanging out at his stepfather's and uncle's historic Young Brother's barbershops, dancing at the Phyllis Wheatley house, and keeping up with his older siblings. His family was actively involved in community service work and their faith home, St. Peter's AME. His loving family and tight community were pillars throughout his life. Following the example of his older brothers, Lawrence enlisted in the Navy. After his service, he finished his education, graduating from the University of Minnesota, earning a degree in economics and philosophy. His passion for those subjects was lifelong.
He began his long career in technology management, starting at Control Data, where he developed a reputation for staff development and mentoring. This reputation stayed with him throughout his career. He continued to mentor young professionals in retirement, always with his door open to lend an ear or offer advice. After Control Data, Lawrence thrived working in Governor Perpich’s administration as the Assistant Commissioner for Technology and Training. He was a pioneer, providing citizens with access to technology training and jobs. He left the governor’s administration to take on a new challenge to strengthen and lead the development and growth of the state’s Opportunity Industrialization Centers (OICs).
His leadership of the state's OIC programs was highly regarded. In 1988, he earned Governor Perpich’s highest honor, the Key of the State Award, for his work towards “growing and developing employment opportunities for the economically disadvantaged."" He continued to support the OIC organization as a board member and volunteer long past his tenure. He was selected to lead the technology systems at the Minnesota State College and University System (MnSCU) as the Director of Technology, his last role before retirement. During his tenure at MnSCU, his work included overseeing the Y2K project and the development of the university's statewide web. Larry would say the most rewarding part of his work was the training and development of his team. His commitment to the state leaves a lasting legacy, contributing to improving the quality of life for Minnesotans.
He was steadfast in supporting and encouraging his children, unselfishly providing for his family without worrying about himself. He instilled in his children the importance of education, and hard work, and he made sure they had opportunities to develop a range of hobbies and interests. This spirit to embrace learning and opportunities can now be seen in his grandchildren, and he took great pride in supporting and attending their many activities.
His passion for music was a constant throughout his life, especially for jazz and the blues. He embraced his love of music during retirement, taking up piano and voice lessons. He was an active member of the Church of the Risen Savior, celebrating mass and enjoying the choir and study groups. He found lifelong friendships in his men’s prayer group.
Larry was a storyteller and was happiest surrounded by his family and friends, sharing stories, demonstrating his card shark abilities, and playing music games. He had lifelong friends and was known to stop everything to take calls with friends from far and wide. He could often be found beautifying his yard with his wife, Ginny, a passion he inherited from his mom. Larry found time to travel in retirement, taking road trips and seeing new parts of the country.
He is survived by his loving wife, Virginia ""Ginny,"" and former wife, Myrtis Ingram and their children, sons David (Linda) and Daniel Scott. Daughters, Kym (Daniel), Maria, Gina, and Kristina. Grandchildren, Patrick, Matthew, James, Olivia, Brianna, Christopher, and Benjamin. And an extended stepfamily.
Larry was the youngest of five siblings; he is survived by his sister, Dr. Lorraine Taylor, his brother Wesley Simmons (Donna), and many nieces, nephews, and friends. He was preceded in death by his father Samuel Simmons, mother Ida Mae Wesley Young, stepfather John Young, and brothers Samuel Simmons Sr. and Kenneth Simmons.
Larry’s strength, support, and unconditional love will be greatly missed.
A celebration of life will take place at 11 a.m. on Thursday, March 21, 2024, at the Church of the Risen Savior (1501 East CR 42) in Burnsville. Visitation is from 10 to 11 a.m. prior to the service. Interment: Fort Snelling.

Apple is enlarging its applied research operations in mainland China, as the US technology giant’s iPhone sales slow in the world’s largest smartphone market amid increased competition from Huawei Technologies and other major domestic handset vendors.
Cupertino, California-based Apple plans to expand its research centre in Shanghai to support all of its product lines and open a new lab in southern tech hub Shenzhen later this year, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.
The Shenzhen lab is expected to boost Apple’s testing and research capabilities for its major products including the iPhone, iPad and Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, according to the company. The new facility will also serve to strengthen the firm’s collaboration with local suppliers, while providing support to all its employees in the region. The mainland forms part of Apple’s Greater China region, which also covers Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.

Apple’s vice-president and managing director of Greater China, Isabel Ge Mahe, said in the statement that the company is “proud” to cultivate deeper ties in China and expand its facilities in the country.
“We have already invested 1 billion yuan (US$139.2 million) into [the existing] applied research lab in China,” she told China Daily in a report published on Tuesday.

As a recap, Apple was found to be infringing on patented pulse oximetry technology owned by Masimo, and was banned from importing the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 into the U.S.
The original January 12 order from CBP that allowed Apple to bring Apple Watch models with a disabled sensor in the United States was published recently (via ip fray), and it gives some insight into how Apple disabled pulse oximetry. While some of the order is redacted, Apple implemented a fix that turns off pulse oximetry when an Apple Watch is paired to an iPhone. Blood oxygen sensing becomes inaccessible to the user, and opening the blood oxygen app gives a warning that the feature is not available. Apple said that it hardcoded each Apple Watch at the factory with new software.
As part of the process to get approval to sell Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 models without pulse oximetry enabled, Apple had to provide the code disabling the feature and test devices to Masimo. Masimo didn't want Apple to have such an easy fix, so it paired the ""redesigned"" Apple Watches with a jailbroken iPhone running an older version of iOS, and was able to get pulse oximetry working.
Masimo tried to argue that activating pulse oximetry through a jailbroken phone meant Apple had not effectively removed the feature and the devices should not be allowed to be imported in to the U.S. Masimo also tried to say that jailbreaking is ""permissible, common, and readily known,"" but Masimo's arguments were unsuccessful. The Exclusion Order Enforcement Branch of the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol ultimately decided that disabling pulse oximetry in the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 was enough to avoid infringing on Masimo patents, allowing those models to be offered for sale at Apple retail stores in the U.S.
Because Masimo was able to get blood oxygen sensing working using software on a jailbroken iPhone, Apple too would be able to reactivate the blood oxygen sensor in the models where it has been disabled through a software update. When no longer subject to an import ban, Apple will be able to reintroduce blood oxygen sensing for Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 users who are not able to access the feature.
As noted by ip fray, the patents that Apple was found to have infringed on expire in August of 2028, which means that Apple will be able to re-enable pulse oximetry in affected models at that time. Apple filed an appeal with the United States International Trade Commission to attempt to get the ruling overturned, so if the appeal is successful, Apple could be able to re-add blood oxygen sensing sooner.
Apple could also opt to settle with Masimo and work out a licensing deal, but at this point, it doesn't sound like that is going to happen. Masimo CEO Joe Kiani said in January that he had not spoken with Apple, and while he would be open to settling, an apology and an ""honest dialogue"" would need to be part of any settlement discussion.
Kiani has maligned the Apple Watch blood oxygen sensor several times, saying that customers are ""better off without"" the feature because it is not a ""reliable, medical pulse oximeter.""
The Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 only have disabled blood oxygen sensing capabilities in the United States, as the ban is not applicable in other countries. The Apple Watches remain fully functional outside of the U.S.",https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/

Marketed as a “spatial computer,” the Vision Pro is designed to integrate all of your productivity, entertainment and computing needs into a single visual interface, with various hand gestures allowing users to interact with the device’s many features. Unfortunately, the technical pros of the Vision Pro are heavily undermined by its hefty price tag of $3,500. Nevertheless, Apple rapidly sold out its initial stock to 200,000 eager buyers. However, millions of consumers were less convinced to fork over half of the world’s average monthly wage for a headset.
In addition to its lofty price tag, the “spatial computer” is designed to seamlessly integrate with other products in Apple’s ecosystem — and only products in the Apple ecosystem. Assuming you don’t already have a Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch or all of the above, unlocking the Vision Pro’s full potential could cost you a small fortune.
Aside from the astronomical cost, if implemented into our work and learning spaces, the Vision Pro has the potential to revamp productivity by freeing users from an unnecessarily cluttered and restrictive physical desktop, allowing them to work from anywhere at their larger, more efficient digital workbench. By acting as an interface that can both augment and supplement reality, the Vision Pro also carries great benefits for professionals whose job is still predominantly rooted in reality. Surgeons can use the Vision Pro as an educational tool to refine and guide their conduct in the operating room and architects can use advanced 3D modeling software to refine their design process.
In this sense, the Apple Vision Pro goes beyond the gaming-oriented setups that defined such devices in the 2010s. The Meta Quest 2 is a competitor of the Vision Pro and the latest in a long line of such gaming-oriented products, with two-thirds of all apps on its store categorized under gaming. The Vision Pro isn’t limited to just gaming — it is a platform that caters to your every computing need, regardless of your profession.
On the other hand, by blending AR and VR into one platform, the Vision Pro is also very useful for life at home. It allows users to use multiple screens, present on video calls, watch TV, create shopping lists and read the latest news from The Michigan Daily in the blink of an eye — all in the same virtual interface. In the field of education, the device can completely shift the way students engage with material in the classroom. With the Vision Pro, Apple has the opportunity to capitalize on VR’s shortsightedness and carve out its niche in enhancing productivity in a way we have never seen before.
Although this sounds highly innovative, the Vision Pro will also ensure that our society becomes even more disconnected from reality than ever before. Given how far Apple’s first iteration of a headset has advanced the field, it is highly likely that future iterations of the Vision Pro could become just as ubiquitous as the iPhone and other such devices have become over the last decade. In its first iteration, the iPhone, too, was considered overpriced and overhyped — a novelty that would only interest the most tech-obsessed individuals and wouldn’t have a significant impact on our culture.
Despite this, Apple committed to the potential of the iPhone and in future iterations created one of the most revolutionary tech products the world has ever seen. Initial reviews of the Vision Pro have been similar. Yet if Apple continues to commit to its vision and releases further iterations of its flagship headset, the negative consequences of the iPhone’s innovation — becoming addicted, apathetic and distracted — will manifest themselves to an even greater extent in a product as all consuming as the Vision Pro.
With the iPhone, iPad and Mac, we have already seen the consequences of dramatic innovation — both the good and the bad. Undeniably, the Vision Pro holds an unparalleled potential to boost our productivity by integrating all of the functions of each individual tech device we own into one “spatial computer.” But it forces us to synchronize the digital world even more with our daily lives, and to a far greater extent than the iPhone or any other tech product was capable of doing. Furthermore, Apple’s marketing team seems hellbent on convincing consumers to wear the headset constantly throughout the day, an experience which would inexorably make fully disconnecting from technology an increasingly distant memory.
Even from a standpoint of enhancing productivity in the workplace, the Vision Pro’s innovations in secularizing your physical workspace into one digital platform may be strongly outweighed by the mental and physical health consequences of constantly wearing a cubicle around your head. The physical cubicle, an invention of a prior century which dominated office workspaces, was notorious for isolating professionals and making their work lives a living nightmare, with none of the intended positives of sheltering workers in their little box of illusory privacy.
While workers of physical cubicles could return home with the peace of mind that their cubicle would stay behind, the Vision Pro ensures that your cubicle is now digitally manifested in $3,500 goggles attached to your head. In such conditions, separating work from life becomes almost impossible. While you may be unprecedentedly productive in theory, the stress of your literal headspace being dominated by the needs and action items for your bosses or professors is an extremely dystopian thought that is highly unlikely to improve the declining mental health of workers.
Privacy concerns are also a major component of the cons surrounding the Vision Pro. Tech giants such as Google and Meta are already well known for harvesting extraordinary volumes of data from its users to generate massive advertising revenues. To achieve this, our conversations, health metrics, searches, pictures, followings, interests, devices on our local network and every other way in which we interact with technology are used to generate an advertising profile and sold to the highest bidder. If users wear the Vision Pro at all times — as Apple marketing hopes they do — they’d be giving Apple unprecedented access to every waking moment of their lives: an unavoidable, extreme invasion of personal privacy that users cannot opt out of if they want to use the device.
Innovation is never a totally positive phenomenon. In the case of the Pro, the cons significantly outweigh its positive innovations. The Vision Pro is poised to blur the line between work-life balance, make us even more addicted to technology and further disconnect us from reality and personal relationships. The potential of unprecedented productivity may be just as catastrophically unrealized as it was for the cubicle and usher in a new era of dystopia.

The second-gen iPad, which came out in 2011, was the first model with cameras. This included a front-facing camera, positioned on one of the short edges so it sat at the top when holding the device in portrait orientation. Perfect for selfies, but less ideal for video chats where the iPad is more commonly positioned in landscape mode.
It took a while, but eventually, Apple realized that for some customers, maybe even most customers (after all, who spends their time taking selfies with an iPad?!), it might make more sense to position the front camera in one of the long edges. This realization resulted in the launch of the reconfigured 10th-gen iPad in October 2022.
The 6th-gen iPad Pro models which came out at the same time did not, however, get the new camera layout, even though they cost more and normally get the desirable new features and design changes before the standard models. The most likely explanation is that the Pros (like the Air) have connectors for the Apple Pencil in the most suitable long edge, so it would have been a more difficult redesign for them.
Apple hasn’t released any new iPads since then, so it’s been difficult to assess how the company felt about the success of the landscape camera design, or whether it planned to release more devices along the same lines. But our long iPad drought should soon be coming to an end. New iPad Air and (OLED-equipped) iPad Pro models are expected to arrive this spring, and new evidence supports the theory that they will all get the 2022 landscape camera layout.
A Weibo leaker named Instant Digital (as reported by MacRumors), claims that the 10.9- and new 12.9-inch versions of the 6th-gen iPad Air will have their selfie camera on the long edge. Added to the discovery earlier this year of code suggesting the same change is coming to the iPad Pro, it now looks like we’re going to get the full set of properly aligned cameras.
Of course, we won’t know until the tablets are actually announced. (You can keep up with the latest news and rumors with our new iPad Pro and new iPad Air superguides.) But it would certainly make sense, and correct an error that Apple customers have been living with for 13 years.",https://www.macworld.com/article/2262063/2024-ipad-air-pro-camera-landscape-orientation.html

The new web distribution feature will be available with a software update “later this spring,” according to Apple, providing developers with a key new way to distribute iOS apps in EU markets without the need for a separate app store — as long as they’re willing to adhere to Apple’s strict rules.
Apple to allow iOS app downloads direct from websites in the EU
Developers will need to adhere to some strict rules from Apple, though.
Developers will need to adhere to some strict rules from Apple, though.
While Apple is opening up iOS to more third-party apps here, these are still some key security protections around how apps are distributed via websites — namely, you’ll still have to work within the strict Apple app development ecosystem. “Apps offered through Web Distribution must meet Notarization requirements to protect platform integrity, like all iOS apps, and can only be installed from a website domain that the developer has registered in App Store Connect,” explains Apple.
It’s also not going to be a simple process to install these apps on an iPhone in the EU. “To install apps from a developer’s website, users will first need to approve the developer to install apps in Settings on their iPhone,” says Apple. “When installing an app, a system sheet will display information that developers have submitted to Apple for review, like the app name, developer name, app description, screenshots, and system age rating.”
So this isn’t going to be an open and free way for developers to distribute apps over the web to iOS devices in EU markets. “Apple will authorize developers after meeting specific criteria and committing to ongoing requirements that help protect users,” says Apple. Developers will need to be part of Apple’s Developer Program and be registered in the EU. They’ll also need to agree to a number of key undertakings, as outlined by Apple:
- Be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an organization incorporated, domiciled, and or registered in the EU (or have a subsidiary legal entity incorporated, domiciled, and or registered in the EU that’s listed in App Store Connect). The location associated with your legal entity is listed in your Apple Developer account.
- Be a member of good standing in the Apple Developer Program for two continuous years or more, and have an app that had more than one million first annual installs on iOS in the EU in the prior calendar year.
- Only offer apps from your developer account.
- Be responsive to communications from Apple regarding your apps distributed through Web Distribution, particularly regarding any fraudulent, malicious, or illegal behavior, or anything else that Apple believes impacts the safety, security, or privacy of users.
- Publish transparent data collection policies and offer users control over how their data is collected and used.
- Follow applicable laws of the jurisdictions where you operate (for example, the Digital Services Act, the General Data Protection Regulation, and consumer protection laws).
- Be responsible for handling governmental and other requests to take down listings of apps
That’s a lot of hoops for developers to jump through, and it appears that Apple is limiting this to big developers only thanks to the 1 million installs requirement. Having a good standing developer account for two years may also rule Epic Games out of this particular distribution method. Epic Games is still hoping to launch its iOS game store in the European Union soon, though.
Apple currently allows developers to distribute their apps on third-party marketplaces in EU countries, but if those apps reach more than 1 million annual installs per year, they’ll need to pay that 50 euro cent fee for every additional installation and update. That same Core Technology Fee process is part of web distribution of iOS apps, too. Only nonprofit organizations, select educational institutions, and government entities in the EU are exempt from this Core Technology Fee.
Still, the ability for developers to bring their apps directly to iPhone users in the EU without having to go through the App Store or another third-party store will be useful for some willing to put up with the tight restrictions. There’s some obvious friction for end users, but with some third-party stores requiring fees, this allows iOS developers to avoid stores altogether if they’re willing to host their apps directly and abide by Apple’s rules and policies.
Apple is also changing its strict rules around how developers link to an external webpage to complete purchases for digital goods. Developers can now “choose how to design promotions, discounts, and other deals,” according to Apple. That means Apple’s own design templates are optional, instead of being forced on developers.

- The Dual Solo Knit Band Approach provided me with better support and comfort for the Vision Pro headset.
- Using two Solo Knit Bands can relieve pressure on the forehead and cheekbones, allowing for longer use.
- Consider other mods like a generic CPAP top strap or different cushions for increased comfort.
It was a little disappointing to find out that Apple's Vision Pro didn't quite fit me as well as I would have liked. I found the headset uncomfortable enough that I decided to mod it by adding a second band using plastic pieces to improve the fit and feel. Here's how.
Try the Dual Solo Knit Band Approach
Out of the box, Apple offers two head straps, a Solo Knit Band, and a Dual Loop Band. These options should work for a lot of people, but since everyone’s face and head are different, they won’t work for everyone. They haven’t completely worked for me.
I like the Solo Knit Band’s soft fabric and easy-to-turn dial, but the headset puts a lot of pressure on my forehead while using it. I can only wear it for about 30 minutes at a time. The Dual Loop Band adds a top strap and I can use that option for much longer, though my cheekbones feel it more when I’m done.
One modification option is to buy a second Solo Knit Band and use two of them at the same time. This allows for good support for the back, without needing to make it super tight to carry all the weight.
Several people have 3D-printed clips for a second Solo Knit Band to attach to, though in a pinch you could use zip ties to secure a second band from Apple. I tried the SoloTop clips to attach the second band because it had a lot of comments about its printing quality being good. After trying it, I agree. Even though it’s a homemade print, it felt much more polished than others.
Using two Solo Knit Bands helped relieve pressure on my forehead and cheekbones so I no longer have as much problem wearing the headset for extended periods. (Though the battery may still limit use to around 2.5 hours.)
Other Vision Pro Mods
I was mentally prepared to try a dozen other mods to get the headset as comfortable as possible, but I didn’t need to. If you're curious or searching for another option, Reddit is littered with ideas. I haven’t tried these and don’t know whether they’ll work, but they are at least interesting enough to consider.
One of the cheapest options is to try using a generic CPAP top strap with a Solo Knit Band to help distribute the weight across your head more. It’s not the most elegant solution as it has the possibility of blocking the speakers, but it’s a cheaper way to get an idea if altering the default strap will increase your comfort level. Likely because of its low cost, it has been a popular option.
There are other attempts to make the Vision Pro headbands more like the Meta Quest, like a Comfort Module from VRPANDA. There’s also the Comfytop one that makes the top strap vertical on your head instead of horizontal. Even though the images are intriguing, its implementation seems a little dubious—be wary.
People have tried doing new cushions for their light seals. People have tried doubling up on the cushions and removing the light seal. At least one person has cut their cushion to keep it from resting on their cheeks. There are plenty of combinations of things to try.
How to Get Even More Comfortable in the Vision Pro
If you are feeling discomfort be sure to check with Apple about the fit of your light seal.
The first thing I tried to increase the Vision Pro’s comfort was to visit an Apple Store and get my light seal adjusted. I tried the headset on in the store when I picked it up, but that fitting only lasted five to 10 minutes. Plus, the headset was new and I was busy marveling at what was inside the goggles.
I brought my current light seal and tried on different ones in the store. I ended up switching it to a different size. That didn’t fix my problem completely which is why I went searching for other options.
Another thing to try is using the different cushions with the different bands. Inside the Vision Pro box, there are two cushions, one labeled W and the other W+. I found using the thicker and thinner ones with different straps also made the headset feel different. Try mixing and matching them.
I don't doubt that more third-party ones will begin to appear soon. I also hope Apple adds a few other first-party options. It would be silly for them not to profit off the fit of their own headset. Until then, however, you can always take matters into your own hands.",https://www.howtogeek.com/apple-vision-pro-uncomfortable-you-should-mod-it/

Novo Nordisk expects amycretin and cagrisema to have the same cardiovascular benefits as Wegovy.
It is likely that Novo Nordisk will have brought weight-loss drug amycretin in pill form to the market by 2030, Head of Development Martin Holst Lange says in an interview with the news agency Reuters.
”I never commit to timelines, but I would feel comfortable saying that it will at least be within this decade,” he says.
On Thursday, Novo Nordisk announced data from a Phase I study of amycretin in pill form showing a 13.1% weight loss over 12 weeks.
This sent the Novo Nordisk share price soaring by more than 8%.
Lange also told Reuters that it is a ”likely scenario” that both amycretin and cagrisema have the same cardiovascular benefits as Wegovy.
On August 8, 2023, Novo Nordisk published data from a study showing that Wegovy could reduce the risk of serious cardiovascular events by 20%.
Following the publication of the study, Novo Nordisk shares soared and by the end of the day, the stock’s value had risen by over 17%.
On Thursday, according to Børsen, the head of development said that current results show that people with diabetes can achieve a weight loss of over 20% by taking cagrisema.
The expectation is that people without diabetes can achieve a weight loss of over 25% on cagrisema.
He also said that amycretin has the potential to provide as much weight loss as cagrisema.
Novo Nordisk hopes to develop amycretin in pill form and as an injection simultaneously, Lange told Reuters.

Total Income and Investment Returns of DKK 31 billion are comprised of income from dividends and the share repurchase programmes of the Novo Group companies (Novo Nordisk A/S and Novozymes A/S, now known as Novonesis following the merger with Chr. Hansen), totalling DKK 19 billion (€2.5 billion), and Returns from the Investment Portfolio generating an income of DKK 13 billion (€1.7 billion) when including all Investment Assets. The 5- and 10-year trailing returns for the Investment Portfolio are 10.1% for both horizons.
Novo Holdings closed 2023 with Total Assets under Management of DKK 1,114 billion (€149 billion), up from DKK 805 billion (€108 billion) in 2022.
Kasim Kutay, CEO of Novo Holdings, said:
“The strong performance of our Investment Portfolio, coupled with our diversification efforts, led to 9.4% returns in 2023, which is above industry benchmarks. By generating attractive long-term returns, Novo Holdings enables the growth of the Novo Nordisk Foundation’s grant-giving capacity in medical, scientific, and humanitarian fields.”
A year of high investment activity
The Novo Holdings Investment Portfolio comprises Life Science Investments (Seed Investments, Venture Investments, Bioindustrial Investments, Asia Investments, Growth Investments and Principal Investments), making up 51% of the portfolio, and Capital Investments, 49% of the portfolio.
In 2023, Life Science Investments reported a DKK 5 billion (€0.7 billion) return, compared to a negative DKK -6 billion (€-0.9 billion) return in 2022.
Capital Investments reported a DKK 8 billion (€.1.0 billion) return, compared to a negative DKK -5 billion (€-0.7 billion) return in 2022.
2023 was characterised by high investment activity across most of Novo Holdings’ various investment verticals. Novo Holdings welcomed 30 new companies to the Investment Portfolio and exited 26 companies. By year-end, the Investment Portfolio included a total of 170 companies.
During a year where global biotech investment activity was less vigorous, Novo Holdings continued to support life sciences companies in their efforts to improve health outcomes for patients and to foster better planetary health.
“Among notable investments in the life sciences space in 2023, we acquired Denmark-based company Ellab, which provides crucial validation and monitoring solutions and services for biotech and pharmaceutical processes,” Kasim Kutay said.
“2023 was also a good year for Capital Investments, our non-life science investment team. Capital Investments closed the year with DKK 98 billion (€13 billion) of investment assets and generated a return of 9% versus a negative return of -6% in 2022. Highlights for 2023 include investments in Euroclear, a global provider of financial market infrastructure, and Glentra Capital, a new energy transition investment firm which was co-founded by Novo Holdings in 2022.”
New strategy to accelerate the green transition of industry and society
2023 marked the completion of Novo Holdings’ 5-year strategy period, with returns exceeding expectations. Milestones achieved over the past 5 years include the launch of an investment platform in Asia headquartered in Singapore, the establishment of a global Bioindustrial Investments vertical, and the acceleration of private equity investment activities in North America.
In 2024, Novo Holdings will start its Strategy 2030 journey, which encompasses operational scaling and the acceleration of green transition investments. By 2030, Novo Holdings aims to increase its green transition investment allocation from approximately 2% to 10% of its total investment funds. The focus will be on companies focused on planetary health across the value chain including technology, growth, scaling and infrastructure.
A key contributor to Novo Holdings’ efforts to advance planetary health is Novonesis, the company that has emerged as the result of the combination of Novozymes and Chr. Hansen. With the merger closed at the beginning of 2024, Novonesis is set to become an industrial biosolutions powerhouse, harnessing the power of biotechnology to transform consumer products and make industrial and agricultural processes more sustainable and efficient.
“In summary, 2023 was an exciting year for Novo Holdings, and 2024 holds promising opportunities. Novo Holdings recently announced an agreement to acquire Catalent, a world leading global Contract Development and Manufacturing Organisation (CDMO). In connection with this agreement, Novo Nordisk has agreed to acquire three of Catalent’s fill/finish sites from Novo Holdings. With a transaction value at $16.5 billion, the transaction will represent our largest ever investment. The transaction is expected to close by year-end of the calendar year 2024,” Kasim Kutay said.
* This performance report is an unaudited version of the 2023 performance of Novo Holdings. The audited version of the 2023 Annual Report of Novo Holdings is expected to be released in May 2024, as it is dependent on the release of the consolidated financial statements of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, expected to be released later than in previous years due to the merger of Chr. Hansen and Novozymes.
**The Investment Portfolio excludes Special Investments, which comprise investments that are made at below market return targets (e.g. impact investments), and assets that are held for Novo Nordisk Foundation strategic purposes. Including all assets, the Total Investment Return is 7%.
2023 highlights
The Novo Group Companies, Novo Nordisk A/S and Novozymes A/S delivered strong annual results. Novo Nordisk's sales increased by 31% in DKK and by 36% at constant exchange rates, and Novozymes reported 5% organic sales growth in 2023.
The Capital Investments portfolio generated a profit of DKK 7.6 billion (€1.0 billion), compared to DKK -5.1 billion (€-0.7 billion) in 2022. Capital Investments’ public portfolio had a solid performance in 2023 with returns on par with the benchmark for the year, and above our long-term average returns. The private portfolio faced a more difficult year, as higher interest rates had a negative impact on valuations. Notable investments in 2023 include a €267 million investment in EuroClear, a global provider of financial market infrastructure.
Principal Investments realised total proceeds of $1.3 billion (€1.2 billion) (including the sale of Synlab, which was not closed at year-end). These proceeds have in part been generated by full or partial divestments of 7 shareholdings, predominantly from the public portfolio. The most significant exit is the agreement to sell the ~17% shareholding in European listed company Synlab to Cinven for €10 per share returning a total of €380 million. Principal Investments made a new platform investment with the acquisition of Ellab, a global leader in providing validation and monitoring solutions and services mainly for biotech and pharma processes.
At the beginning of 2023, Growth Investments executed a new $40 million (€36 million) investment in Evosep, to further Evosep’s technology and application portfolio. Growth Investments executed one follow-on investment in 2023, deploying DKK 0.5 billion (€0.1 billion) in Oxford Biomedica, a leading gene and cell therapy group focused on developing life-changing treatments for serious diseases. During 2023, Growth Investments received capital returns of DKK 13 million (€2 million).
Venture Investments deployed DKK 3.6 billion (€0.5 billion) in 2023, including DKK 1.4 billion (€0.2 billion) committed to 15 new investments. Notable new investments include 4D Molecular, Alentis Therapeutics, BioGeneration Capital Fund V, CARGO Therapeutics, Cymabay, Fire1, Hillstar Bio, Lexeo Therapeutics, ManaT Bio, Maplight Therapeutics, Octave Health, Pureos Bioventures Fund II, Ray Therapeutics, Terremoto Biosciences and Scion Fund I. Venture Investments exited 16 investments, and realised DKK 3.4 billion (€0.5 billion) from the sale of publicly traded stock as well as from the acquisition of several of our portfolio companies.
Seed Investments deployed DKK 1.2 billion (€0.2 billion) in 2023, including significant investments in Hemab Therapeutics, Adcendo, Acesion Pharma and Commit Biologics. Other notable activities in 2023 include the establishment of Seed Investments’ own experimental incubator laboratory in Denmark and the acquisition of Paratek Pharmaceuticals through the REPAIR Impact Fund. Seed Investments raised >$460 million (€417 million) for its portfolio in 2023, and by year-end, the portfolio comprised 36 companies. Most of the portfolio consists of private investments, valued at DKK 3.5 billion (€0.5 billion) at year end, 41% higher than at the end of 2022.
The REPAIR Impact Fund closed the acquisition of Paratek Pharmaceuticals together with Gurnet Point Capital. Paratek is one of the leading independent antibiotics companies in the world, and the transaction was valued at approximately $462 million (€419 million). Further, the REPAIR Impact Fund co-led the $37 million (€34 million) series A financing for LimmaTech Biologics and supported the $10 million (€9 million) series B financing for Revagenix. By year-end, the REPAIR Impact Fund was valued at DKK 798 million (€107 million), compared to DKK 317 million (€43 million) at the end of 2022.
Bioindustrial Investments executed seven investments during 2023, deploying DKK 1 billion (€0.1 billion). Notable transactions include co-leading the $17 million (€15 million) series A financing of Aquafortus, a water technology company that purifies high salinity brines. Another water-tech investment was the €4.7 million investment in HPNow, a Danish firm pioneering an innovative form of water treatment. Additionally, Bioindustrial Investments completed follow-on investments in several portfolio companies, including 21st. BIO, Bactolife, Biomason, Deep Branch and LanzaTech. By the end of the year, the Bioindustrial Investments portfolio was valued at DKK 4.1 billion (€0.6 billion) and included 23 companies, of which 22 were private and one public.
Asia Investments invests across life science subsectors, applying a tailored approach to each region and country. Most of the portfolio consists of direct, private investments, valued at DKK 2.7 billion (€0.4 billion) at year-end, compared with DKK 1.4 billion (€0.2 billion) at the end of 2022. Notable transactions in 2023 include co-leading of the series C financing in LePure Biotech, a leading provider of high-quality and innovative single-use bioprocessing solutions in China. Further, Asia Investments participated as a cornerstone investor in the $470 million (€426 million) IPO of WuXi XDC for listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Additional highlights include participation in the $135 million (€122 million) series D financing of Halodoc and participation in the $39 million (€35 million) series C1 financing of Doctor Anywhere.

In an intriguing turn of events, just days after the annual International Obesity Day on March 4, Novo Nordisk leapfrogged electric vehicle titan Tesla in terms of market value.
Read more:
The latest data from financial firm FACTSET places Novo Nordisk at 12th place globally, boasting a market value of $604 billion, while Tesla takes the 13th spot with a market cap of ""merely"" $569 billion.
The news didn't catch Tesla's Elon Musk off guard though. Previously, Novo Nordisk had shared promising results from the first phase of clinical trials for Amycretin - the company's pioneering weight loss pill. This novel approach for weight loss, delivered orally rather than via injections, demonstrated a weight reduction of more than 13% among participants in just 12 weeks.
Compared to Wegovy, which showed a 6% decrease in the same period, this was a significant outcome. This announcement sparked an 8% rally in the company's shares, paving the way for Novo Nordisk to outstrip Tesla.
While Novo Nordisk's ground-breaking weight loss pill still has to navigate through two more trial phases, gain approval from the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and launch globally, it will take a few more years.
Meanwhile, the Israeli public is set to benefit from Wegovy, the older sibling of Amycretin, which is poised to launch in the country in the upcoming weeks. Already approved for weight loss in the country, doctors will soon be able to prescribe Wegovy to patients with a BMI of 30 or above, or those with a BMI of 27 and above who also have other risk factors such as high blood pressure, sleep apnea, or high cholesterol.
Wegovy, like its predecessor Ozempic, is an injection containing the active ingredient Semaglutide but at a dosage that's 2.4 times higher. Semaglutide is currently a leading player in the ""GLP1 receptor agonists"" drug category. GLP1, a human hormone with receptors in various human tissues, including the brain's hunger and fullness center, is known to be deficient in people with obesity. Given that Semaglutide's chemical composition is nearly identical to human GLP1, it amplifies the effects of hunger suppression and satiety enhancement.
The robust dosage of Semaglutide in Wegovy has showcased its efficacy in weight reduction, with the statistics underscoring its effectiveness. Based on findings from the STEP research team, who compared the drug's impact with a placebo, it's estimated that 90% of patients receiving Wegovy will manifest a positive response in the preliminary phase (a minimum of 5% weight loss within 5 months).The projected average weight loss hovers around 20% following 68 weeks of administration. After a two-year consistent treatment regimen, patients on Wegovy are predicted to shed 15.2% of their total weight.
To put this in perspective, Saxenda, the sole injection currently greenlit in Israel for obesity treatment, results in an average weight decrease of just 8%.
Weight reduction wasn't the sole benefit observed in the STEP study (a phased clinical trial preceding FDA approval). Trial participants who received this injection also experienced notable reductions in blood pressure and blood sugar levels. So significant was this effect that the majority of those initially identified as ""prediabetic"" completely reversed this condition. Consequently, a single medication like Wegovy could potentially tackle multiple health issues that collectively amplify the risk of heart-related incidents, cerebrovascular events, and mortality.
How do you use it?
Wegovy is a weekly self-administered subcutaneous injection. To achieve the standard and recommended dosage of Wegovy, which is notably 2.4 mg per week, an individual has to undergo a four-month period of gradual acclimatization to the drug (in contrast to two months for Ozempic).
The objective of this phased approach is to prevent possible discomforting side effects, which will be elaborated on subsequently. During the initial month of Wegovy treatment, a 0.25 mg injection is utilized, in the second month - a 0.5 mg dose, in the third month - a 1 mg dose, in the fourth month - a 1.7 mg dose, and from the fifth month onwards - a 2.4 mg dose.
Wegovy's side effects bear resemblance to those associated with other GLP1 receptor agonist drugs such as Ozempic and Saxenda. The primary symptoms stem from the digestive system, including nausea, diarrhea or constipation, stomach pain, flatulence, and heartburn. These symptoms are relatively commonplace, typically mild, and tend to lessen gradually, particularly if the patient endures through the four-month acclimation process to the drug.
As per the STEP study findings, a mere 7% of individuals are likely to become so disheartened by gastrointestinal issues that they entirely cease the treatment. Refuting prevalent online rumors, these studies did not record any rise in instances of pancreatitis, depression, or cancer compared to the placebo group.
It's important to note that Ozempic is globally recognized, including in Israel, as a medication used exclusively for managing diabetes, and not for weight loss. Until now, only non-diabetic patients with obesity could acquire it in Israel, and solely from private pharmacies, provided their doctor consented or was convinced to complete a special form, 29G. This intricate process, coupled with the Ozempic supply shortage, has inflicted considerable inconvenience on doctors, patients, and pharmacists, substantially impacting the continuity of treatment.
Conversely, Wegovy, a drug intended for obesity treatment, has already been approved in Israel, eliminating the need for this exhaustive bureaucratic process. Nonetheless, in the initial months following its introduction in Israel, it is anticipated that Wegovy will solely be available in the private market, and primary care physicians in health funds will not have the option to prescribe it to patients who are interested.
It is projected that, at a later stage, the medication will be accessible to patients via the Additional Health Services (supplementary services provided by health funds to their members for an added fee). The drug hasn't been included in the 2024 National List of Health Services, and its inclusion in the coming years remains uncertain. By that time, perhaps Elon Musk will have introduced an innovative model that reclaims its erstwhile prominence.",https://www.ynetnews.com/business/article/bjr4hp3ta

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) – Novo Holdings, the controlling shareholder of Danish obesity drugmaker Novo Nordisk, plans to open an office in India this year to tap innovation and a growing healthcare market, its CEO Kasim Kutay said on Tuesday.
The firm, whose assets under management rose to 149 billion euros ($163 billion) at the end of 2023 from 108 billion a year earlier, manages a portfolio of 170 companies across life sciences and capital investments in equities, fixed-income assets, and real estate.
It has seen a surge in revenue from Novo Nordisk, the maker of blockbuster obesity drug Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic.
Novo Holdings, the investment arm of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, owning 28% of the drugmaker’s equity and 77% of the voting shares, established offices in Singapore in 2021 and in Shanghai in 2022, and plans to open one in Mumbai this year.
“That obviously speaks to the ambitions that we have in that region,” Kutay told Reuters in an interview, adding that the company will invest between $300 million and $500 million in Asia each year in the coming five years.
The company has already invested in Indian private hospital chain Manipal Hospitals and in Qure.ai, which specialises in reading and interpreting medical images such as X-rays, CTs and ultrasounds.
Novo Holdings has also invested in four China-based companies and three in Southeast Asia.
“You’ve got huge populations, growing middle classes that want more healthcare, governments that are focusing on greater provision of healthcare, and they’re increasingly a source of innovation,” Kutay said.
“Put all of that together, and those countries are going to be very, very important markets for us,” he said.
Most of the investments in Asia will be in growth equity, rather than larger buyouts, he said.
Novo Holdings’ total income last year stood at 31 billion Danish crowns, of which 19 billion came from its ownership of Novo Nordisk and Novonesis and 13 billion were returns from its investment portfolio.
Novo Holdings said last month it would buy manufacturing subcontractor Catalent for $16.5 billion and resell three plants to Novo Nordisk to boost Wegovy output.
Kutay said that deal was a one-off and that Novo Holdings would avoid any overlap with Novo Nordisk such as diabetes or obesity.
Novo Holdings has not yet fully developed a strategy for Catalent but there are no plans to sell off any assets, he said.

Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceutical titan, recently made headlines with its promising early-stage trial results for amycretin, an experimental weight loss pill.
On March 7, the company announced that amycretin could potentially double the effectiveness of its already popular weight loss drug, Wegovy, setting the stage for a new era in obesity treatment. This news resulted in the company’s stock surging.
Novo Nordisk’s CEO, Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen, said that amycretin “could develop into a best-in-class medicine.” The firm is renowned for revolutionizing the weight loss medication market with the FDA-approved Wegovy in 2021, building on the unexpected weight reduction benefits of its diabetes drug, Ozempic.
The success of Wegovy and Ozempic has not only catapulted Novo Nordisk into Europe’s top-valued company status, surpassing luxury conglomerate LVMH last year, but also significantly contributed to Denmark’s economic growth.

The introduction of amycretin propelled Novo Nordisk’s market valuation above that of Tesla, ranking it as the 12th most valuable company globally. Here’s a deeper look into what makes amycretin a potential game-changer in weight loss medication.
Amycretin vs. Wegovy: What’s the Difference?
Where amycretin stands out from Wegovy is in its stimulation of two different gut hormones — GLP-1 and amylin — compared to Wegovy, which only stimulates GLP-1. Both GLP-1 and amylin play crucial roles in regulating blood sugar levels and appetite. Moreover, amycretin offers the convenience of a daily pill, whereas Wegovy requires weekly injections.
How Effective is Amycretin?
A small ongoing trial of the drug involving obese Japanese men, amycretin led to an average weight loss of 13% over 12 weeks. This result is notable compared to Wegovy’s 15% weight reduction observed over 68 weeks in a larger trial.
However, upcoming phase II, III, and IV trials with more participants are necessary to validate these findings further.
Will Amycretin Replace Wegovy?
Jørgensen shared with CNBC, “We believe in the future, there will be different segments of anti-obesity treatments, different patients having different preferences.”
He doesn’t expect amycretin to completely replace Wegovy in the market.
“Some will prefer an injectable. And we really believe that a once-weekly injectable is a very convenient offering,” Jørgensen stated.
When Will Amycretin Hit the Market?
The timeline for amycretin’s market debut remains tentative, with a phase II trial set for the latter half of this year and results expected by early 2026.
Martin Holst Lange, Novo Nordisk’s head of development, told Reuters, “I never commit to timelines but I would be very comfortable to say at the very least within this decade.”",https://www.dagens.com/health-0/a-weight-loss-pill-more-powerful-than-ozempic-in-development-at-novo-nordisk

Former President Donald Trump discussed selling his social media site Truth Social to Elon Musk last summer, the Washington Post reported Tuesday, at the same time the company that planned to take the social network public faced an SEC investigation and regulatory pressure.
Key Facts
The proposal ultimately didn’t lead to a deal, the Post reported, citing unnamed sources.
The talks came before the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a proposed merger in February between Trump Media & Technology Group, the mostly Trump-owned company that owns Truth Social, and blank check firm Digital World Acquisition Corp in a deal that would take the company public.
Trump was reportedly trying to sell the social network at the time, and SEC filings from 2023 revealed that Trump Media & Technology Group had lost over $31 million since it began operating Truth Social in 2021—only making a profit in 2022.
Musk previously criticized Truth Social, saying it has a “terrible name” and only “exists because Twitter censored free speech.”
Although Musk reinstated Trump’s Twitter account in November 2022 shortly after purchasing Twitter for $44 billion, the former president has only posted one time since—reportedly to retain value for Truth Social.
Musk has met with the former president before, including once last week in a meeting reported by The New York Times, but the billionaire also stated that he was “not donating money to either candidate for US President” in a post on X shortly after news of the meeting broke.
Musk has not returned a request for comment from Forbes, and only told the Washington Post that he has “never been to Mar-a-Lago,” and Trump’s campaign and media company have also not commented on the report.
Tangent
The merger between TMTG and Digital World—known as a special-purpose acquisition company—was first announced in 2021, but was delayed as they sought regulatory approval from the SEC. In July 2023, Digital World agreed to pay an $18 million penalty to settle an SEC investigation for violating stock trading rules, with the agency alleging Digital World hadn’t told investors it had begun planning a merger with TMTG before going public. Although the merger was supposed to happen before September 2023, the company’s shareholders eventually extended the deadline and gave the company more time to facilitate the deal.
Key Background
Elon Musk, who considers himself a political moderate, previously served on Donald Trump’s business advisory council. Although Musk said he retained the position to promote causes like sustainable energy and oppose Trump’s immigration policy, the billionaire publicly resigned from his position in 2017 after Trump pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. One of Musk’s biggest rifts with the former president is the issue of electric vehicles. Much of Musk’s wealth comes from his ownership of Tesla stock, but EVs have emerged as one of Trump’s biggest punching bags in the 2024 campaign, calling car companies that produce them “either stupid or they’re gutless.” However, Musk has recently begun promoting more conservative causes, primarily concerning immigration and conspiracy theories about elections.
Forbes Valuation
We estimate Musk’s net worth is about $196.5 billion, making him the second-wealthiest person in the world. Trump is worth an estimated $2.6 billion.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/zacharyfolk/2024/03/12/donald-trump-discussed-selling-truth-social-to-elon-musk-report-says/

Trump made the proposal to Musk in the summer of 2023, according to a report from The Washington Post, which cited two sources with knowledge of their meeting.
The idea appeared to have been Trump’s. Although no deal was made on the website, the reporting reveals that the two have communicated much more than was previously known, particularly on business matters but potentially on issues relating to politics as well.
Beyond the proposed sale of Truth Social, Musk and Trump met earlier this month in Palm Beach, Florida. The details of that meeting are murky, but there is some speculation that it involved the 2024 presidential election in some way, as well-known Republican donors also took part.
Unsubstantiated rumors on X suggesting that Musk was going to endorse or donate to Trump’s campaign soon spread, resulting in Musk posting on the site that he was not planning to donate to either of the major parties’ candidates for president.
Truth Social has faced problems since its inception. Originally billed as a supposed bastion of free speech, the far right, MAGA-friendly social media site has been mired in a number of controversies, including at one point banning accounts simply for being critical of Trump.
Financially, the site has arguably fared even worse. In more recent reports on its performance, Truth Social announced that it lost tens of millions of dollars in the first nine months of 2023 alone.
Meanwhile, according to Buffer, a site that measures social media analytics, Truth Social doesn’t rank at all on its list of the top 23 social media sites. The only thing keeping the site relevant appears to be the fact that Trump uses it as his primary social media.
Although X is doing far better, Musk seems to be hampering the platform rather than improving it. In the fall of 2022, Musk purchased the site, then known as Twitter, for $44 billion (with the help of wealthy backers, including Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Al Saud), after spending several months criticizing its rules on banning dangerous and false content. After buying the platform, Musk restored several far right accounts, including that of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Musk himself has also disseminated antisemitic content on the site. Despite Musk claiming to be a supporter of absolute free speech, the platform frequently suspends accounts critical of him.
As a result of Musks’ leadership, X has seen its values go down significantly, with a report in January 2024 finding that the site’s worth has dropped by 71.5 percent since Musk took over.
Trump is silencing political dissent. We appeal for your support.
Progressive nonprofits are the latest target caught in Trump’s crosshairs. With the aim of eliminating political opposition, Trump and his sycophants are working to curb government funding, constrain private foundations, and even cut tax-exempt status from organizations he dislikes.
We’re concerned, because Truthout is not immune to such bad-faith attacks.
We can only resist Trump’s attacks by cultivating a strong base of support. The right-wing mediasphere is funded comfortably by billionaire owners and venture capitalist philanthropists. At Truthout, we have you.

Donald Trump once offered to sell Truth Social to Elon Musk, The Washington Post reported.
The former president made the suggestion last summer, according to the Post, which cited two unnamed sources.
Musk took over Twitter, now known as X, in late 2022 and served as CEO before appointing Linda Yaccarino to the role in early June last year.
The Post reported that Musk and Trump have been in contact more than was previously known, with Trump continuing to tell confidants that the Tesla CEO should buy the platform despite earlier talks going nowhere.
Trump confirmed he recently met with Musk in a CNBC interview. The former president said he didn't know if Musk would endorse him.
Musk reinstated Trump's Twitter account in November 2022, just weeks after he took control of the company in a $44 billion deal. Trump was originally kicked off Twitter following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot.
However, Trump has preferred using Truth Social despite having far fewer followers there than on X.
Representatives for Musk and Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider, made outside normal working hours. The Post quoted brief remarks from Musk and a Trump Media representative that did not address the substance of the Post's report.
Trump's ""free speech"" platform has faced significant financial hurdles since it launched in 2022.
According to SEC filings in November, Truth Social lost tens of millions of dollars last year.
Trump Media and Technology Group, the company that owns Truth Social, has faced a series of delays over its planned merger with the Digital World Acquisition Corp. Last month, the SEC cleared the way for the deal, which has been seen as a major boost for Trump.
Correction: March 15, 2024 — An earlier version of this story overstated what was known from The Washington Post's report about when Donald Trump was said to have offered to sell Truth Social to Elon Musk. The Post said the offer came in ""the summer"" but did not specify who was running X at the time. Linda Yaccarino started as CEO of X, then still Twitter, in early June, before the technical start of summer. The story also mischaracterized whether Trump and Musk had responded to queries for comment from the Post.

The conversation, which has been kept under wraps until now, didn't come to anything. At the time, Truth Social faced significant financial challenges.
Trump founded Truth Social in February 2022, about a year after he was kicked off Twitter (now X) and Meta's apps following the Jan. 6, 2021, riots at the Capitol. Truth Social functions the same way as X, though users share ""truths"" and ""retruths"" instead of ""tweets"" and ""retweets."" By 2023, the platform had burned through cash and failed to attract sufficient ad revenue. It reported $31.6 million in losses between 2021 and mid-2023, according to Reuters.
After Musk's Twitter takeover, he restored Trump's account, though Trump has only posted on X once since then, when his mug shot came out. Trump has been more active on Facebook since Meta restored his accounts there last year, mostly with campaign-related posts, but his unedited thoughts usually end up on Truth Social.
Truth Social got the financial relief it needed last month, when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved the long-delayed merger of Truth Social with Digital World Acquisition, The Washington Post reports. The deal sets the stage for Truth Social to become a publicly traded company and unlocks a much-needed $300 million in investor cash.
Musk and Trump have continued to communicate, most recently meeting at Mar-a-Lago. Neither has publicly disclosed the nature of the conversation. After reports suggested Trump could be asking Musk, the world's second-richest man, for funds amid his most recent legal troubles, Musk posted on X that he is “not donating money to either candidate for US President.”

He did anyway.
“They are like, you got a little bit of time. I’m like, ‘I’m reading the Trump tweet. They’re like, ‘No, no, don’t read that. I’m like, ‘Yes I am’,” Kimmel recounted to Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos on Live with Kelly & Mark.
During the Oscar show, Trump had posted on his social media site Truth Social a critique of the Oscarcast and Kimmel’s performance.
So Kimmel went on stage and read it, generating one of the more memorable punchlines of a recent Oscar ceremony.

From his phone, Kimmel read, “Has there ever been a worse host than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars. His opening was that of a less than average person trying too hard to be something which he is not, and never can be. Get rid of Kimmel and perhaps replace him with another washed up, but cheap, ABC ‘talent,’ George Slopanopoulos. He would make everybody on stage look bigger, stronger, and more glamorous. Blah. Blah. Blah. Make America Great Again.”

Kimmel then gave his reaction to the bad review: “Thank you President Trump. Thank you for watching. I’m surprised you’re still, ah…isn’t it past your jail time?” The audience cheered.

Someone else wrote Trump’s message. He is not capable of complete sentences. He is not clever enough to make jokes either
Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t it Mr Trump that did not like “Hamilton”?
Get off Twitter already and no one should be using truth social you’re supporting bigots both ways companies need to fire anyone using either
Fire him already the guy keeps giving trump more attention because he’s not actually funny
It wasn’t funny. He’s not funny. He beats a dead horse. Move on
I am trying to be a more compassionate person but when I see a grown man who is running for the highest office in America acting like a spoiled immature child on TV and this was so silly He was making fun of someone stuttering this made me dislike his making fun of someone’s disability. I grew up with a brother who had a terrible time with stuttering I have seen my brother become so hurt over this so you can imagine how unbecoming this made this grown man look. So from the beginning I have had a bad feeling about putting this wacko in office pray for our country God help us.
It was fucking hilarious! Trump is the butt of every joke of his own making. He’s an absolute embarrassment to the USA.
Amen!!!
Why do the producers care if Kimmel wanted to read the post? It’s not as if a large swath of Middle America was tuned in to begin with. It’s no secret which side of the line the majority of Hollywood elites stand either. Normally I would say keep impassioned political views separate from entertainment. But Kimmel read it in such as a way to make it entertaining. That’s really what it comes down. Absurd comedy.
What’s absurd is that millions of ignorant and deranged Americans think a twice-impeached and indicted insurrectionist who has nothing better to do on the eve of his criminal trials than to troll the Oscars should be back in the White House.
Well said!

“Has there EVER been a WORSE HOST than Jimmy Kimmel at The Oscars. His opening was that of a less than average person trying too hard to be something which he is not, and never can be,” Kimmel read aloud from his phone.

Kimmel then quipped: “See if you can guess which former president just posted that on Truth Social.”
Per Trump’s Truth Social page, nearly all of what Kimmel read aloud had been posted verbatim to Trump’s page at 9.39pm ET.
Kimmel then thanked Trump for watching before asking: “Isn’t it past your jail time?”
The crowd loudly hollered in response to the comment, which was a clear reference to the four criminal cases Trump has been charged in.
He currently faces four felony counts for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election in Washington DC, 13 felony counts for his election interference in Georgia, 34 felony counts in connection with hush-money payments to the adult film star Stormy Daniels in New York, and 40 felony counts for hoarding classified documents in the wake of his presidency and interfering with the government’s efforts to retrieve them in Florida.

What we know about its plans.
Tyson Foods announced Monday, March 11, that it will permanently close its pork packing plant in Perry, Iowa, amid financial struggles for the pork industry.
Here is what we know about the Tyson Foods plant in Perry.
How many people will lose their jobs when Tyson closes in Perry?
As the largest employer in Perry, Tyson employs 1,276 people. The closure is expected to leave all employees without work.
Tyson said it will encourage employees to apply for other jobs within the company. Across Iowa, Tyson employs 9,000 people. A significant number of its employees are immigrants or refugees, with 60% of its national workforce representing those two categories, according to Jobs for the Future.
When will the Tyson plant close in Perry?
Perry Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh said Tyson officials told him the plant will shut down June 28. A Tyson worker also said that was the timeframe given at a meeting Monday where the closure plan was announced.
Why is Tyson closing plants?
Tyson didn't say why the Perry plant is closing. But two things stand out about the plant: its age, at 61 years for the main facility, and, according to an industry analyst, its size, which doesn't lend itself to an efficiency-increasing second shift.
At the same time, Iowa's nation-leading pork industry is coming off its worst downturn in the past 25 years, and Tyson at the end of fiscal 2023 said it had lost $128 million on its pork segment.
Tyson didn't announce any other closures in March, but Perry isn't the first plant to close recently. Plants in Jacksonville, Florida, and Columbia, South Carolina, closed at the start of 2024. Six Tyson plants closed in 2023.
What's being done for Tyson employees?
The Iowa Workforce Development will deploy its IowaWorks Mobile Workforce Center to aid the employees without work come June. The League of United Latin American Citizens Council 307 in Des Moines also said it would help the displaced workers — many of whom are Spanish-speaking — where it can.
Where is Tyson's Perry plant?
The pork processing facility is located just west of the city limits on a disused rail line that's now part of the Raccoon River Valley Trail.
How has the Tyson plant shaped Perry?
Aside from being its largest employer (and generating more than $200,000 a year in property taxes), the plant at the end of 2022 was advertising starting pay for general production workers of $18.40 an hour with a sign-on bonus of $5,000, plus an extra $1 an hour for good attendance and full benefits. Though a tad below the Iowa hourly average, that's more than 2½ times the state minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. While not all of the workers live in town, they still buy groceries, gas and other services there, Cavanaugh said. ""It's our economic base.""
The plant's heavily immigrant workforce also has helped make Perry one of the most diverse communities in Iowa. The U.S. Census shows that nearly a third of the city's 8,000 people identify as Hispanic or Latino and that almost 19% are foreign born.
What will happen to Perry after the Tyson plant closes?
The community demonstrated its resiliency earlier this year, when shootings at Perry High School left three dead. The schools are back in session and the ribbons in Perry Bluejay blue and ""Perry Strong"" remain on display throughout the town.
Cavanaugh vowed to work with other community leaders to seek a buyer for the plant. But barring a new owner, the economic impact of lost wages and population will be felt.
Area farmers also are likely to feel the effects. The plant slaughtered some 9,000 pigs a day, and they'll have to transport them farther to market and at greater expense.
When did the Tyson plant open in Perry?
The plant has been in operation in Perry since the 1960s. It became a Tyson facility after the Arkansas-based company merged with Iowa Beef Processors in 2001, according to the Perry Economic Development website.
What's the population of Perry, Iowa?
There are 7,929 residents of Perry, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Perry is nearly 40 miles northwest of Des Moines and is part of Dallas County — one of the fastest growing in the country.
Does Tyson have other plants in Iowa?
Tyson has encouraged employees to apply for other jobs with the company. It operates plants in four other Iowa communities, but none are within easy commuting distance. Tyson facilities can be found in Council Bluffs, Columbus Junction, Storm Lake and Waterloo. Storm Lake would be the closest at about an hour and 55 minutes away. The other locations are between two and three hours away.
Who owns Tyson?
Tyson was originally founded in 1935. The company went public in 1963 as Tyson's Foods, Inc under the leadership of Don Tyson, the son of the founder John Tyson. Don's son, John H. Tyson, is the current CEO and is worth an estimated $2.6 billion.
What brands does Tyson own?
Tyson has 31 brands including Hillshire Farms, Ball Park and Jimmy Dean. Tyson is one of the four big meat packers of the world, producing 20% of America's beef, pork and chicken.
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly listed the other communities in Iowa that have Tyson facilities. A facility in Independence was sold in 2021.

A pork plant and major employer in central Iowa is closing.
The Tyson Foods plant in Perry will close permanently on June 28.
""After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to permanently close our Perry, Iowa pork facility. We understand the impact of this decision on our team members and the local community. Taking care of our team members is our top priority and we encourage them to apply for other open roles within the company.

The Tyson plant is Perry's largest employer, with around 1,300 workers, according to Perry City Administrator Sven Peterson. About half of those workers live in Perry, while the other half commute.
KCCI is working to learn more about the nature of the closure.
Gov. Kim Reynolds released a statement about the closure:
“Tyson employees, the Perry community, and Iowa pork producers will have the full support of the state in the months leading up to the plant closure and after. Iowa Economic Development Authority and Iowa Workforce Development are already engaged. We stand ready to assist impacted employees with finding new jobs in the area as soon as possible. There are more than 60,000 job openings currently posted on IowaWorks.gov, and IWD provides one-to-one career counseling for anyone seeking employment.”

Its other Iowa facilities employ more than 9,000 people. In total, the company reported at the end of September that it had 139,000 workers, including 114,000 in ""non-corporate sites"" around the U.S.
""Taking care of our team members is our top priority and we encourage them to apply for other open roles within the company,"" the Tyson Foods spokesperson told FOX Business. ""We are also working closely with state and local officials to provide additional resources to those who are impacted.""
In the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024, Tyson Foods saw some improvements in its pork segment.
Tyson Foods Inc
It notched nearly $1.52 billion in quarterly sales, marking the slightest decline year over year from $1.53 billion. Meanwhile, the segment’s adjusted operating income for the quarter swung to a profit of $68 million thanks to ""improved spreads driven by lower hog cost, as well as better execution,"" Tyson Foods CFO John Tyson said during the company's first-quarter earnings call.
Tyson Foods said last month it ""anticipate[s] adjusted operating income of breakeven to $100 million in fiscal 2024"" for the pork segment.

PERRY, Iowa (KCCI) - Perry’s mayor said the closure of the city’s Tyson Foods plant will have a ripple effect across the community. The plant is the city’s largest employer.
The plant is set to close on June 28th. This will leave around 1,300 employees without a job.
Perry’s mayor met with the company on Tuesday.
He wanted to know if Tyson was going to try and sell the plant or shut it down and keep it closed. This was a question met with uncertainty.
The mayor said the closure will impact where Tyson employees spend money. He hopes to bring in a new company into Perry.
”It affects the housing market. Groceries. It affects gas stations and all the big restaurants,” Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh said. ”There may be companies that want to expand that don’t have the space. This may be a good fit.”
The United Food and Commercial Workers Union represents several of the plant’s employees.
The treasurer and secretary for the group says it has set up talks to negotiate.

“While this decision was not easy, it emphasizes our focus to optimize the efficiency of our operations to best serve our customers,” a Tyson spokesperson said in a statement to Food Dive. “Iowa remains a key state for Tyson Foods, with employment of more than 9,000 team members across our other Iowa facilities.”
The mayor of nearby Des Moines, Dirk Cavanaugh, said the plant is set to close on June 28, Reuters reported.
The spokesperson added that Tyson is working with Iowa officials to provide resources to the affected employees. It encouraged workers to apply at roles elsewhere in the company.
The Iowa closure comes after a volatile period for the company’s pork business, which has struggled with high grain costs but has shown recent signs of improving. In Tyson’s earnings call last month, CEO Donnie King said a larger supply of hogs compared to 2023 is improving its margins in pork.
The broader meat category is contending with a challenging environment as consumer demand has softened because of high prices. Companies such as Tyson, Smithfield Foods and JBS Foods have offset losses by cutting costs within their operations.
Since the beginning of last year, Tyson alone has announced the closure of eight facilities — including six chicken plants and two case-ready meat processing plants — as it works to boost efficiency through its manufacturing capabilities. The Perry, Iowa, location would be its ninth.
Despite the recent closures, Tyson is investing in other areas of its business where it sees higher growth potential. In January, the meat and poultry company opened a $355 million automated bacon processing plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky.",https://www.fooddive.com/news/tyson-to-shutter-pork-plant-perry-iowa-jobs-layoff-meat-industry-costs/709989/

“While this decision was not easy, it emphasizes our focus to optimize the efficiency of our operations to best serve our customers,” the company said in a statement.
The move comes after Tyson Foods’ pork division posted a $139 million operating loss in the company’s fiscal 2023, down from a $193 million profit the year before. Sales also fell on an annual basis from $6.4 billion to $5.8 billion.
Perry Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh said the move to close the plant caught the town and the plant’s workers by surprise. He said he only learned of Tyson Foods’ decision when a representative called him at 1 p.m. Monday. Just two years ago, after Tyson Foods bought land surrounding the plant to expand, and officials rerouted a county bike lane so as not to interfere with Tyson Foods traffic.
Cavanaugh said about 760 of the plant’s employees live in Perry or the surrounding unincorporated areas. Perry has a population of 8,200 and is 25 miles from Des Moines, the state capital. Cavanaugh said the city hasn’t determined the economic impact the closing will have.
“We thought we had a pretty good thing going here,” he said. “It seemed like business as usual. They were happy to be here, and we were happy to have them here.”
The facility is the ninth that Tyson Foods has moved to shut down since early 2023. Most have been facilities that served the company’s struggling chicken segment. The company has also cut costs by reducing its leadership positions by 15% and its corporate positions by 10%.
Tyson Foods didn’t provide many details about the decision to close the Perry plant. It did say it was working with state and local officials to help those affected; Tyson Foods said it employs 9,000 people in Iowa.
“After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to permanently close our Perry, Iowa pork facility,” a company spokesman said in an email. “We understand the impact of this decision on our team members and the local community. Taking care of our team members is our top priority and we encourage them to apply for other open roles within the company. “
Cavanaugh said his biggest concern now, other than for the employees who will lose their jobs, is whether or not Tyson Foods will sell the plant. The plant has been in production for one meat producer or another for decades.
“We have a ready-made situation for someone to come in, retool and be ready to go,” Cavanaugh said. “They may not want a competitor [getting the plant]. We need something.”",https://www.arkansasbusiness.com/article/tyson-foods-to-close-iowa-pork-plant-affecting-nearly-1300-jobs/

Arkansas-based Tyson Foods says it’s permanently closing its Perry pork packing plant, a move that will leave the 1,276 workers at the city's largest employer without jobs.
“After careful consideration, we have made the difficult decision to permanently close our Perry, Iowa, pork facility,” a company spokesman said in an email Monday.
Tyson said it will encourage employees to apply for other positions within the company. Tyson said it still employs 9,000 people in Iowa, and it has pork facilities in Waterloo, Storm Lake and Columbus Junction.
It’s the second big blow this year to Perry, a town of about 7,930 residents that already was struggling with a January school shooting that left three dead and injured six others.
“It’s our economic base,” said Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh, adding that it’s unlikely relocating Perry workers would remain in the community.
Cavanaugh said company officials told him the closure will come in late June.
While not all Tyson workers live in Perry, they still buy groceries, gas and other services there, he said. “It’s a large percentage of our community,” he said, adding that he plans to work with local, state and company leaders to find a new employer to use the plant space.
Gov. Kim Reynolds said Monday in a statement that “Tyson employees, the Perry community, and Iowa pork producers will have the full support of the state in the months leading up to the plant closure and after.""
The Iowa Economic Development Authority and Iowa Workforce Development are ""already engaged,"" Reynolds said. ""We stand ready to assist impacted employees with finding new jobs in the area as soon as possible,"" with about 60,000 job openings posted on IowaWorks.gov.
The United Food and Commercial Workers union Local 1149 represents between 700 and 800 of the plant’s employees.
""We feel that Tyson owes that community (Perry) and the employees some kind of compensation, some kind of training, some kind of benefit for a lot of those families,"" said the union’s president, Roger Kail.
“We’re definitely going to be asking for some kind of compensation for these people. We’re going to try and get as much as we can get for these people, because they deserve it,” Kail said.
He said the union would help as many people as it can to find other jobs, but the openings in other packing plants are starting to tighten up.
Workers coming off shift left the Tyson plant Monday afternoon holding their lunch bags and walking with their heads down.
“They told us in a meeting they were closing down the business,” Jaime Morales, a worker who has been with the company for more than three years, told the Register in Spanish.
Talks about the plant closing had been spreading among workers but there wasn’t an official announcement from the company until Monday, Morales said. “There’s nothing you really can do besides look for another job,” he said.
Closure announcement follows tough year for pork industry
The move comes after the pork industry has encountered staggering losses over the past year.
“I’m disappointed but not surprised,” given the grim economic conditions pork producers are struggling with, said Pat McGonegle, CEO of the Iowa Pork Producers Association.
The Perry facility slaughtered and processed about 9,000 hogs each day, and Iowa producers who sold to that plant now will need to seek out others. “Typically, the cost of that transition has been borne by producers,” McGonegle said.
“The economic times in our industry are very difficult right now,” he said.
Last year was the worst financial downturn in a quarter century for Iowa and U.S. pork producers, with rising costs outstripping prices farmers received for their livestock, experts have said.
Pork producer losses averaged $32 per hog last year, Lee Schulz, an Iowa State University economist, said last month. Losses are forecast to shrink to $18 per head this year, he said.
""You could say there's a little bit of sunshine this year,"" McGonegle said, adding that he hopes no other Iowa pork plants close.
Steve Meyer, chief livestock economist at Ever.Ag, a Texas-based agricultural technology, risk management and market analysis company, said the ""packer market has been good since mid-last year.""
""We're going to have plenty of hogs and we'll need all the space that's left out there,” Meyer said.
He said Tyson likely targeted the Perry plant because its size and age made it difficult to add a second shift, which limits operation efficiency.
""I think that is probably the big driver"" of Tyson's decision to close it, he said.
Tyson has been experiencing headwinds since last year, when it closed chicken processing plants in Jacksonville, Florida; Columbia, South Carolina; Van Buren and North Little Rock, Arkansas; Glen Allen, Virginia; Corydon, Indiana; and Dexter and Noel, Missouri.
Tyson said it understands ""the impact of this decision on our team members"" and the Perry community. ""We are also working closely with state and local officials to provide additional resources to those who are impacted,” the company said.
“While this decision was not easy, it emphasizes our focus to optimize the efficiency of our operations to best serve our customers,” the spokesman said.
Closure announcement not the first for Perry plant
In 2018, Tyson won $674,000 in state incentives as it made a $44 million upgrade to the plant. The Iowa Economic Development Authority said Monday no incentives ultimately were released for the project.
Cavanaugh said he had hoped the expansion would help keep the plant operating in Perry. He said the community has been in a similar spot before, experiencing ups and downs with the industry for decades.
After a meatpacking plant closed in Perry in the mid-1950s, the Iowa Pork Co. organized to build a new plant on the now-Tyson site in 1962, and it quickly became Perry’s largest employer, according to a history by Perry Economic Development.
Perry Economic Development said Oscar Mayer Inc. bought the plant in 1965. On Christmas Eve 1988, just as Oscar Mayer was preparing to close the plant, it announced that it would instead sell it to IBP Inc., and that it would remain in operation. Tyson took over IBP in 2001.

The potential seizure of the Corridor by the Russians will block the land route to the Baltic countries for NATO allies.
The Kremlin is seriously considering the possibility of seizing the Suwalki Corridor and is attempting to create a ""missile umbrella"" over the potential breakthrough area.
This opinion was expressed by military expert Dmytro Snehyriov, as reported by ""Espreso.""
According to him, a month ago, during the testing of Russian electronic warfare systems, cellular communication was disrupted over a significant territory of Poland and the Baltic countries. Snehyriov believes that in this way, Russia demonstrated the capabilities of its electronic warfare systems.
Additionally, in recent months, there has been a relocation of ""Iskander"" operational-tactical missile systems to the territory of Belarus and Kaliningrad region of Russia.
""So, the Russians are trying to create a ""missile umbrella"" over the potential break through area, to create the Suwalki Corridor. Therefore, Poles and NATO countries understand the seriousness of Russia's intentions,"" the expert says.
Snehyriov reminded that the Suwalki Corridor is a land route that is supposed to connect the territory of Belarus with Kaliningrad region.
""During the military operations, both on land and at sea, the possibility of communication routes being blocked to prevent the delivery of personnel and heavy equipment by sea cannot be ruled out. It is not coincidental that large-scale NATO exercises are currently taking place in the Baltic Sea, with the participation of about 50 naval vessels. What's even more impressive is the number of aircraft – up to 100 units... over the waters of the Baltic Sea,"" the expert added.
What is the Suwalki Corridor
The Suwalki Corridor is a nearly 100-kilometer border between Poland and Lithuania. This single stretch of land connects Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia with the rest of the EU and NATO countries, while separating Russia's Kaliningrad region from Belarus. In the event of a war with Russia, its seizure by Russian forces would block NATO allies' overland access to the Baltic countries.

It enables better scalability for handling large virtual scenes and reduces cases where the CPU could bottleneck a game’s performance.
Short of running the game’s logic on the GPU, I see the pinnacle of GPU-driven rendering as a scenario in which the CPU sends the GPU only the new frame’s camera information, while the GPU takes care of the rest, all the way down to the final pixels presented on-screen.
The Direct3D 12 (D3D12) API has taken several steps in this direction, including such features as ExecuteIndirect
, Unbounded Resource Arrays, and ResourceDescriptorHeap
.
Work graphs are another feature that I’m excited to discuss. Work graphs provide a programming paradigm that enables the GPU to generate work for itself on the fly. This offers a solution to some well-known game engine problems, and opens the path to new creative ideas.
This post introduces high-level concepts of work graphs: the structure, launch modes, and data flow. I explain how a work graph can be written in HLSL, as well as the steps involved in launching a work graph from the CPU. To get the most from this post, you should have some familiarity with:
- The D3D12 API
- Writing and compilation of compute shaders
ExecuteIndirect
and ray-tracing APIs
Note that work graphs are supported on NVIDIA Ampere architecture and NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture. An NVIDIA display driver with version 551.76 or later is also required, and can be found through NVIDIA Driver Downloads.
Work graphs overview
Shader Model 6.8 for D3D12, among many other features, marks the official release of work graphs. The term ‘graph’ in the name holds up well to its definition: a collection of nodes connected by edges. In work graphs, nodes perform tasks (“work”) and pass data to other nodes across the graph edges.
But what is this work that a node executes? Is it a command such as a Dispatch
call? A single thread running a certain shader? Or perhaps a group of threads running the same shader?
The answer is, all of the above. Each node has a shader that is launched in a certain configuration of the programmer’s choice. This configuration, or launch mode, can be a full dispatch grid (broadcast launch) or compute threads run either independently of each other (thread launch) or potentially collectively (coalescing launch). Note that Thread Launch work can be gathered to run in a wave where possible, but each thread will still have its inputs independent of other threads.
A connection to another node is realized by choosing the target node and passing data to it. This resembles what is typically known as continuation in graph terminology. The target node receives the data and runs outside its caller’s context. There is no call stack in this system, just data cascading from the top to the bottom of the graph.
Units of data, called records, drive the entire execution of the work graph. To launch a node, a record must be written for it. The node’s shader is then launched in the chosen launch mode, and consumes that record as input. The record is a packed structure of data filled by the producer. The producer could be the CPU’s command DispatchGraph
, or any node in the work graph. A node consuming the record could be thought of as a child of the producer node.
Work graphs new functionality
D3D12 already exposes functionality to aid in GPU-driven rendering, as mentioned previously. This section highlights the new functionality introduced by work graphs, compared to existing functionality.
Dynamic shader selection
Each node in the work graph can choose which of its children to run. The decision is driven by the producer’s shader code itself. This enables decisions to be determined by information generated by the GPU in a previous node or workload.
On the other hand, ExecuteIndirect
is confined to work under the state it was launched with, most notably the shader specified by the pipeline state object. An application that needs to launch different shaders depending on GPU-side data has no choice but to issue a series of SetPipelineState
and ExecuteIndirect
calls, or rely on inefficient uber shaders to cover only some of the potential possibilities.
Implicit micro-dependency model
Rendering a frame involves executing several major passes, such as depth, geometry, or lighting passes. Within each pass, data is processed in parallel, where each unit of data goes through several sequential operations. Resource barriers are usually placed between the operations to ensure data processing is completed by the previous operation before moving to the next.
A work graph expresses this dependency implicitly by producer nodes passing records to children nodes. Children node shaders will only run when the producer has completed writing the record, implying that the data is fully ready for consumption by the child. Note that the scope of work graph producer-consumer dependencies are on the data record scope, whereas a resource barrier operates on all accesses to a resource.
The work graph dependency model is fine-grained compared to barriers. This can translate to better occupancy on the GPU, as dependent work can launch earlier instead of waiting for a barrier to finish. Records can immediately pass from the producer to the consumer node and need not be fully flushed across algorithm steps as is the case for Dispatch-ResourceBarrier
sequences.
Figure 2 illustrates how the workloads are executed in each case. On the left, two Dispatch
calls separated by a ResourceBarrier
. Each row represents a producer thread-group (green) and its consumer thread-group (blue). On the right, the same workloads run with a work graph.
Writing work graphs in HLSL
Similar to ray-tracing shaders, work graphs are written as a library of compute shaders. A single HLSL file may contain code for all the nodes in the graph. But it’s also possible to construct the graph from different sources and link those at once, or even gradually during run-time.
The following HLSL code snippet demonstrates a very simple work graph made of two nodes: a producer and a consumer node.
struct RecordData { int myData; };
[Shader(""node"")]
[NodeLaunch(""thread"")]
[NodeIsProgramEntry]
void MyGraphRoot(
[MaxRecords(1)] NodeOutput<RecordData> MyChildNode)
{
ThreadNodeOutputRecords<RecordData> childNodeRecord =
MyChildNode.GetThreadNodeOutputRecords(1);
childNodeRecord.Get().myData = 123456;
childNodeRecord.OutputComplete();
}
[Shader(""node"")]
[NodeLaunch(""broadcasting"")]
[NodeDispatchGrid(1, 1, 1)]
[numthreads(8, 8, 1)]
void MyChildNode(
DispatchNodeInputRecord<RecordData> inputData,
uint2 dispatchThreadId : SV_DispatchThreadID)
{
int myData = inputData.Get().myData;
}
This snippet shows how node shaders are basically regular compute shaders with some added declarations. Of note is the NodeLaunch
attribute, which specifies the launch mode for that node. The root node in the graph (signified by the NodeIsProgramEntry
attribute) is a thread launch node. Thus, for every input record, there will be a compute shader thread to process it. The root input records originate from the DispatchGraph
call in the command list.
The shader function signature includes a parameter MyChildNode
of type NodeOutput<RecordData>
. This parameter can be used to produce records going to MyChildNode
node of the graph. In this way, the name of the parameter must match with the name of another node in the graph.
MyChildNode
is a broadcasting launch node. This means that a single record pushed to such a node will cause a similar effect to a Dispatch
call with a certain grid size, determined here by the attribute NodeDispatchGrid
associated with the MyChildNode
function signature.
For more details about the new syntax and declarations, see the HLSL syntax reference for work graphs.
CPU-side setup
Launching a work graph requires similar steps needed by other kinds of work in D3D12; specifically:
- Perform feature support check
- Compile shaders either offline or during runtime
- Load shader library and construct work graph state object
- Allocate backing memory
- Launch the graph
Feature support check
To ensure work graphs are supported on the target machine, it’s necessary to call CheckFeaturesSupport
and inspect the WorkGraphsTier
field of the D3D12_FEATURE_DATA_D3D12_OPTIONS_21
structure.
Compile shaders
A work graph requires compiling the HLSL source code against the lib_6_8
shader target. There are no specific requirements to pass to the compiler, other than the standard switches used by other shader types.
Load shader library
The binaries from the compiler must be loaded and a D3D12_STATE_OBJECT_DESC
must be prepared with all the parts needed for the work graph. Quite a few pieces of information must be provided, including:
- The DXIL library to use (that is, the precompiled shader binary).
- The root signature(s) used by the work graph.
- Which nodes will make up the graph (all of them or a certain subset).
- Overrides to certain attributes already set in the shader library (if needed). These overrides can drive static values in the work graph using values determined at run-time.
Allocate backing memory
The graph also requires backing memory for use during its execution. After creating the state object, memory requirements for the graph must be queried and the allocation must be made before launching the graph. If the reported backing memory requirement has a minimum size different from the maximum size, it’s recommended to respect the maximum size to enable best performance of graph execution.
Launch the graph
This step is very similar to launching a compute shader. The command list must be in a good state, where objects like descriptor heaps, the root signature, root parameters, and descriptor tables are bound.
Launching the graph requires calling SetProgram
on the command list first. This call specifies the graph to launch, its backing memory, and additional launch flags, if needed.
One important flag is D3D12_SET_WORK_GRAPH_FLAG_INITIALIZE
. This flag must be passed the first time a work graph uses its backing memory. Subsequent launches can omit this flag as long as the backing memory was not used by something other than the graph itself.
Finally, call DispatchGraph
. At this point, it’s possible to specify the input records for the root of the graph. Such records can be fed from CPU or GPU memory.
For reference, the sample code’s LoadWorkGraphPipelines
and PopulateDeferredShadingWorkGraph
functions show and explain each step in the entire CPU-side setup process.
Expressing algorithms with work graphs
It is important to understand how work graphs operate and what their capabilities and limitations are. With this understanding, you can take any algorithm and decide how to express it as a work graph in the most efficient manner.
Work graphs promote data flow and transformation operations. That is, independent data that must flow through a number of steps, transforming and potentially expanding along the way to the final result.
Considerations when working with this version of work graphs include the following:
- With the exception of the root input records, concrete numbers, or upper limits, must be specified for work size and potential expansions in the graph. For example, a broadcast launch node must either use a fixed dispatch grid size, or provide an upper limit for it. As a developer, you must be able to derive those numbers from the algorithm and the potential size of its inputs.
- A node may only take one input record type. Multiple input record types are not allowed. This means a single node cannot be a “join” target of different producers. While it is possible to work around this and manually implement such joins, I suggest avoiding it. Such joins imply that data records linger in the graph’s execution memory until all input records become ready and the join target can launch. Note that coalescing nodes are not suitable to solve this, as their launch condition doesn’t guarantee the number of input records, and may launch with a lower number.
- A graph may not contain any loops, with one exception: a node can loop to itself.
- The graph may not go deeper than 32 nodes. A node’s maximum number of self-loops is also counted against this number.
- Nodes cannot yet produce draw calls, but keep in mind that
TraceRayInline
can be used. - Resources cannot transition to different states during the execution of the work graph.
Conclusion
Work graphs in the Direct3D 12 API help to solve some well-known problems, and enable new creative ideas. In this post, I explained the different launch nodes and how to pass data through records. I also discussed HLSL code for a work graph, as well as the steps involved in launching a work graph from the CPU. Finally, I covered the mental model behind this feature, and how best to map GPU algorithms to it, given certain limitations on this version of work graphs.

Medtronic collaborates with NVIDIA to drive AI advancements in the detection of colorectal cancer
Last year, Medtronic and Cosmo Intelligent Medical Devices announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to build a new AI platform for GI Genius™, the first AI-powered endoscopy module. The use of AI in healthcare is growing significantly, spurred in part by such collaborations between companies like Medtronic and NVIDIA.
For NVIDIA’s perspective on the future of AI and healthcare technology, we spoke with Kimberly Powell, the company’s vice president of healthcare, who shared why she believes the technology can serve as a healthcare “co-pilot” for everyone, including patients and doctors.
Note: This interview was edited for length and clarity.
Why is NVIDIA investing in healthcare?
When I started with NVIDIA, one of the very first phone calls I made was to a company that’s well known for building CT scanners. One thing the healthcare technology industry focuses on is seeing inside the body, and medical devices can generate massive amounts of visual data. That data must be processed and turned into something humans can read. That’s where we come in. NVIDIA accelerated computing is capable of processing data very, very fast, and now we can apply AI applications of all kinds to enhance the information coming from sources like medical instruments and health records. Beyond providing computing platforms, NVIDIA and its partners are enabling the shift toward holistic patient care by augmenting healthcare providers’ operational and clinical care capabilities. NVIDIA has been working in healthcare for over a decade, and we are certain this is an industry in which we’re making a difference and to which we can continue contributing significantly.
Why did NVIDIA partner with Medtronic?
Medtronic, a world leader in healthcare technology, recognized early that AI can be a co-pilot in healthcare. By overlaying AI as an assistant to healthcare professionals, they can catch issues earlier and make sure patients have the best outcomes. NVIDIA is building computing platforms that can help healthcare companies achieve their goals and benefit patients.
Since NVIDIA began collaborating with Medtronic, I’ve learned a lot about colorectal cancer and how to use technology to help reduce the miss rates of polyps. Colorectal cancer is the number one cancer killer of men in the U.S., so, well, I can’t think of anything more meaningful to work on than that.
How will the integration of NVIDIA’s platform help improve the detection of colorectal polyps?
The computing platform that we’ve built with Medtronic can deliver AI at scale, bringing this capability to more places in the world and helping doctors with the early detection of colorectal cancer during real-time colonoscopies. Also, the platform can deliver many AI applications to expand the functionality of the device. It all comes down to the software and the ease of updates. I always go back to smartphones and how they continuously improve with over-the-air updates. It’s a similar case with the platform we’ve created for the GI Genius™ intelligent endoscopy system.
Recently Medtronic conducted a significant survey about how Americans feel about AI. Overall, it showed that Americans are very optimistic about certain applications of AI, such as diagnosing diseases. But it also noted some skepticism. Do you see that changing in the future with the evolution of technology?
With ChatGPT, everybody can experience AI in some shape or form, and that’s going to build consumer trust. We helped make this huge AI moment possible by building computers that enable those AI applications to be trained and deployed at scale, so, for example, even my eight-year-old daughter can interact with an AI. Grandparents, too, are talking about how they use ChatGPT. If you sit back and think about how it has stunned you personally, just as a consumer of technology, you might think to yourself, “Why wouldn’t I want every doctor to have this type of capability at their fingertips?”
I go back to this idea of AI as a co-pilot. It’s an assistant. It helps people automate tasks that might not leverage their skillsets. It helps bring together information in one place, in a given amount of time, which may not have been possible otherwise. It’s not about completely automating all processes. It's about augmenting them. And I think that if the world can really understand that, people will want the augmentation, these skills, the second pair of eyes, these co-pilots. They would want these tools to be at every clinician’s disposal, because it’s going to be what transforms their work, what elevates their craft. I don’t know why we wouldn’t all be chomping at the bit to get more of this going and out there in the world.
Important Safety Information:
GI Genius™ system is intended to be used as an adjunct to colonoscopy procedures and is not intended to replace endoscopist assessment or histopathological sampling. GI Genius™ system does not make any elaboration or alteration of the colonoscopy video streaming, it only overlays graphical markers.
- Danger: Do not use this system for any purpose other than its intended use.
- Danger: The system does not perform any diagnosis.
- Caution: The sale, distribution, and the use of the GI Genius™ system are restricted to prescription use in accordance with 21 CFR 801.109.
- Caution: The device is not intended to be used as a stand-alone diagnostic device.
- Caution: The device is not intended to characterize lesions in a manner that would potentially replace biopsy sampling.
- Caution: The device is not intended to replace clinical decision-making.
- Caution: The device is not intended to be used with equipment that was not tested against during validation activities.
- Caution: The device has not been studied in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), history of CRC, or previous colonic resection. The device performance may be negatively impacted by mucosal irregularities such as background inflammation from certain underlying disease.
- Caution: Users should be aware, when using automated systems such as the GI Genius™ that provide assistance in identifying suspicious lesions, that a high level of reliance may be placed on the system output, potentially leading to user complacency and a bias towards accepting the system output results, rather than using the device as intended. The device is intended to provide adjunctive information to the endoscopist who performs endoscopic evaluations with an expected high level of clinical expertise. Placing too much reliance on the system in this way may lead to an unacceptably low level of procedural oversight ('situational awareness'), sub-par evaluation of the patient, and eventual endoscopist skill degradation, following which retraining may be necessary.
- Danger: Using incompatible equipment can result in patient injury or equipment damage and makes it impossible to obtain the expected functionality.

Find the Next Blockbuster with NVIDIA BioNeMo Framework on Amazon SageMaker
The NVIDIA BioNeMo framework accelerates drug discovery by giving researchers access to powerful foundation models (FMs) for biology. By integrating BioNeMo with Amazon SageMaker, researchers can develop cutting-edge AI solutions with the scalability, data security, and operational excellence they expect from AWS.
Introduction
Drug R&D is a long, costly, and risky process. On average, it takes about 12 years and costs over $2 billion to bring a new drug to market. To combat high failure rates and bring differentiated therapeutics to market faster, pharmaceutical companies are looking to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).
Recent advances in generative AI have led to breakthroughs in foundation models (FMs) for proteins, small molecules, and nucleic acids. After training on massive amounts of data, these models develop internal representations of sequences, structures, and evolutionary relationships. Scientists can then adapt them for applications like predicting molecular structures, identifying protein-ligand docking pockets, and screening for chemical properties.
The NVIDIA BioNeMo framework is a generative AI platform designed for drug discovery. It provides versatile capabilities for training and fine-tuning large language models to understand protein, small molecule, and nucleic acid data. At re:Invent 2023, AWS and NVIDIA announced support for BioNeMo on several AWS services, including Amazon SageMaker, AWS ParallelCluster, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service. Life science teams can now use scalable compute resources on AWS with the BioNeMo framework to rapidly build AI solutions for biomolecular data.
In this post, we’ll explore how customers can leverage the BioNeMo framework on Amazon SageMaker to enhance and accelerate drug R&D. You can find model training and inference code examples on GitHub.
Challenges to Applying Generative AI to Drug Discovery
Early-stage drug development involves target discovery and validation, lead generation and screening, lead optimization, and candidate selection for preclinical development. Each of these stages has unique requirements for AI systems. To improve adoption of these tools, some foundation model developers have openly released pre-trained checkpoints for the scientific community. This includes popular models such as ESM and OpenFold. However, the accuracy of these models can decrease when the training and inference data come from different distributions. This can occur, for example, when predicting the characteristics of monoclonal antibodies or proteins designed de novo.
Fine-tuning these models on use case-specific datasets can improve accuracy. However, this requires large amounts of protein sequence, chemical structure, DNA/RNA sequence, assay data, images, text, and other data. This information is often spread across internal data lakes and external repositories and requires manual curation and cleaning. Instead of building these workloads from scratch researchers need efficient platforms to pre-train, fine-tune, integrate, and serve various ML models for drug discovery.
Solution: NVIDIA BioNeMo Framework on Amazon SageMaker
The BioNeMo framework on Amazon SageMaker combines the performance and accessibility of BioNeMo framework modules with the flexibility, security, and service integrations of SageMaker.
Figure 1: This image shows the workflow for developing models on NVIDIA BioNeMo. The process is divided into phases for model development and customization and then fine-tuning and deployment.
The key capabilities include:
Optimized performance: Enhanced hyperparameter and checkpoint management, along with data and model parallelism, enables near-linear scaling efficiency across hundreds of GPUs.
Growing Model Catalog: The BioNeMo framework contains a growing list of model architectures optimized and maintained by NVIDIA. Examples include models for generating protein and DNA sequence embeddings (ESM1nv, ESM2nv, ProtT5nv, DNABERT), protein structures (OpenFold), novel small molecules (MegaMolBART), and molecular docking simulations (DiffDock, EquiDock).
Pretraining and fine-tuning foundation models: The BioNeMo framework provides container images and configuration files for training foundation models. This includes low-code options for parallelizing computation across multiple GPUs and nodes. Users can share configuration files and training checkpoints across different BioNeMo environments, such as DGX Cloud on AWS and SageMaker, to better manage capacity.
Accelerated Compute Options: AWS and NVIDIA have been strong partners for over thirteen years. AWS was the first to bring NVIDIA GPUs to the cloud, and the first to offer A100 and H100 GPUs in production. At re:Invent 2023 AWS and NVIDIA introduced P5e instances for large-scale generative AI and G6 instances for fine-tuning and inference workloads. These options ensure that customers can find the right instance types on AWS for their needs.
Fully managed, scalable infrastructure: Amazon SageMaker Model Training reduces the time and cost to train ML models at scale without the need to manage infrastructure. SageMaker can automatically scale training jobs up or down, from one to thousands of GPUs. Since you only pay for what you use, you can manage your training costs more effectively.
Security and Compliance: With NVIDIA BioNeMo on Amazon SageMaker, customers can deploy BioNeMo training and inference workloads into their existing AWS accounts. SageMaker ensures that customer data are encrypted in transit and at rest. You can store model artifacts and training data in encrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets and pass an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to SageMaker notebooks, training jobs, and endpoints to encrypt the attached ML storage volume. SageMaker also supports Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and AWS PrivateLink.
MLOps integration: Amazon SageMaker provides purpose-built tools for machine learning operations (MLOps) to automate and standardize processes across the ML lifecycle. This includes SageMaker Experiments, to track metrics, datasets, and other artifacts related to training jobs. Teams can also use SageMaker Model Registry to track model versions and metadata. Finally, SageMaker Pipelines and Projects brings CI/CD best practices to ML, ensuring the smoothest possible transition from POC to production.
Getting Started
Figure 2: This image shows the architecture for training and deploying AI models using BioNeMo on SageMaker. Engineering teams first must adapt the BioNeMo framework image into SageMaker training and inference containers, hosted in Amazon ECR. Then, researchers create SageMaker training jobs to fine-tune BioNeMo models on their own data. Finally, they deploy the models to inference end points to make predictions.
To get started, sign-in or create a free account at NVIDIA NGC. You can then generate an API key to download the BioNeMo framework model weights, data, and other artifacts. These are sensitive credentials, so we strongly recommend storing them in AWS Secrets Manager!
Next, use the example Dockerfiles to build a BioNeMo training and inference image with SageMaker-specific dependencies. You will need to push these images to a private Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) to use them in SageMaker.
Finally, use one of the example training or inference notebooks to fine-tune a protein language model like ESM or generate sequence embeddings. These notebooks include scripts and configuration files you can modify to fit your use case.
Conclusion
Advances in GenAI are set to revolutionize the traditionally lengthy and expensive drug discovery process. The BioNeMo framework on Amazon SageMaker allows scientists to train and deploy cutting-edge models with the scalability and security they’re used to on AWS.

In fact, as of mid-February, more than a third of the S&P 500 companies that had reported earnings mentioned AI on their conference calls. This is a clear signal that companies are doing everything they can to highlight their AI credentials, whether they're truly meaningful or not.
The undisputed poster child for the AI boom has been Nvidia (NVDA +0.63%). Over the past 12 months, the company's stock has rocketed up 298% as its revenue has tripled. This explosive growth over such a short timeframe likely has investors wondering if they've missed the boat. Let's dig in and see if it's too late to buy Nvidia stock now.
This began with a lull
It wasn't that long ago that Nvidia appeared to be struggling and the market sentiment was sour. In three consecutive quarters at the end of 2022 and the beginning of 2023, Nvidia posted negative year-over-year revenue growth and its stock was down 66% from its late-2021 high.
NASDAQ: NVDA
Key Data Points
For those who follow Nvidia, this lull was not unexpected. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, and Nvidia's second-largest segment at the time, gaming, was experiencing weakness. Pandemic lockdowns in China and slow computer sales resulted in a Q3 2023 (the quarter ending in October 2022) year-over-year revenue decline of 51%.
In that same quarter, Nvidia's largest segment, data centers, was up 31%. This increase was aided by cloud service providers and other industries, but in a sign of the times, there was no mention of AI. That boom was yet to come.
The AI revolution
In May 2023, Nvidia reported its results for the quarter ending in April (its Q1 of fiscal 2024). While overall revenue increased by 19%, the guidance for Q2 kicked off the AI revolution. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted generative AI as one of the two transitions the computer industry was going through, and Nvidia's Q2 outlook was the data to back it up.
After posting revenue of $7.2 billion in Q1, Nvidia forecast Q2 revenue of $11 billion, driven by data center demand for chips used for AI. This guidance represented a year-over-year revenue increase of 100%, and we were off to the races. The next three quarters did not disappoint.

Is it too late to buy Nvidia?
At first glance, it would make perfect sense to think the stock's recent run-up has pushed its valuation beyond the point of considering, and that could be the case for some. However, it's worth looking a little deeper into the numbers.
Currently, Nvidia trades for 78 times trailing earnings (P/E), which is very expensive. However, its growth rate is expected to continue, so on a forward basis, it only trades for 38 times earnings. That's still expensive, but when you compare it to its closest AI competitor, Microsoft, it looks more reasonable.
This is still an expensive multiple for either company, but there's good reason to believe Nvidia's growth will outpace Microsoft's, so one could make the argument that Nvidia is the smarter choice. That said, it's important to remember that forward earnings multiples are based on expectations and nobody knows for sure what will happen.
Nvidia could continue to reward shareholders, but patient investors may also benefit from waiting until the red-hot AI rush starts to cool. This is, after all, a cyclical industry, and the cycle should eventually turn around, providing better buying opportunities.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/12/is-it-too-late-to-buy-nvidia-stock-now/

Aclara Technologies — acquired by electronics giant Hubbell Inc. in 2017 — will be the first meter maker to embed the technology, which combines Nvidia’s chip and Jetson platform with Utilidata’s distributed AI software.
- The top line: The announcement marks the first hardware partnership for Utilidata’s Nvidia-powered distributed AI platform, Karman, and will ultimately provide real-time insights into what is happening on the grid. Utilities tend to be reticent about betting on new products and entrants, Aclara’s new meter has the experience of well-established players in hardware, chips, and artificial intelligence behind it — players that have been actively aligning themselves with influential companies and organizations in the utility sector.
- The market grounding: Smart meters are hardly new to the grid. In 2009, nearly $8 billion in funding went to implement advanced metering infrastructure in the U.S., leading to the installation of more than 100 million smart meters. While those initial AMI rollouts received mixed reviews, a new generation of meters that integrate advanced technology like AI is beginning to be deployed. In 2019, for instance, Landis+Gyr and Sense Energy Monitoring partnered to put AI in smart meters, which are still being rolled out in the Northeast. Utilidata estimates that around 50 million meters in the country are nearing the end of their useful lifetimes, which means utilities are once again looking to replace them.
- The current take: Utilidata president and COO Jess Melanson said that deployment of the meter-embedded chip will open up new applications of AI for utilities without pushing them too far out of their comfort zones: “This is a really significant leap forward in terms of compute, in terms of AI capabilities, and in terms of a company like Nvidia turning their focus to the electric grid,” he said. “[Utilities] can buy AI products from AI experts and hardware products from hardware experts, and have a really integrated, effective solution.”
Nvidia and Utilidata announced their partnership almost exactly a year ago, promising to develop and deploy a “lower-cost, lower-power module to deliver real-time AI at the edge of the grid.” The pair’s chip uses a combination of on-chip and cloud-based software, plus distributed AI, to collect real-time data and manage distributed energy resources.
Several thousand units of the first product to stem from that partnership — a “meter collar” that can be added to existing meters — are set to be deployed this year.
But for utility customers, Melanson said, there are some major benefits of a combined electric meter and distributed AI module. That’s where the embedded version of Karman comes in, via an implementation with Aclara’s existing residential meter, which the companies say will provide utilities with 100 times more processing power than traditional solutions.
“Utilities did say they appreciated the flexibility that the collar gave them in terms of doing a deployment without having to think about billing,” Melanson told Latitude Media. “But at scale, as we start thinking about getting into 10% of the endpoints or more at a utility, there seemed to be a preference for the meter-embedded version.”
Beyond pilot programs
Melanson said Utilidata is currently in discussions with existing Karman customers, including Portland General Electric, ComEd, and Duquesne Light Company, about which product they’ll deploy. Those three companies received awards from the Department of Energy in October, in part to fund the deployment of over 150,000 Karman units.
Generally speaking, though, the meter-embedded product is for scaled projects, while early-stage deployments will continue with the meter adaptor.
The partnership with Aclara isn’t exclusive on either side, which, according to Melanson, reflects Utilidata’s desire to give utilities more choice: “Utilities should be able to pick their favorite hardware and their favorite distributed AI platform, and those may well come from different companies,” he said.
Nor is the Aclara meter the end of the road for the partnership. Melanson said Utilidata is currently in discussions to embed the module in other types of hardware in Hubbell’s massive portfolio, which, in addition to smart meters, includes everything from electric vehicle charging products and line construction hardware to demand response units and panelboards.
And while many utilities have been dipping a toe into AI-powered pilots that range from virtual power plant deployments to EV charging analytics, Melanson said the installation of Utilidata’s module will help to ensure utilities don’t have to spend the first few months of a pilot organizing and filling in missing data points. Instead, they’ll be able to focus on getting better at using that data — including by applying machine learning and AI models.
“Those are huge foundational capabilities that will drive better outcomes through all those projects, and accelerate the speed, so we don’t get stuck in pilot cycles for too long,” Melanson said. “We are all on the clock — the changes on the grid are underway and moving at a consumer-driven and market-driven pace.”
Today’s innovations therefore have to focus on enabling utilities to move more quickly than they typically have, and a team-up that combines and packages the skills of three known, trusted companies, targets that exact need, he added: “To me, that’s the huge opportunity for acceleration here, accelerating the speed with which we’re getting experts doing their thing on the electric grid.”",https://www.latitudemedia.com/news/aclara-joins-nvidia-and-utilidata-in-bringing-ai-to-the-smart-meter/

Nvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang has caused consternation with a recent proclamation that people will not need to learn how to program with advances in AI.
AI can generate code to solve specific problems; that is already proven. But at a fundamental level, Nvidia is rethinking the underlying software stack that helps AI generate code that humans need.
Huang’s idea: For decades, the world has been held hostage to conventional computing around CPUs, in which humans would write applications to retrieve prepared information in databases.
“The way that we do computing today, the information was written by someone, created by someone, it’s basically pre-recorded,” Huang said in a sit-down session last week at Stanford University.
Nvidia’s GPUs opened a path for accelerated computing to a more algorithmic style of computing, in which creative reasoning — not logic — helps determine outcomes.
“Why program in Python? In the future, you will tell the computer what you want,” Huang said.
Programming in the Future
Pundits are predicting that, five years from now, information in the forms of text, images, video, and voice will all be fed real-time to large language models (LLMs). The computer will continuously improve itself from all the information feeds and multimodal interactions.
“In the future, we’ll have continuous learning. We could decide whether that continuous learning result will be deployed,” Huang said. “The way you interact with the computer is not going to be C++,” Huang said.
That is where AI comes in — people will reason and ask computers to generate code to meet specific objectives. That will require people to speak to computers in plain language, not in C++ or Python.
“My point is that programming has changed in a way that is probably less valuable,” Huang said, adding that AI has closed the technology divide of humanity.
“Today, about 10 million people are gainfully employed because we know how to program computers, which leaves the other 8 billion behind. That is not true in the future,” Huang said.
English Is the New Programming Language
Huang said the English language will be the most powerful programming language, and human-scale interaction is a key ingredient in closing the tech gap.
Generative AI will be more of an operating system, and humans can tell computers in plain language to create applications. Large language models (LLMs) will help humans run their ideas through computers, Huang said.
For example, humans are already able to tell LLMs to generate Python code for specific domain applications, and all of it in plain English.
“How do you make a computer do what you want it to do? How do you fine-tune the instructions with that computer? That’s called prompt engineering. There is an artistry to that,” Huang said.
People can focus on knowledge and domain expertise, and generative AI will fill in the programming gap. That will impact the software development landscape, Huang said.
Huang previously likened LLMs to college grads who were pre-trained to be super smart. Nvidia is surrounding large models with specialized knowledge in areas such as health care and finance, which could support enterprises.
There are about $1 trillion worth of data centers, which will more than double over the next four to five years to $4 trillion to $5 trillion, Huang said. Nvidia’s GPUs touch almost every AI installation and application.
Don’t Dismiss Nvidia’s CEO
Huang’s prognostications in the past have paid dividends. He is credited with being an AI pioneer — he steered the engineering of Nvidia GPUs so that decades-old AI theories could be put to work.
Nvidia’s stranglehold over the AI market has pushed the company’s valuation to around $2 trillion, and the company is poised for a historic year after a groundbreaking 2024.
GPU sales catapulted company revenue to $22.1 billion for the fourth quarter, a staggering 265% increase from last year’s same quarter. Revenue for 2024 was up by 126% to $60.9 billion compared to 2023.
In the early 2000s, Nvidia was hawking GPUs for gaming. Huang realized that vector processing units could be used for larger modeling and simulations needed in scientific computing. He created the CUDA software stack in 2007 for accelerated computing, and it is now a central ingredient in Nvidia’s AI dominance.
Nvidia App Dev Approach
AI makes it possible for users to talk with different types of data in the form of text, images, and voice. The different data types need a new software stack and accelerators like GPUs to work reasonably well.
NVidia’s CUDA GPU drrver software provides the core foundation of tools to communicate with the GPU. It includes a programming model, development tools, and a large array of libraries. AI developers are using the CUDA primitives to exploit Nvidia GPU capabilities.
CUDA also has tools that automate coding for people to run applications on GPUs. Nvidia is creating universal translators that can take in queries, run a few lines of Python code, and pass it through the selected AI models.
Nvidia’s CUDA is disassembling traditional software development models where applications were written for CPUs. The AI landscape has new types of data, algorithms, and compute engines, and the GPU replaces the CPU, which is ill-equipped at handling complex problems.
But there are similarities between Nvidia’s AI stack and the so-called x86 Wintel platforms. If an AI was trained on an Nvidia GPU, it will also mostly require Nvidia hardware for inferencing. But that could change as AI companies like Microsoft and Meta start deploying their own AI hardware.
Nvidia’s Structure Lines up
Nvidia’s business structure reflects the way it expects AI to supplement human interaction with computers: by the data types and domain knowledge.
The company has pre-built CUDA tools to work with all types of models. For example, it has an auto business that includes all the hardware and software components needed for companies to build autonomous cars. Its health business helps doctors use AI to interact with medical data by fusing images, patient reports, and voice inputs.
Nvidia calls its AI Enterprise Suite the “AI operating system.” The software includes LLMs like NeMo, compilers, libraries, and development stacks. But companies will need Nvidia’s GPUs.
The stack is populated with additional intermediate steps that address some of AI’s thorny issues. For example, a tool called Guardrails can analyze LLM output to prevent hate speech and keep conversations on track. That depends on the rules set out by the owner. These applications can be developed using the LangChain framework.
Nvidia’s larger goal with its stack is to get rid of the command line altogether and provide interactive prompting techniques to interact with databases. That does not have much to do with the software stack, but it plays a role in how search is changing to provide more relevant information — the what, how, when, and why — to users.
Huang is selling subscription packages for its AI software as the company switches gears to a software-sells-hardware strategy, a complete flip of its past hardware-sells-software strategy. Nvidia hopes to sell more software that runs only on its GPUs.
Developer Impact
Huang said programmers will still be needed for its CUDA framework, and for general-purpose computing applications that do not need GPUs.
But his message was clear: the future is AI, and developers need to quickly adapt their skillset to the changing landscape.
Nvidia has come up with the concept of an AI factory, which ingests data as raw materials and spits out processed data as the final product. Nvidia has established solid partnerships with all cloud providers and software providers like Google, Snowflake, Salesforce, Oracle, and VMware.
Nvidia is a lone wolf trying to change the software stack with its proprietary hardware and software platform. But rivals are catching up fast — AMD’s ROCm and Intel’s OneAPI are open-source options that are gaining traction. Google is developing its own software and hardware stack to power its AI infrastructure.
Nvidia’s next developer conference, GTC, will be coming later this month. There are basic seminars on how to write CUDA programs, sessions about AI implementations from companies like X (formerly known as Twitter), and talks about opportunities for developers in AI.
Huang’s keynote will lead off the show.",https://thenewstack.io/nvidia-wants-to-rewrite-the-software-development-stack/

Though the stock dived more than 5% on Friday and by another 2% on Monday, it's still up this year by around 73%. In fact, many are still bullish on Nvidia, giving more upside to its shares. But after a heady year of exploding revenue and profit projections, some may start to question the long-term sustainability of its growth rate. Is it time to take profit, even if only partially — or should investors stay the course? Here's what those who currently hold Nvidia shares are doing — or planning to do — with their positions. Sell at least some Some are saying it's time to sell or that they have already sold part of their Nvidia shares. Vahan Janjigian, chief investment officer at U.S.-based Greenwich Wealth Management, says he had a ""big position"" in Nvidia until recently. ""But I got a little nervous because I do think the stock is overvalued, especially when you look at it on a price to sales basis. It's selling for about 35 times sales, which is very high compared to some of the other technology companies,"" he told CNBC's "" Street Signs Asia "" on Tuesday. ""If you believe that Nvidia can grow its revenues by 30% annually, which I think it can for at least a few years, but it would have to do that for almost 15 years to be able to get back your investment in the stock and that assumes a 100% profit margin,"" he added. Janjigian would rather invest in Nvidia via exchange-traded funds now. He says he has ""rather large"" positions in three of them: the SPDR S & P 500 ETF Trust, Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 and VanEck Semiconductor ETF. He pointed out that Nvidia has a large weightage in all of them, taking up 26% of the VanEck Semiconductor ETF. ""I felt I no longer needed to own the stock individually,"" he said, adding that having both the stock and ETFs gave him ""too much exposure"" to Nvidia. Paul Gambles, managing partner of MBMG Family Office Group, told CNBC Pro on Monday that he'd sell Nvidia right now. Based on history, he said, Nvidia is due for a 50% to 90% decline ""soon."" ""Although whether that happens now or next year is pretty much impossible to tell but precedent would indicate that it's time to be worried – the longest spell without an 'event' was 2012-2018,"" he added. Gambles says investors should have been buying puts when they were cheaper, as the sometimes high volatility of Nvidia is ""potentially ideal"" for options strategies. Options allow you to bet on whether you think an asset is going up or down. You can buy or sell options contracts and implement various strategies. Buying a ""put option"" is profitable for an investor if the market goes down. Conversely, buying a ""call option"" pays if the market goes up. It can be a risky way to invest and therefore suited to sophisticated investors. Here's how it works. ""If they're unprotected and holding NVDA, and if the pricing now makes puts unattractive today, then they should probably devise an exit/profit-taking/position management strategy with a ladder of limit sells and stop-losses,"" Gambles said. A ""limit sell"" will typically attempt to sell the stock at a certain price, and ""stop losses"" means putting in orders to immediately sell off the shares to cut losses when the price drops below a certain price. Laddering in this context refers to a strategy of putting in some sell orders at various price points. ""Even if we're right on the fall, it's up +100% in 6 months so while that momentum continues, you don't want to be making knee-jerk exits but holding NVDA is playing with fire right now,"" Gambles said. Jordan Cvetanovski, portfolio manager at Sydney-based Pella Funds Management, told CNBC Pro he has already taken profit on some Nvidia shares — and did so even before the recent declines. 'Do some rebalancing' There're definitely ""some alarm bells that there is so much euphoria,"" Cvetanovski said. ""So there is potentially a situation where things have been overboard, but only from just a trading perspective, but long term, I'm not concerned."" ""But in the short term, I'm a little bit concerned. So we've taken a little bit off the table, but not as big as you would expect,"" he said. Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, is another one who isn't so optimistic on Nvidia. He says the stock has gone ""parabolic,"" meaning its momentum — or the velocity and speed of price increases — has accelerated. ""People are going to have to do some rebalancing. And as that action happens, you can certainly lose some of the momentum. I think it's a great company, but it's sort of a dangerous stock to be jumping into after moves this large in such a short period of time,"" he told CNBC's "" Worldwide Exchange "" on Monday. Stick with it Louis Navellier of Navellier and Associates is still fairly bullish, and says it's definitely not time to sell any Nvidia shares yet. ""No, no, because I don't have other companies with 200% sales growth. And it is trading about 26 times forecasted earnings and it's a monopoly,"" he told CNBC Pro last week. After Nvidia's selloff, he reiterated his position, saying he has no plans to sell Nvidia. ""There is no reason to take profits in NVDA. It will be a $1,000 stock in the upcoming months."" Navellier thinks Nvidia is ""reasonably priced,"" given its forecast earnings and its ""monopoly"" on graphics processing units in the AI market. ""Obviously, its dominance isn't going to last forever. You will hit a point like Apple is hit where you know, the sales are so sputtering, the margins are not expanding,"" he said. ""But I'm going to ride it as long as the sales are strong and the margins are expanding.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/13/sell-nvidia-or-stick-with-it-heres-what-investors-say.html

We are sharing details on the hardware, network, storage, design, performance, and software that help us extract high throughput and reliability for various AI workloads. We use this cluster design for Llama 3 training.
- We are strongly committed to open compute and open source. We built these clusters on top of Grand Teton, OpenRack, and PyTorch and continue to push open innovation across the industry.
- This announcement is one step in our ambitious infrastructure roadmap. By the end of 2024, we’re aiming to continue to grow our infrastructure build-out that will include 350,000 NVIDIA H100 GPUs as part of a portfolio that will feature compute power equivalent to nearly 600,000 H100s.
To lead in developing AI means leading investments in hardware infrastructure. Hardware infrastructure plays an important role in AI’s future. Today, we’re sharing details on two versions of our 24,576-GPU data center scale cluster at Meta. These clusters support our current and next generation AI models, including Llama 3, the successor to Llama 2, our publicly released LLM, as well as AI research and development across GenAI and other areas .
A peek into Meta’s large-scale AI clusters
Meta’s long-term vision is to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is open and built responsibly so that it can be widely available for everyone to benefit from. As we work towards AGI, we have also worked on scaling our clusters to power this ambition. The progress we make towards AGI creates new products, new AI features for our family of apps, and new AI-centric computing devices.
While we’ve had a long history of building AI infrastructure, we first shared details on our AI Research SuperCluster (RSC), featuring 16,000 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, in 2022. RSC has accelerated our open and responsible AI research by helping us build our first generation of advanced AI models. It played and continues to play an important role in the development of Llama and Llama 2, as well as advanced AI models for applications ranging from computer vision, NLP, and speech recognition, to image generation, and even coding.
Under the hood
Our newer AI clusters build upon the successes and lessons learned from RSC. We focused on building end-to-end AI systems with a major emphasis on researcher and developer experience and productivity. The efficiency of the high-performance network fabrics within these clusters, some of the key storage decisions, combined with the 24,576 NVIDIA Tensor Core H100 GPUs in each, allow both cluster versions to support models larger and more complex than that could be supported in the RSC and pave the way for advancements in GenAI product development and AI research.
Network
At Meta, we handle hundreds of trillions of AI model executions per day. Delivering these services at a large scale requires a highly advanced and flexible infrastructure. Custom designing much of our own hardware, software, and network fabrics allows us to optimize the end-to-end experience for our AI researchers while ensuring our data centers operate efficiently.
With this in mind, we built one cluster with a remote direct memory access (RDMA) over converged Ethernet (RoCE) network fabric solution based on the Arista 7800 with Wedge400 and Minipack2 OCP rack switches. The other cluster features an NVIDIA Quantum2 InfiniBand fabric. Both of these solutions interconnect 400 Gbps endpoints. With these two, we are able to assess the suitability and scalability of these different types of interconnect for large-scale training, giving us more insights that will help inform how we design and build even larger, scaled-up clusters in the future. Through careful co-design of the network, software, and model architectures, we have successfully used both RoCE and InfiniBand clusters for large, GenAI workloads (including our ongoing training of Llama 3 on our RoCE cluster) without any network bottlenecks.
Compute
Both clusters are built using Grand Teton, our in-house-designed, open GPU hardware platform that we’ve contributed to the Open Compute Project (OCP). Grand Teton builds on the many generations of AI systems that integrate power, control, compute, and fabric interfaces into a single chassis for better overall performance, signal integrity, and thermal performance. It provides rapid scalability and flexibility in a simplified design, allowing it to be quickly deployed into data center fleets and easily maintained and scaled. Combined with other in-house innovations like our Open Rack power and rack architecture, Grand Teton allows us to build new clusters in a way that is purpose-built for current and future applications at Meta.
We have been openly designing our GPU hardware platforms beginning with our Big Sur platform in 2015.
Storage
Storage plays an important role in AI training, and yet is one of the least talked-about aspects. As the GenAI training jobs become more multimodal over time, consuming large amounts of image, video, and text data, the need for data storage grows rapidly. The need to fit all that data storage into a performant, yet power-efficient footprint doesn’t go away though, which makes the problem more interesting.
Our storage deployment addresses the data and checkpointing needs of the AI clusters via a home-grown Linux Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) API backed by a version of Meta’s ‘Tectonic’ distributed storage solution optimized for Flash media. This solution enables thousands of GPUs to save and load checkpoints in a synchronized fashion (a challenge for any storage solution) while also providing a flexible and high-throughput exabyte scale storage required for data loading.
We have also partnered with Hammerspace to co-develop and land a parallel network file system (NFS) deployment to meet the developer experience requirements for this AI cluster. Among other benefits, Hammerspace enables engineers to perform interactive debugging for jobs using thousands of GPUs as code changes are immediately accessible to all nodes within the environment. When paired together, the combination of our Tectonic distributed storage solution and Hammerspace enable fast iteration velocity without compromising on scale.
The storage deployments in our GenAI clusters, both Tectonic- and Hammerspace-backed, are based on the YV3 Sierra Point server platform, upgraded with the latest high capacity E1.S SSD we can procure in the market today. Aside from the higher SSD capacity, the servers per rack was customized to achieve the right balance of throughput capacity per server, rack count reduction, and associated power efficiency. Utilizing the OCP servers as Lego-like building blocks, our storage layer is able to flexibly scale to future requirements in this cluster as well as in future, bigger AI clusters, while being fault-tolerant to day-to-day Infrastructure maintenance operations.
Performance
One of the principles we have in building our large-scale AI clusters is to maximize performance and ease of use simultaneously without compromising one for the other. This is an important principle in creating the best-in-class AI models.
As we push the limits of AI systems, the best way we can test our ability to scale-up our designs is to simply build a system, optimize it, and actually test it (while simulators help, they only go so far). In this design journey, we compared the performance seen in our small clusters and with large clusters to see where our bottlenecks are. In the graph below, AllGather collective performance is shown (as normalized bandwidth on a 0-100 scale) when a large number of GPUs are communicating with each other at message sizes where roofline performance is expected.
Our out-of-box performance for large clusters was initially poor and inconsistent, compared to optimized small cluster performance. To address this we made several changes to how our internal job scheduler schedules jobs with network topology awareness – this resulted in latency benefits and minimized the amount of traffic going to upper layers of the network. We also optimized our network routing strategy in combination with NVIDIA Collective Communications Library (NCCL) changes to achieve optimal network utilization. This helped push our large clusters to achieve great and expected performance just as our small clusters.
In addition to software changes targeting our internal infrastructure, we worked closely with teams authoring training frameworks and models to adapt to our evolving infrastructure. For example, NVIDIA H100 GPUs open the possibility of leveraging new data types such as 8-bit floating point (FP8) for training. Fully utilizing larger clusters required investments in additional parallelization techniques and new storage solutions provided opportunities to highly optimize checkpointing across thousands of ranks to run in hundreds of milliseconds.
We also recognize debuggability as one of the major challenges in large-scale training. Identifying a problematic GPU that is stalling an entire training job becomes very difficult at a large scale. We’re building tools such as desync debug, or a distributed collective flight recorder, to expose the details of distributed training, and help identify issues in a much faster and easier way
Finally, we’re continuing to evolve PyTorch, the foundational AI framework powering our AI workloads, to make it ready for tens, or even hundreds, of thousands of GPU training. We have identified multiple bottlenecks for process group initialization, and reduced the startup time from sometimes hours down to minutes.
Commitment to open AI innovation
Meta maintains its commitment to open innovation in AI software and hardware. We believe open-source hardware and software will always be a valuable tool to help the industry solve problems at large scale.
Today, we continue to support open hardware innovation as a founding member of OCP, where we make designs like Grand Teton and Open Rack available to the OCP community. We also continue to be the largest and primary contributor to PyTorch, the AI software framework that is powering a large chunk of the industry.

Alberque analyzes traffic data for Raleigh, North Carolina, which has seen its population more than double in the past three decades. The city has been working with NVIDIA and its partners to analyze traffic on the roads and intersections to help reduce congestion and enhance pedestrian safety.
“We can now push traffic video into the NVIDIA DeepStream platform and can quantify in real time how many vehicles are entering and exiting intersections and visualize it for our engineers,” said Alberque, a geoinformation systems and emerging technology manager for the city.
Such information can be fed to vendors responsible for keeping traffic lights optimized, so population expansion doesn’t bring roadways to a crawl or increase the number of accidents.
Urban growth has slowed commutes as metropolitan regions across the nation turn to AI for assistance in optimizing traffic flow.
“We got great accuracy level using NVIDIA pre-trained AI computer vision models for traffic cameras right out of the box,” said Alberque. “And our engineers worked with an NVIDIA Metropolis partner, Quantiphi, to refine those models and got them up to an incredible 95% accuracy,” said Alberque.
The Raleigh system uses hundreds of cameras to enhance its model training, and the city has its sights set on everything from road flooding, license plate tracking and parking utilization to bus stop wait times and sanitation management.
Federal Initiatives Support Intersection Safety
Advances from the city of Raleigh and others looking to smooth the flow of traffic come as the U.S. Department of Transportation continues to support AI efforts.
The DOT recently announced winners of the first phase of its Intersection Safety Challenge, which aims to support innovation in intersection safety. Three of the DOT’s winning entrants are harnessing NVIDIA Metropolis for smart intersections.
In this first stage, 15 participants who submitted design concept proposals for intersection safety systems out of 120 submissions were awarded $100,000 each and an invitation to participate further.
The next stage will focus on system assessment and virtual testing, with teams expected to develop, train and improve algorithms used for detection, localization and classification of vehicles and road users in a controlled test intersection.
Enlisting NVIDIA AI for Smart Intersections
Deloitte Consulting is building a foundation for smart intersections, enlisting the NVIDIA Metropolis application framework, developer tools and partner ecosystem.
Derq USA is developing an intersection safety system that relies on NVIDIA Metropolis to help manage the deluge of sensor data for insights.
Metropolis partner, Miovision, which has traffic light safety systems deployed across the U.S., uses the NVIDIA Jetson edge AI platform in its devices for processing video and TensorRT for inference.
“There are so many people moving into our city and surrounding areas, and our number one and number two concerns for citizens are around traffic — this is providing data to move the needle,” said Alberque, regarding Raleigh’s Metropolis and DeepStream development.

Direct3D 12 (D3D12) introduces work graphs as a programming paradigm that enables the GPU to generate work for itself on the fly. For an introduction to work graphs, see Advancing GPU-Driven Rendering with Work Graphs in Direct3D 12.
This post features a Direct3D 12 work graphs case study. I explain how the common deferred shading rendering algorithm can benefit from work graphs’ efficient shader code selection and execution. Then, from this case study, I explore more advanced topics, learnings, and recommendations for work graphs.
Work graphs selective shader code execution
Compared to ExecuteIndirect
, work graphs in the Direct3D 12 (D3D12) API have a unique capability to dynamically choose and launch shaders on a micro-level. For example, consider an operation that partitions the screen into tiles. For each tile, a certain operation must be performed depending on the contents of that tile. Suppose there are 10 possibilities for each tile. You can accomplish this using three different approaches:
- Use an uber shader with a large
switch/case
block that contains code for all possibilities. - Issue full-screen
Dispatch
calls that run a shader specialized for each of the possibilities. The shader first determines whether the tile is about to process matches with the shader. If not, the shader exits immediately. - Start with a pass that classifies the tiles and counts how many tiles there are for each possibility. Then use
ExecuteIndirect
to enable the GPU to adjust the grid size for each of the dispatches.
Each of these approaches comes with its drawbacks. For the first approach, an uber shader often leads to waste in the register file, caused by variables that must be kept alive even if not used for a particular execution path, thus reducing occupancy. There is also some cost due to the branching in the switch/case
block.
The second approach suffers from launching a wasteful number of compute warps in order to cover all possibilities. The third approach sounds most efficient, but introduces a classification pass not present in the first two approaches.
Work graphs offer a more elegant solution. The following case study will show how, including recommendations and useful tools for debugging.
Multi-BRDF deferred shading case study
Deferred shading has been a very common technique for managing lighting and material interactions in a game engine. Typically, meshes in the scene are rasterized into a fat G-buffer that stores shading parameters for each pixel (normal, albedo, and roughness, for example). Then a follow-up lighting pass takes the information from the G-buffer and applies lighting to the contents to produce a lit pixel and stores it in a color buffer, usually in HDR format.
The lighting pass itself is usually accompanied by some acceleration structure that enables the shader to consider only lights that affect the pixel underneath, instead of checking against all light sources in the scene.
This works fine as long as all materials in the scene use the same Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), which can be artistically limiting. To support more than one BRDF (for example, clear-coat, eye, or hair), an additional parameter can be added to the G-buffer to signify the BRDF for each pixel. In addition, the lighting pass must use a switch/case
block on that BRDF value so it knows how to compute the material-light interaction. Does this sound familiar?
I have built a sample around this use case to explore how work graphs could help. The fully documented sample code implements a multi-BRDF deferred shading renderer. Available through NVIDIAGameWorks/donut_examples on GitHub, it showcases two approaches: uber shaders and work graphs.
This sample uses a slim G-buffer layout that stores only the normal and material IDs instead of all material parameters. This makes sense for multi-BRDF materials, as each BRDF could have a different set of parameters to represent a material. During shading, the material type is used to determine the logic for pulling the material parameters and evaluating the material-light interaction.
The scene is made up of multiple dance floors. Each floor is populated by an animated crowd of cuboids. The ceiling is populated with reflective balls that cast moving lights on each floor. Numerous colored moving spotlights also light the scene.
This scene is fully procedurally generated and animated. Several controls manage scene complexity (number of meshes, lights, and materials). Materials can use one of several types (or BRDFs) that render in a certain way (Lambert, Phong, Metallic, or Velvet, for example).
Take your time tweaking the code and trying different scene parameters to see how these changes affect performance.
The standard deferred shading compute pass is done using two compute dispatches:
- Tiled light culling: The screen is divided into tiles that are 8×4 pixels each. For each tile, all lights affecting that tile are collected and stored in a buffer.
- Deferred shading using an uber shader: Each tile is processed again, this time using the lights collected by the tile. All materials found in the tile are evaluated in an uber shader.
Most importantly, this sample implements the same deferred shading pass using work graphs.
The work graph technique completely replaces the two steps mentioned previously. Instead, the graph uses broadcasting launch nodes to replicate the same concept of tiled light culling. The root node of the graph is executed for each screen tile. The node culls lights for the tile, and stores the results in a record to be sent to the next step of the graph.
The root node can target an array of outputs, where each output is specialized for a certain BRDF (or a screen clear). The culled lights list is placed in a record that’s sent to the correct node in the graph that can handle the type of material in the tile. In the case of a tile containing multiple different BRDFs, the root node spawns multiple records to cover the same tile using all the proper nodes.
Performance
On a GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the work graph lights the scene at 1920 x 1080 within 0.8 ms to 0.95 ms, whereas the uber shader dispatch technique takes 0.98 ms. Multiple factors lead to these results, as detailed below.
- Work graph execution is not free. There is a cost associated with managing the graph’s records and scheduling work. This cost eats some of the gains the work graphs achieved.
- Lighting performance using work graphs responds better to screen content. When the screen contains a lot of Sky tiles, the lighting pass finishes faster. In this case, the performance difference between a screen full of meshes and a screen half-full of meshes (depending on the view) is about 0.2 ms. The uber shader performance does not respond as well to screen content. It demonstrates mostly stable time regardless of view.
- Node shaders in the work graph are specialized to handle one BRDF each, whereas the uber shader must handle all possible BRDFs. The node shaders thus have a better chance of compiler optimizations.
- BRDF node shaders can launch as soon as the root node has classified the tile. The uber shader technique involves two dispatches separated by a resource barrier, which means the second dispatch can only launch after the first dispatch is fully complete.
These results portray one of the lessons I learned during my adventures with work graphs. That is, the performance gains must outweigh the overhead cost of work graph execution in order to see a net win in performance. The sample shows how the deferred shading pass can benefit from work graphs, even though this version of work graphs is limited to compute shaders only.
Content streaming game engines
This section explores how a renderer that uses work graphs could support large-scale game worlds. Consider an engine that enables artists to author material shaders. The concept of multi-BRDF simply becomes applicable on the material itself, where each material has a shader of its own that executes its unique computations—and even the BRDF altogether.
A problem can arise when materials are loaded gradually with the rest of the game’s content as the player is progressing or moving across different parts of the game world in a seamless manner. This is commonly referred to as content streaming. From a graphics programming perspective, it involves loading resources on the fly, including textures, meshes, and materials.
In the scheme of a single work graph handling all materials of the scene, how can the graph grow to handle more materials as the need arises during runtime?
A naive approach would be to fully rebuild the HLSL code of the graph and inject the new material’s shader code into it. Not only does this lead to a whole bunch of extremely slow string operations, but the cost of compilation could be too high to hide, resulting in strong stutters in gameplay. Avoid this approach.
A less naive approach is to completely recreate the graph, with the addition of precompiled DXIL libraries for the new materials.
The ideal approach is to use the AddToStateObject
API to support streaming scenarios in ray tracing applications. Work graphs make it easy to extend the nodes that could be targeted by any certain producer thanks to sparse node output arrays.
In this case, it would be possible to have the node responsible for material classification to declare its target outputs as a sparse output array. Each output of the array maps to a node representing a specific material shader, and those nodes are indexed by an integer value that can be chosen dynamically. Refer to the DirectX Specs to learn how to use this feature.
Recommendations
After spending some time with work graphs, I have collected a list of learnings and recommendations that should help make the process more fun, and reduce unhappy surprises.
- When designing or adapting existing algorithms to work graphs, understand the mental model of data being communicated from top to bottom, driving work that can potentially expand.
- Work graphs excel in their ability to execute different shaders according to different conditions. Avoid uber shader nodes. Instead, break such shaders down into individual, simpler, specialized node shaders. Such specialized shaders benefit from reduced register pressure and less chance of divergent execution.
- Aim for node shaders that do a considerable amount of work rather than a small set of operations. Otherwise, the cost of the work graph will be dominated by its execution overhead.
- Avoid UAV reads and writes to the same resource in the graph where possible. Such resources require the
globallycoherent
specifier to maintain correctness, but this specifier will also affect access speed considerably on such resources. Embrace communicating work data across nodes using records. - For broadcast launch nodes, if the dispatch size can be determined statically, use
NodeDispatchGrid
attribute to specify the size instead of passing the grid size as anSV_DispatchGrid
value in the input record. Remember that it is possible to overrideNodeDispatchGrid
during work graph creation at runtime to adjust it according to certain runtime conditions like screen resolution and other quality settings. - Try to keep the numbers specified in attributes like
NodeMaxDispatchGrid
andMaxRecords
as tight as possible. Understand the broadcast/coalescing nature at the various nodes of the work graph, and use this understanding to determine good values for work size estimation. This should help reduce the backing memory size required by the graph. - Consider marking node outputs with the
MaxRecordsSharedWith
attribute where possible. One obvious and common case is if a producer node thread will write one output record to only one of its children. - Aim to complete outputting node records as early as possible in the shader and use
OutputComplete
to mark the completion. This gives a better chance for improved occupancy. - Start simple and validate that each step works correctly before adding code to launch the next node. It’s easy to make mistakes, especially when requesting output records. Since work graphs are a new feature, debugging tools are not yet optimal.
Profiling and debugging tools
NVIDIA Nsight Graphics provides comprehensive support for profiling and debugging graphics applications. It exposes the rendering pipeline and visualizes your workloads, helping you identify and solve optimization needs.
You can examine D3D12 work graphs in the Nsight Graphics Frame Debugger, which inspects GPU processes frame by frame. By capturing and replaying work graphs, the Frame Debugger can reveal API parameters, resource bindings, and the contents of memory buffers.
The function DispatchGraph
launches a work graph onto the GPU, and orchestrates how tasks are executed in a graph structure, enabling efficient parallelism and task dependency management. This function is plotted as a timeline event in Nsight Graphics GPU Trace, so you can view GPU performance metrics alongside it.
Future directions
Many algorithms revolve around large amounts of independent data flowing through a series of steps, with expansions occurring at various steps. Algorithms processing hierarchical data stand to be great candidates for work graph implementations. For example, the process of taking a virtual scene, culling it to the visible area, processing and transforming meshes, all up to triangle rasterization. This process can be implemented well in a single work graph.
Although work graphs are currently limited to compute shaders, it is possible to build a specialized rasterizer in compute or even use inline ray tracing. However, this should not be necessary once work graphs add support for submitting triangles to the rasterizer.
Work graphs take a big step toward full GPU-driven frame processing. But it is not yet possible for one work graph to express the work of an entire frame (for example, culling, rasterizing a G-buffer, lighting then postprocessing). While a single work graph can represent multiple steps of the frame’s rendering, there are still some operations that cannot be done efficiently within a single work graph. Questions that arise when operating with such a wide scope include:
- How should resource states be managed during graph execution?
- How can triangles be submitted to the hardware rasterizer? Can further parts of the work graph run following triangle rasterization?
- How can multi-pass algorithms be represented (postprocessing chains, for example)?
Until these questions are resolved, the CPU will continue to play a primary role in frame sequencing. Yet more data-dependent passes can now be moved entirely to the GPU, freeing the CPU from tasks like having to manage scene culling and push commands for every visible entity. So, we are not yet at a point where the CPU can submit just one call to DispatchGraph
to draw the entire frame, but this release of work graphs helps convert more parts of the frame to become GPU-driven, thus reducing the cases where the CPU would be the bottleneck for the application’s performance.
Conclusion
This post has explored a concrete use case that formulates an existing rendering algorithm to benefit from the capabilities of work graphs in Direct3D 12. I also discussed some advanced topics about work graphs, including performance considerations and operation under streaming game engines.

We observed up to a 4.4x speedup in throughput in the open-source tool FFmpeg and up to 37x lower latency at 4K. The acceleration is now officially a part of VMAF 3.0 and FFmpeg v6.1.
The VMAF-CUDA implementation was the result of a successful open-source collaboration between NVIDIA and Netflix. The results of this collaboration are an extended libvmaf API with GPU support, libvmaf CUDA feature extractors, as well as an accompanying upstream FFmpeg filter, libvmaf_cuda. VMAF-CUDA must be built from the source. Use the Dockerfile.cuda container as a reference for all required libraries and steps.
VMAF key elementary metrics
VMAF evaluates video quality using key elementary metrics from a reference and a distorted image:
- Visual information fidelity (VIF): Quantifies the preservation of original content, reflecting perceived information loss.
- Additive distortion measurement (ADM): Assesses structural changes and texture degradation. It is notably sensitive to additive distortions such as noise.
- Motion features: Crucial for appraising motion-rendering quality in dynamic scenes.
These metrics are used as input features for a support vector machine (SVM) regressor, which integrates them to calculate the final VMAF score. This approach ensures a comprehensive and precise representation of video quality, as perceived by viewers.
Feature extractors such as VIF and ADM do not require any prior information. They only require a reference frame and a distorted frame as input. Unlike the other two, the extraction of motion features also requires information from previous motion feature extractor iterations (inter-frame dependency).
VMAF implementation on GPU vs. CPU
The CPU implementation of VMAF can distribute the computation of the above features over multiple threads for each image. Therefore, the VMAF calculation profits from a higher number of CPU cores. The computation of the VMAF score on the CPU implementation is dependent on the slowest feature that must be extracted (Figure 1).
Also, the motion feature score calculation has temporal dependencies and therefore cannot be multi-threaded. So, the VMAF score latency per frame is independent of the number of threads that can be used. Performance profiling has shown that VIF generally requires more time to compute, making it the limiting feature extractor. Nonetheless, a higher number of threads increases the VMAF throughput in frames per second (FPS).
VMAF was recently ported to run on CUDA using NVIDIA GPUs. VMAF-CUDA requires the CUDA Toolkit to compile but does not need any additional libraries for deployment apart from the GPU driver.
VMAF-CUDA uses a different approach when compared to the CPU implementation. Rather than allocating parts of the GPU compute resources for specific feature extractors to compute them concurrently, the CUDA implementation allocates the entire GPU compute resources for each feature and calculates them sequentially (Figure 2).
This results in the faster computation of each feature and makes the VMAF score latency now dependent on the sum of all feature extractors. The CUDA implementation accelerates the feature extractors and is compatible with different VMAF functionalities, such as support for VMAF models VMAF 4K and VMAF NEG.
VMAF-CUDA can be a drop-in replacement for an existing pipeline that uses the VMAF-CPU. If the images are in CPU RAM, they are promptly uploaded to the GPU. The entire GPU implementation consists of feature extractor compute and memory transfers to and from the GPU. It works asynchronously relative to the CPU.
NVIDIA also used VMAF-CUDA as an opportunity to accelerate PSNR calculations. VMAF and PSNR are usually calculated concurrently. Our research pointed to PSNR as the bottleneck if it is run on the CPU along VMAF-CUDA as it requires fetching the decoded image from GPU memory through the PCIe Bus. The PCIe transfer hurts performance significantly due to its limited speed. For this purpose, PSNR can also be calculated on the GPU using the CUDA-accelerated PSNR #1175 patch.
Advantages of VMAF-CUDA
VMAF-CUDA can be used during encoding. NVIDIA GPUs can run compute workloads on GPU cores independent of NVENC and NVDEC. NVENC can consume the raw video frame while NVDEC decodes the output frame into video memory. This implies that both the reference frame and the distorted frame stay in video memory and can be input into VMAF-CUDA (Figure 2). Therefore, VMAF can be computed during the encoding because NVENC does not require the GPU compute resources.
It also can be used during transcoding for quality monitoring. When transcoding an H.264 bitstream to H.265, NVDEC decodes the input bitstream and writes its frame to the GPU VRAM (reference frame). This reference frame is encoded to H.265 using NVENC, which can be directly decoded resulting in the distorted frame. This process leaves compute resources idle while transcoding on the GPU and keeping the data in GPU memory. VMAF-CUDA can use these idle resources and calculate a score without interrupting transcoding and no additional memory transfers. This makes it a cost-effective option compared to the CPU implementation.
VMAF-CUDA is fully integrated with FFmpeg v6.1 and supports GPU frames for hardware-accelerated decoding. FFmpeg is an industry-standard, open-source tool that handles multi-media files and video streams. After building VMAF and FFmpeg from the source, only the latest NVIDIA GPU driver is required for execution and you don’t require any prior knowledge of CUDA.
The usage in a Docker container makes dependency handling and compilation a convenient and portable process. VMAF-CUDA in FFmpeg executes on the GPU asynchronously relative to the CPU, freeing it up to do additional tasks.
Evaluation
There are two metrics we measured with VMAF-CUDA:
- VMAF per frame latency: The time required to compute the three feature extractors to obtain a VMAF score for a single frame reflecting responsiveness.
- Total throughput: How quickly the VMAF score for a video sequence can be computed.
The hardware used for this measurement was a 56C/112T Dual Intel Xeon 8480 compute node and a single NVIDIA L4 GPU.
VMAF latency improvements
The feature extractor latencies on a frame basis were measured using NVIDIA Tools Extension (NVTX) ranges placed inside the VMAF library (libvmaf
) and a Nsight Systems trace was captured using the VMAF tool included in the VMAF GitHub repository.
Latency in this case is the time required to compute the three feature extractors to get a VMAF score for a single frame. NVTX enables you to measure the runtime of functions or operations on CPUs and GPUs. In the measurements, both the CPU and GPU feature extractors run independently for 4K and 1080p test sequences.
The hardware used for this measurement was a 56C/112T Dual Intel Xeon 8480 compute node and an NVIDIA L4 GPU. The measurements showed a 30–90x speedup in feature extractor latencies for one image on the NVIDIA L4 over the Intel Xeon 8480 CPUs (Figure 3).
At lower resolutions like 1080p VMAF-CUDA does not saturate a single NVIDIA L4, which is why you see even better latency improvements compared to VMAF-CPU on higher resolutions like 4K.
Figure 4 shows the average VMAF score access latency.
The NVIDIA L4 GPU latency time is the sum of the average runtime of each feature extractor as they run sequentially on the GPU. The average latency for the Dual Intel Xeon compute node is determined by the slowest feature extractors as they run in parallel on multiple cores. VMAF-CUDA is 36.9x faster at 4K and 26.1x faster at 1080p when accessing the VMAF score of a single frame than the Dual Intel Xeon 8480.
FFmpeg performance improvement
We measured the throughput (FPS) by calculating VMAF in FFmpeg. FFmpeg enables the encoded video to be read into GPU or CPU RAM directly instead of reading the raw byte streams from disk, as the VMAF tool does. We used the libvmaf_cuda
video filter for the GPU implementation and the libvmaf
video filter for the CPU implementation. For input, we used YUV420 8-bit per channel, 4K, and 1080p HEVC encoded test sequences as input.
The following FFmpeg command calculates the VMAF score using the GPU implementation:
ffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda -i distorted.mp4 -hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda -i reference.mp4 -filter_complex ""[0:v]scale_npp=format=yuv420p[dis],[1:v]scale_npp=format=yuv420p[ref],[dis][ref]libvmaf_cuda"" -f null –
-hwaccel cuda -hwaccel_output_format cuda
: Enables CUDA for hardware-accelerated video frames. The video is decoded on the GPU using NVDEC and output to GPU VRAM. This is crucial for high throughput to prevent it from being limited by memory transfers from the CPU.-filter_complex
: Starts a complex filter that describes a video processing pipeline. Each step is a video filter that is comma-separated and starts with the inputs in square brackets.[0:v]scale_npp=format=yuv420p[dis]
: Takes the first input video (distorted.mp4
), here0:v
, and formats it toyuv420
usingscale_npp
, so that it is compatible with VMAF. VMAF supports YUV420, YUV422, and YUV444 in 8–, 10–, or 12-bit, but NVDEC outputs YUV420 as NV12, which requires this reformat. Finally, it stores the result in a variable:dis
. The same goes for the reference input video (reference.mp4
), here1:v
, and stores it inref
.[dis][ref]libvmaf_cuda
: Takes the outputdis
andref
from the previous filters and inputs it into thelibvmaf_cuda
video filter that calculates the VMAF score for both input videos. Contrary to other metrics, the order of inputs here is important, as the metric is not symmetric.
The NVIDIA L4 achieved 178 FPS at 4K and 775 FPS in 1080p while the Dual Intel Xeon 8480 compute node reached 64 FPS for 4K and 176 FPS for 1080p (Figure 5). This is a speedup of 2.8x for the 4K sequence and 2.5x for 1080p when processing a single video stream.
Dollar-cost analysis
For the cost analysis, we based our calculations on a standard 2U server typically found in data centers.
The NVIDIA L4 is designed with a single-slot low-profile form factor allowing for eight NVIDIA L4 units to be housed within a 2U server with cheaper Intel Xeon or AMD Rome processors. A single process/instance of FFmpeg cannot saturate the Dual Intel Xeon 8480 compute node during VMAF computation while the NVIDIA L4 was at 100% usage.
Figure 6 shows the results of a test based on the total compute performance of a 2U Dual Intel Xeon system conducted with multiple processes of FFmpeg to fully saturate the CPUs. The FPS numbers for a 2U eight L4 server are shown as well.
Multiple instances of FFmpeg on Dual Intel Xeon 8480 and eight NVIDIA L4
The Dual Intel Platinum 8480 node has a total throughput of 1034 FPS at 1080p and 235 FPS at 4K with multiple FFmpeg instances/processes. The 2U server system with eight NVIDIA L4 GPUs reached a total throughput of 6200 FPS at 1080p and 1424 FPS at 4K. This is a speedup of ~6x for 1080p and 4K at the same power draw level.
The following table breaks down the cost per VMAF frame for a 2U server.
| NVIDIA L4 | Dual Intel Platinum 84801 | |
| 1000 hours of 4K at 30 FPS | 108M frames | 108M frames |
| Server Type | 2U | 2U |
| # of processors | 8 | 2 |
| Max total throughput | 1424 FPS | 235 FPS |
| Time to calculate VMAF scores | 21.0 hrs | 127.6 hrs |
| 3-year TCO | $30K | $20K |
| Cost to calculate VMAF for 1000 hrs of 4K video at 30 FPS | $24 | $97 |
1CPU-only server (2U chassis, Dual Intel Platinum 8480, 512GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NIC) | L4 server (2U chassis, 2S 32C CPU, 128GB RAM, 1TB SSD, CX6 NIC)
When comparing the eight NVIDIA L4 to the Dual Intel Xeon 8480, the NVIDIA system provides cost savings of up to 75%.
Partner success stories
We want to showcase some of the achievements and experiences of our partners, highlighting their accomplishments using VMAF-CUDA and NVIDIA GPUs in their software and video processing pipelines. The valuable feedback provided by Snap, as a beta tester, significantly contributed to the development of VMAF-CUDA.
Snap
Snap tracks video quality metrics over time, which includes CUDA-accelerated VMAF to ensure that transcode quality is consistent per variant.
They are currently using VMAF-CUDA for Snapchat Memories to determine if a particular encode meets the quality threshold and re-transcode if required. The introduction of VMAF-CUDA has optimized the processing pipeline. Previously, the high computational costs of VMAF calculations deterred Snap from using optimal transcode settings. However, thanks to VMAF-CUDA, they can evaluate Snapchat Memories after each transcode and re-encode with optimized settings with little overhead.
Snap generally observed a 2.5x speedup in processing time, attributing this improvement to the ability to run VMAF calculations exclusively on the GPU. This shift has made it far more cost-effective to run VMAF compared to the CPU-based methods. Snap is using Amazon EC2 g4dn.2xlarge instances with T4 GPUs for its VMAF calculations.
CUDA accelerated VMAF makes previously unfeasible projects possible for Snap. Snap is looking to expand its use of VMAF-CUDA to other applications and completely transition from CPU-based to GPU-based VMAF computations.
V-Nova
V-Nova is exploring the benefits of CUDA-accelerated VMAF calculation for several use cases. These include its usefulness in both offline metric calculation and real-time decision-making within the LCEVC (MPEG-5 Part 2) encoding process. The integration of VMAF-CUDA can significantly accelerate offline metric calculations.
V-Nova’s video quality tools, including Video Quality Framework and Parallel Performance Runner (PAPER), processed approximately 20K encoding jobs weekly in 2023. VMAF-CUDA has demonstrated the ability to speed up metric calculation by at least 2x.
Looking ahead to the medium and long term, the real-time, in-loop VMAF calculation facilitated by VMAF-CUDA could offer additional benefits for algorithmic enhancements, such as optimizing LCEVC mode decisions and rate control for this metric.

As an extensible framework and ecosystem for describing, composing, simulating, and collaborating within 3D worlds, OpenUSD enables developers to build interoperable 3D workflows, unlocking a new era of industrial digitalization.
Additionally, NVIDIA Omniverse will offer native support for the new OpenPBR material model, a MaterialX-based uber-shader model co-developed by Adobe and Autodesk. This integration gives users a unified material interface that can be used across various applications.
Standardizing material interchange
Created to define the strategy for material representation in OpenUSD, the first item of the AOUSD Materials Working Group is to standardize the MaterialX standard library with OpenUSD in UsdShade.
Any conforming OpenUSD implementation will have access to a common, standardized set of shader nodes for building materials that work across renderers, without requiring a dependency on a particular shading backend. Industries that need the long-term stability of a standard definition will benefit from this update. Developers can use OpenUSD materials and be confident that they will work in the ecosystem currently and in the future.
What are shaders and why are they important?
To describe materials in computer graphics, we use shaders, which are programs that a renderer runs to construct the material definition. The shader must tell the renderer how a material is structured, looking at the bidirectional scattering distribution functions (BSDFs) making up the layers of its surface appearance and how light is transported between them. It then describes how the BSDFs are modified across an object’s surface, usually by reading and combining textures to vary surface appearance.
There are many different languages for writing these programs and varying support for them in different renderers. For instance, many offline renderers enable writing shaders directly in C++ against their API, meaning they aren’t interoperable with other renderers.
In real-time applications, shaders are generally written in either GLSL or HLSL. GLSL and HLSL can do more than just describe materials, such as running compute workloads in Vulkan and DirectX. GLSL and HLSL are examples of low-level shading languages, where the implementation of a material’s constituent BSDFs must be written by the user directly in the language.
At the other end of the spectrum is NVIDIA Material Definition Language (MDL), a high-level shading language. MDL provides the BSDFs as closures and the user describes how to combine and vary them to produce the desired appearance.
MDL is responsible for taking that high-level definition and generating the low-level shading code to implement that material, in HLSL, PTX, C++, or some other language. A renderer then uses that generated code directly to evaluate the material’s appearance. The same material definition can be used across renderers on different hardware platforms while maintaining the same appearance.
Materials described in this fashion can be written as a single monolithic shader, but it is more common for users to author them using shader graphs. Shader graphs enable users to create new materials by plugging shader nodes in a graph editor. Shader nodes typically map to individual functions in the underlying shading language.
Materials can be described directly as shader graphs with OpenUSD using its UsdShade primitives as nodes. A node’s representation is unspecified. Users must provide an implementation for each shader to ensure that it works with the applications they plan on using to open the USD layer. OpenUSD enables the interchange of 3D scenes between different applications, and to achieve this, a common material description is necessary.
Describing materials as shader graphs with MaterialX
Hosted at the Academy Software Foundation (ASWF), MaterialX is an open-source, renderer-agnostic file format and library for describing materials as shader graphs. It defines a common set of nodes in its standard library. It also describes how the nodes are plugged together to form a graph. MaterialX can be represented either as an XML document with a custom schema (.mtlx format) or directly in OpenUSD as a graph of UsdShade nodes.
MaterialX uses pluggable backends to generate executable code, the most complete of which is MDL. When a renderer loads a MaterialX material through OpenUSD, it requests code generation from the backend. The backend then generates the low-level code for the target platform, which the renderer can execute to evaluate the material.
OpenUSD, MaterialX, and MDL create materials in a high-level description that can be shared across any supporting renderer on any target platform. This ensures that the visual appearance will be the same.
MaterialX is supported natively in Omniverse using the MDL backend and can be loaded directly as UsdShade graphs, or by referencing .mtlx documents into an OpenUSD layer.
MaterialX graphs can be arbitrarily large and complex, which in extreme cases can make them unsuitable for real-time use. NVIDIA Omniverse RTX Renderer uses MDL’s distilling technology to convert arbitrarily complex materials into a compact material representation that guarantees optimal real-time performance while preserving the material appearance.
OpenPBR: an uber-shader available in Omniverse and MaterialX
Material graphs offer users maximum flexibility for creating various materials, yet in intricate workflows, it’s often preferable to employ a single, overarching material definition known as an “uber-shader.” This shader can be used directly, for example with scanned PBR texture data. It can also serve as a foundation for further customization in a shader graph, saving users the trouble of building the entire material from scratch.
Last year, The Academy Software Foundation, Autodesk, and Adobe announced a new uber-shader model, OpenPBR being developed as an open specification and reference implementation within MaterialX. The NVIDIA Omniverse team is working with the OpenPBR group to finalize the new shading model and provide an OpenPBR implementation in Omniverse when the first production version of the shading model is released.
Omniverse will also have a new OpenPBR material library. Developers can use these materials, available as OpenUSD and MaterialX materials, in any OpenUSD stage. This library provides a ready-to-use, physically accurate library of materials to accelerate building visual applications.
Getting started with material interchange
Understanding the various technologies and their interconnections is crucial for developers and content creators working with materials in computer graphics. OpenUSD, together with MaterialX and MDL, provides a solution for seamless material interchange, enabling the sharing of materials between different applications and renderers.
With the support of Omniverse and the ongoing efforts of the AOUSD Materials Working Group, the promise of seamlessly interchangeable, complete, physically accurate material descriptions will become a reality.
In the future, the group will focus on adding complete physical material definitions in OpenUSD. This includes non-visual data like LiDAR, acoustic, and thermal properties. They’ll also explore new material descriptions like neural materials and work on exchanging OpenUSD materials with other systems like glTF.

Recent updates introduce a user-friendly developer interface and new capabilities for application deployment to the platform.
Holoscan for Media now includes Helm Dashboard, which delivers an intuitive user interface for orchestrating and managing Helm charts. Helm is the technology that helps developers define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications, simplifying and accelerating development and testing of application packaging and deployment.
With this update, Holoscan for Media also gets a new media-streaming reference application container. Media Gateway Next enables developers to run any GStreamer pipeline with ST 2110/NMOS integration and configure the senders and receivers needed to test an application under development.
The platform and developer documentation has also been expanded with instructions for a limited local setup on a single Linux host, and expanded cluster installation guide. Alongside the guides, an Ansible Playbook is now provided to install the OpenShift Container Platform on a new cluster.
Why NVIDIA Holoscan for Media?
NVIDIA Holoscan for Media revolutionizes application development for this rapidly evolving market by providing an IP-based, cloud-native architecture that isn’t constrained by dedicated hardware, environments, or locations. Instead, it integrates technologies that are ubiquitous and open source, enabling developers to simplify the development process, streamline delivery to customers, and integrate emerging technologies like generative AI into their solutions, all while optimizing costs.
Helm Dashboard for intuitive application management
Now, Helm Dashboard provides a GUI-driven way to manage Helm charts on a Holoscan for Media cluster. It provides an intuitive way to discover, install, update, and see revision histories and diffs for the Helm charts. Helm charts enable a user to configure values specific to the particular deployment through a values.yaml
file. Helm Dashboard makes it easy to edit and track revisions to the values in its user interface.
This container is principally based on the open-source Helm Dashboard project. A Helm chart is also provided for the Helm Dashboard itself. Once this is installed on the cluster, all other applications can be deployed through the simple Helm Dashboard user interface. Multiple instances of the same Helm chart can be installed on the cluster, each with a different configuration.
Helm Dashboard key capabilities include the following:
- Connect to multiple chart repositories, including NVIDIA NGC
- See all installed charts and their revision history
- See manifest diff of past revisions
- Browse Kubernetes resources resulting from the chart
- Roll back or upgrade to a new version easily
Media Gateway Next for NMOS registration and management
Media Gateway Next is a new reference container for Holoscan for Media, built on NVIDIA DeepStream. It adds a GStreamer element, nvdsnmosbin
, that enables the registration and management of NMOS senders and receivers corresponding to SMPTE ST 2110 sinks and sources in a flexible GStreamer pipeline passed to the container.
For a video walkthrough of the technology, see Bringing Up a NMOS-Capable ST 2110 Media Processing Node in 30 Minutes.
The pipeline description is configured through the Helm chart values.yaml
, and examples of pipelines for video and audio test sources and sinks are provided. Users can extend the examples with GStreamer elements by simply changing the pipeline description, for example, using Helm Dashboard.
In this way, video and audio test signals, file playback, and an SRT gateway, can all be deployed for testing without writing a single line of code.
Platform installation automation and developer guides
Holoscan for Media resources on NVIDIA NGC now include an Ansible Playbook to deploy a cluster from bare metal using Redfish and OpenShift Assisted Installer APIs. The Holoscan for Media Platform reference deployment guide now has more detailed steps for the subsequent Kubernetes performance tuning and operator configuration. Automation will be added soon.
Two new documents are provided for developers. See the building blocks of Holoscan for Media, recommended NVIDIA SDKs to build your application, and learn how to get started with your development, in the Developer Starting Guide. Get all the Holoscan for Media containerized applications running on a single Linux host with a ConnectX network adapter, by following the Local Developer Setup guide. The NMOS Registry, NMOS Controller, and multiple Media Gateway containers can all be run side by side.

Key Data Points
Today, a country that used to make up a small portion of Nvidia's revenue has become the company's biggest customer. What does this mean for Nvidia's stock? Let's find out.
The Statista chart below shows that U.S. companies, among the smallest Nvidia customers just four years ago, now make up the biggest share of the company's revenue. The U.S. accounted for more than $26 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year, while Taiwan and China delivered $13 billion and $10 billion, respectively. Sales to these countries have climbed from previous years' levels -- but not enough to surpass the enormous demand coming from the U.S.
Growth in the AI business
Nvidia said during its recent earnings report that this trend is thanks to compute and networking, referring to the broad range of products Nvidia offers to clients in the field of AI. So, this growth in the AI business has translated into more U.S.-based revenue. And this looks like good news for Nvidia, considering the U.S. ban on the export of high-performance chips to China. In the most recent quarter, the ban hurt Nvidia's sales to companies there.
Of course, Nvidia aims to rekindle sales growth in China by introducing chips not impacted by the ban, but it's still unclear whether these products will catch on.
So, what does this mean for investors? The growth in U.S. revenue, driven by AI demand, offers us visibility on future earnings prospects -- and the picture looks bright. That makes Nvidia a top AI stock to buy now.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/12/this-country-made-up-a-small-portion-of-nvda-sales/

Amid the company's dominance in artificial intelligence (AI)-ready chips and the insatiable demand for the technology, its stock has risen by close to 300% over the last 12 months.
With the stock approaching $1,000 per share, investors may wonder whether a stock split is imminent. Despite the fact that such a move will not directly influence Nvidia's valuation, investors should expect one soon. Here's why.
Nvidia and stock splits
The history of Nvidia stock is arguably the most compelling reason for expecting a near-term split. The company has split its stock five times since 2000, one of which has occurred since AI and data centers renewed investor interest in GPUs.
That previous split occurred on July 19, 2021, when Nvidia carried out a 4-for-1 stock split. Interestingly, it closed at a pre-split price of around $744 per share that day, a level lower than today's current price.
Still, investors should remember that these gains came quickly, as Nvidia stock is up about 85% this year and nearly 30% over the last month alone, indicating that a need for a split could have caught the company's board off guard.
NASDAQ: NVDA
Key Data Points
The big question surrounding the split
Moreover, the most significant question surrounding a split is likely where the company will set the split ratio. The most recent 4-for-1 split was the largest ratio in the company's history, with the company having approved three 2-for-1 splits and one 3-for-2 split in the 2000s.
However, as mentioned before, the more recent growth has probably exceeded expectations. While future growth may not match the 126% revenue increase in fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 31), analysts forecast 81% revenue growth in fiscal 2025 and 22% the next fiscal year, indicating the massive profit increases should continue for the foreseeable future.
That could possibly mean the stock price is not done rising. Conversely, slowing growth could soon dampen enthusiasm for the stock, and the company's board will have to consider the massive drops in the stock price in past years. Hence, the company has to be ready for any potential price movement when it decides the split ratio.
Another possible consideration
Investors may want also to consider another possible factor -- inclusion as one of the 30 stocks making up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
The S&P Dow Jones Indices, operated by S&P Global, has not telegraphed any intention to add Nvidia to the Dow 30. Also, the index already includes two semiconductor stocks, Apple and Intel.
However, Intel has struggled in recent years, increasing the chances of its removal. Also, AI's influence over the economy could lead to more tech stocks in the index, and Nvidia's $2.2 trillion market cap makes it a likely choice.
Furthermore, the Dow 30 is a price-weighted index. Since the nominal share price determines a stock's weighting on the Dow, companies have often initiated stock splits to reduce their influence over the index. Should Nvidia seek a place on the Dow 30, it may alter the split ratio to increase its chances of inclusion.
Making sense of a potential stock split
Given the company's history of stock splits, investors should expect such a move sooner rather than later. Also, since the previous split occurred less than three years ago at a lower price, the split ratio is likely the most significant question surrounding such a move.
Indeed, Nvidia's board will need to consider the stock's price history in deciding the ratio, both in a positive and negative sense. Also, assuming Nvidia seeks to become a Dow 30 stock, it will have to become more sensitive to its nominal share price.
Ultimately, the stock split changes nothing for Nvidia on the surface. However, given the company's history, shareholders should anticipate a split and, possibly, increased interest in the stock from some unexpected parties.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/12/nvidias-price-growing-headed-stock-split/

Except for Tesla, each Magnificent Seven stock has a market cap over $1 trillion.
However, I'd argue that Nvidia (NVDA +0.53%) is the most influential among megacap tech companies at the moment. Nvidia specializes in manufacturing semiconductor chips called graphics processing units (GPU).
Over the last year, demand for GPUs skyrocketed, given their role across a variety of generative AI applications including machine learning and accelerated computing. As such, shares of Nvidia have gone parabolic -- rocketing up to 284% in the last year.
In terms of dollars, consider that as of market close on March 7, Nvidia has added $1 trillion of market cap to its value since mid-January. The best part? I think the ride is just getting started.
Let's dig into how Nvidia gained access to the exclusive $2 trillion club, and why further gains could be on the horizon.
NASDAQ: NVDA
Key Data Points
Nvidia's path to $1 trillion is impressive, but...
Nvidia generates revenue from several sources including graphics processors, compute networking, and data center operations. During the company's fiscal 2024, ended Jan. 28, Nvidia's largest revenue stream was from its data center business -- which grew 217% year over year.
This is undoubtedly impressive, but what investors may not totally understand is that Nvidia's data center business has been steadily rising for quite some time. In fact, revenue from the broader compute and networking division (which includes data centers) has increased more than 1,000% in just four years.
This is an important data point because in a way it undermines that Nvidia has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence (AI) for a while. Given the company's first-mover advantage as it pertains to AI-powered chips and quantum computing, Nvidia has amassed significant pricing power over its peers.
Unsurprisingly, Nvidia's accelerating revenue led to significant margin expansion and is dropping to the bottom line. For the year ended Jan. 28, Nvidia grew its free cash flow by more than sixfold over the prior year to $27 billion.
Now, with an arsenal of capital and interest in AI rising, Nvidia looks well positioned to keep dominating. Here's a preview of what the company has been exploring beyond its GPU and data center businesses.
More gains could be ahead
With so much cash at its disposal, Nvidia has quietly been deploying capital into other areas that could unlock further sustained growth.
Back in September, Nvidia participated in a $500 million funding round in artificial intelligence (AI) start-up Databricks. At first glance, this may look like a bit of a head-scratcher. But during the fourth quarter earnings call, Nvidia investors learned about the company's latest billion-dollar business -- enterprise software.
While Nvidia has been hard at work investing in its core chip business, the company also quietly built a software platform that it hopes will complement the semiconductor operation. Indeed, software services have myriad applications in the realm of AI. And while the partnership with Databricks is exciting, Nvidia isn't stopping there.
Another unique area that Nvidia is investing is voice-recognition software. The company holds a small stake in a company called SoundHound AI.
I found this particularly interesting because many of Nvidia's big tech cohorts have been investing in this technology for years. Since Apple's acquisition of voice-assistant Siri, the technology has become integrated throughout the company's hardware ecosystem. Furthermore, both Amazon and Alphabet use voice-powered AI for their respective lines of smart-home appliances.
Meanwhile, Microsoft acquired smart assistant Nuance a few years ago for a whopping $20 billion. Given that the market for voice-powered software services is expected to reach $50 billion by the end of the decade, I can see why Nvidia followed its counterparts.
The last area that Nvidia is showing interest is humanoid robotics. For years, Tesla has garnered most of the attention surrounding this technology due to its Optimus bot. But recently, Nvidia joined Intel Capital, OpenAI, and Jeff Bezos in a funding round for Figure AI. Robotics is a particularly subtle area in which Nvidia could disrupt both the hardware and software applications.
Where is Nvidia headed next?
As a long-term investor, I am encouraged by Nvidia's aggressive pursuits beyond GPUs and data center operations. While the software business is still relatively small and these investments are still in nascent phases of their potential, Nvidia's AI roadmap looks enticing.
At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 74, Nvidia stock isn't cheap. However, the company's revenue and profits are soaring -- and I don't see that stopping anytime soon.
It took over two decades for Nvidia to reach a $1 trillion dollar market cap. It took less than a year to get to $2 trillion.
While I can't say definitely where Nvidia is headed next, I'm confident further gains are in store in the long run. Given the company's investments into various new markets, Nvidia is quickly differentiating its business from the competition.
In the long run, I see Nvidia becoming a full-spectrum AI platform connected by a unique combination of both hardware and software. Despite its premium valuation, I think now is a terrific time to scoop up some shares.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/12/nvidia-has-added-1-trillion-to-its-market-cap-in-5/

- It was at a Denny's restaurant that he and his cofounders came up with the idea for Nvidia.
Jensen Huang is the cofounder and CEO of Nvidia, the $2 trillion chip manufacturer powering the AI revolution.
In a recent interview with Stanford's Graduate School of Business, Huang reflected on his early career working minimum wage jobs to explain how he has developed the work ethic to succeed as a CEO.

Huang was referring to his first job at Denny's, which he jokingly called his ""alma mater.""
""I was probably Denny's best dish washer … I washed the living daylights out of the dishes,"" he said.
Huang later came up with the idea for Nvidia over a meal at a Denny's restaurant with his cofounders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem in 1993.
He presented the idea to his previous employer Wilfred Corrigan, then-CEO of LSI Logic, who called it ""one of the worst elevator pitches he's ever heard,"" Huang said.
But Corrigan still convinced the founder of Sequoia Capital, Don Valentine, to invest in Nvidia because of Huang's strong work ethic.
Huang said he has worked just as hard as a corporate employee as he did cleaning toilets in the past — and he made sure the audience knew that it was a lot of toilets. ""I have cleaned more toilets than all of you combined,"" he joked.
Talking onstage, donning his trademark leather jacket, Huang said execs should be approachable to their employees.
Instead of isolating themselves, he said that CEOs should have the most direct reports — he has 50 people he manages directly. He said he encourages employees of all levels to share their feedback and come to him for help.
Still, he has previously acknowledged that running a company is far from easy.
Starting Nvidia ""was a million times harder. than he expected, he said on an episode of the tech podcast ""Acquired"" last year. ""No one in their right mind would do it,"" he added.",https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-boss-jensen-huang-work-ethic-dennys-cleaning-toilets-dishwashing-2024-3

“I planned my work. I was organized. I was mise en place,” Huang said during a March 2024 interview with Stanford Graduate School of Business. “I washed the living daylights out of those dishes.”
Now he’s beating the living daylights out of the competition as president and CEO of Nvidia, the world’s premiere advanced chip manufacturer. He’s now worth $151 billion, and the company he cofounded has a $4.3 trillion market cap. Huang on Tuesday was also ranked No. 1 on Fortune‘s list of the 100 Most Powerful People in Business.
But Huang attributes his wild success in business to the work ethic he picked up during his time with Denny’s as a dishwasher, before he was “promoted” to busboy.
“I never left the station empty-handed. I never came back empty-handed. I was very efficient,” Huang said. “Anyways, eventually I became a CEO. I’m still working on being a good CEO.”
And his alma mater of sorts, Denny’s, has honored Huang the best way they know how: by adding a menu item in honor of his chipmaking behemoth.
Denny’s debuted the aptly named Nvidia Breakfast Bytes earlier this year to pay tribute to Huang’s “remarkable journey from Denny’s dishwasher and server to a tech titan.” The breakfast includes four sausage links that customers can wrap in Denny’s buttermilk silver dollar pancakes and dip in maple syrup—which is Huang’s favorite way to eat the dish, according to Denny’s.
“Jensen’s journey from Denny’s kitchen and dining room to the pinnacle of the tech world is a testament to the power of dreams and determination,” Denny’s CEO Kelli Valade said in a statement. “We’re deeply honored that America’s Diner played a role in NVIDIA’s origin story as a global AI powerhouse.
How Huang cofounded Nvidia
Huang was born in Taiwan in 1963, moved to Thailand at age 5, and moved to Washington State in the U.S. when he was 9. He went to high school outside of Portland, Ore., where he started working for Denny’s at age 15, according to an Nvidia blog post. Huang then earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University, then went on to get his master’s in the same subject from Stanford University in 1992.
Not only did Huang land his first job at Denny’s—but it’s also the place where he and two of his friends cooked up the idea that would make him a billionaire. In 1993, Huang, along with Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem (who both worked at Sun Microsystems), met at what was one of Denny’s “most popular” locations in Northern California to discuss “creating a chip that would enable realistic 3D graphics on personal computers,” according to the Nvidia blog post.
“Chris and Curtis said one day they’d like to leave [Sun Microsystems], and they’d like me to go figure out what they’re going to leave for,” Huang said. “They insisted I figure out with them how to build a company.” But with little runway on how to build a business, Huang said he resolved to visit a bookstore to find books on starting a business and found one titled How to Write a Business Plan by Gordon Bell. But the issue was the book was 450 pages long.
“Well, I never got through it. And not even close,” Huang said. “I flipped through a few pages and I go, ‘You know what, by the time I’m done reading this thing, I’ll be out of business.” So with that, Huang took to a Denny’s booth with his two friends to brainstorm a business.
At the time, Huang was working as an engineer with LSI Logic, a company in Santa Clara, Calif., that sold semiconductors and software. Avago Technologies acquired LSI Logic for $6.6 billion in 2014. But Huang kind of skips over that part when he’s telling his career story.
“My first job before CEO was a dishwasher,” Huang said in the Stanford interview. “And I did that very well.”
While at Denny’s that fateful night, Huang, Malachowsky, and Priem “polished off a Lumberjack Slam, Moons Over My Hammy, and a Super Bird sandwich—washed down with plenty of coffee,” according to Nvidia, the perfect fuel for masterminding a new technology. Now there’s a booth dedicated to Huang at an East San Jose Denny’s location.
“The PC revolution was just getting going,” Huang said in the Stanford interview. “We thought, why don’t we build a company that solves problems that a normal computer that is powered by general purpose computing can’t. That became the company’s mission.” Some of the industries “opened up,” Huang said, as a result of Nvidia’s technology, include computational drug design, weather simulation, materials design, robotics, self-driving cars—and the big one: artificial intelligence.
Nvidia’s technology “enabled a whole new way of developing software where the computer wrote the software itself—artificial intelligence as we know it today,” Huang said. “That was the journey.”
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership advice
While Nvidia has undoubtedly been developing the technology fueling the AI revolution, it had done so relatively quietly until just about a month ago. But in February 2024, its 46% stock surge pushed it past Amazon, adding about $560 billion in market value. Then Nvidia beat out Alphabet to become the third most valuable U.S. company. But there are some skeptics who think Nvidia may be overvalued. Apollo Global Management said that Nvidia’s inflated earnings are creating an AI bubble even “bigger than the 1990s tech bubble.”
But even as successful as Nvidia becomes, Huang consistently reflects on his humble beginnings. He tries to maintain a very flat structure at his company and lends a helping hand where he can. He says (counter to conventional business wisdom) that a CEO should have the most direct reports; he has 50.
“No task is beneath me,” he said. “I used to be a dishwasher. I used to clean toilets. I cleaned a lot of toilets. I’ve cleaned more toilets than all of you combined. And some of them you just can’t unsee.”

The apparel retailer soared on a 21% increase in 2023 sales of $1.45 billion—up from $1.2 billion the year before—but tepid sales growth predictions for 2024 have halted its skyrocketing stock. Following the earnings report, shares fell 9.7% in Abercrombie’s worst week since August 2022.
The retailer expects net sales growth from 4% to 6% for fiscal 2024, in line with estimates but lower than last year. Concerns over Abercrombie’s ability to sustain revenue growth have caused shares to sink, Bloomberg reported.
Morgan Stanley analyst Alex Straton said in a March 7 note that Abercrombie’s profitability expectations could be too optimistic. Fashion brands, which rely on cyclical seasons and trends, are vulnerable to missteps, should they miss the mark on product rollout.
“The risk-reward skews to the downside from current levels… We caution current growth and profitability levels could be difficult to maintain heading into [the second half of the year],” she said.
Abercrombie reached high highs in 2023, with its performance landing it at the top of the S&P 1500 Index. In 2023, it gained 285%, higher than AI darling Nvidia’s 239% surge, and has gained closer to 400% over the past 12 months. The retailer owes its sales success to revamping its inventory to appeal to younger shoppers, as well as customers who don’t mind inflation-induced higher prices.
Horowitz said the company intends to continue to lean on its expanding audience of both older Gen Zers and young millennials for future growth.
“The addressable market has gone from customers in their early twenties to late thirties, and we’ve broadened all the offerings from a category perspective,” Horowitz said. Abercrombie has launched both special occasion, casual, and activewear lines to dress young people for their weekend endeavors.
Young generations have a strong interest in clothing with 87% of Gen Z, as well as 82% of millennials, planning to buy fashion items over the next six months, according to a February UNiDays survey of over 5,000 UK students. While Gen Z is cost-conscious and thrifty, they also don’t mind splurging a little extra on luxury goods. Gen Z and millennials are the generations most likely to make splurge purchases, including pricier fashion items. A June 2023 Harris Poll of over 2000 U.S. adults found that 75% of Gen Z and 68% of millennials made splurge purchases last year.
But even young fashion enthusiasts may not be able to reverse the trends of uncertainty in the fashion industry. McKinsey & Company’s State of Fashion 2024 report predicts a 2% to 4% “slower but normalized” growth in the industry as a result of inflation and lack of consumer confidence. The Bureau of Labor Statistics noted a 0.6% uptick this month in CPI for urban consumers in apparel.
The fashion industry may have an uncertain future, but Abercrombie has built back from hardships in the past. A decade ago, the company was struggling to remain relevant and liked.
How Abercrombie reclaimed the hearts—and wallets—of millennials
Only eight years before being the highest-performing stock, Abercrombie earned the 2016 superlative of most hated retailer. Previously the company leaned on the appeal of low-rise jeans and hypersexualized models, but its image soured after a slate of controversies, including a class-action racial discrimination lawsuit and comments by former CEO Mike Jeffries calling the retailer “exclusionary” in a 2006 interview.
Horowitz, who became Abercrombie’s CEO in 2017, actively worked to change the company’s cliquey reputation perpetuated by her predecessor.
“We are a positive, inclusive brand, with a nice sensibility, very different from what they encountered in the past,” Horowitz said in 2016.
By 2019, Abercrombie had completely overhauled its inventory and expanded its sizes. Stores ditched the loud music and thick clouds of perfume. In a bid to separate itself from sister brand Hollister, it moved away from dressing teens in favor of pursuing young graduates and adults entering the workforce.
The strategy worked. In November 2022, the company posted an expectation-exceeding profit, even in the aftershocks of the pandemic and high inflation. Over the past five years, it has more than tripled its market capitalization, which grew from $1.83 billion in March 2019 to nearly $6 billion.
“We grew up Abercrombie,” Horowitz said in a 2022 Fortune interview. “We really focused on this young millennial, this young, mid-twenties consumer, and we got the response that we were hoping for.”",https://fortune.com/2024/03/12/abercrombie-stock-nvidia-earnings-gen-z-millennials/

Key Data Points
A future of AI factories
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has outlined his vision for the future in which companies no longer just have regular data centers for storing data and running computing tasks. Rather, he sees all companies deploying ""AI factories"" both in the cloud and on premises, as generative AI becomes embedded in a wide range of applications and becomes a core aspect in every part of business.
Not only that, but he sees the AI chip market not merely replacing the current CPU-based computing architecture but expanding on it. This is because not only will generative AI require Nvidia GPUs -- Huang also sees traditional computing needing acceleration via GPUs as well:
You can tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from four to six years. There's just no reason to update with more CPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to. And so you have to accelerate everything.
Nvidia lent some credence to that assertion by telling investors that about 40% of its data center revenue went to inference last year. Inferencing is when a trained model reacts to a prompt -- in other words, when generative AI models are used in the real world. Some had thought that while training needed high-powered GPUs, inferencing could be done by lower-power CPUs from competitors. However, Nvidia's inference disclosure shows its GPUs aren't just needed for training, but may even be the most efficient inferencing choice as well.
And not only will enterprises be building out AI factories, but countries and regions will be as well. Huang calls this ""sovereign AI."" This comes as governments around the world work with their own sovereign data in their own language reflecting their own culture as AI becomes more human-like and embedded in society.
Add it all up, and numbers get big
What does this all add up to for Nvidia's financials? Key industry participants have put forward their cases for the AI market outlook. For his part, Jensen Huang estimates the roughly $1 trillion worth of data centers across the world will all be replaced by accelerated computers, and that the AI transition plus the broadening of customers (i.e. sovereign AI) will push that total market to $2 trillion.
If one anticipates a five-year lifespan for accelerated computing servers, that equates to about $400 billion per year in AI data center revenue.
This falls somewhat in line with rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD +1.34%) CEO Lisa Su's outlook. Back in December, she said she anticipates the AI accelerator market to reach $400 billion by 2027, up from her previous outlook for just $150 billion. And while that includes more edge devices, including AI PC chips, Nvidia also makes GPU chips for PCs too with its RTX line. But data center chips will likely make up the vast majority of that $400 billion.
Obviously, Nvidia totally dominates the AI accelerator market right now, with a first mover advantage in terms of both technology innovation as well as its CUDA software ecosystem. Estimates for its current market share of AI chips run between 80% and 95% of the current market. Of course, rival AMD just unveiled its MI300 accelerators last quarter, its first AI accelerator, and other cloud giants and start-ups alike will no doubt be gunning for a part of this exciting market.
Still, I'd lean toward Nvidia hanging onto a large portion of the market. Maybe not 95%, but certainly a majority. And a lot of it has to do with its software.
A $1 billion run rate just the start?
While Nvidia is known for its chips, its software chops could be what sets it apart and bolsters its economic moat. While Nvidia invented the CUDA software library almost 20 years ago in order to program its graphics chips for data processing, it's also recently come out with other compelling software offerings. These include Nvidia Omniverse for digital twin modeling of physical objects, and Nvidia DRIVE for autonomous driving.
But the most consequential software feature is likely something called Nvidia AI Enterprise. Discussed on the last earnings call, Nvidia AI Enterprise is essentially a new operating system that allows cloud software to run on accelerated GPU chips.
Huang explained that in the cloud era, the largest enterprise software companies had large engineering teams that deployed complex software on traditional CPU-based cloud infrastructure, or they were able to get help via the large cloud service providers (CSPs). But many top software companies don't have the engineers to do so for accelerated GPUs, nor do the cloud CSPs for the most part.
Huang explained Nvidia AI Enterprise as a containerized operating system which will help software companies run their AI-infused applications on Nvidia chips in a seamless fashion. Nvidia charges $4,500 per GPU per year for the service, and it's already at a $1 billion run-rate. One can imagine if every software company embeds generative AI within their offerings, as one should probably expect, this new software could become a big business.
Outlook 2028
If the AI chip market achieves the $400 billion level and Nvidia retains, say, 60% to 80% of the market, that equates to somewhere between $240 billion and $320 billion in revenues. Those levels are multiples higher than last year's $60 billion in total revenue, even though last year's revenues surged a staggering 126%.
But course, Nvidia has also impressed in expanding its product set over time, especially into software, which tends to carry high margins and garner higher multiples in the market. And of course, Nvidia still has incremental revenue and profits from its gaming, visualization, and auto chip segments, too.
A big question is Nvidia's achievable margins. While some expect net income margins to come down from the ridiculous 58% posted last quarter, I'm not so sure the company won't be able to maintain something close to those figures, given Nvidia's massive global scale and pricing power.
At, say, even a 50% net margin, it wouldn't be a surprise to see Nvidia making $150 billion in net earnings five years out, as ridiculous as those numbers may seem today. And today's $2.18 trillion market cap amounts to just 14.6 times those theoretical future profits.
That's actually quite a reasonable valuation should Nvidia continue to dominate the AI market, and if that market evolves as major AI CEOs have projected.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/11/where-will-nvidia-be-in-5-years/

Update: Supermicro and EBox section updated 13 March 2024.
The BlueField-3 is a networking platform with integrated software-defined hardware accelerators for networking, storage, and security. Nvidia’s BlueField-3 portfolio includes DPUs and SuperNICs, providing RDMA over ROCE, with both operating at up to 400Gbps and a PCIe gen 5 interface. VAST Data supplies a disaggregated single QLC flash tier, parallel, scale-out, file-based storage system and has built up layers of software sitting on top of this: data catalog, global namespace, database, and coming data engine, all with an AI focus.
Jeff Denworth, co-founder at VAST Data, talked about the news in AI factory architecture terms, saying in a statement: “This new architecture is the perfect showcase to express the parallelism of the VAST Data Platform. With NVIDIA BlueField-3 DPUs, we can now realize the full potential of our vision for disaggregated data centers that we’ve been working toward since the company was founded.”
The existing VAST storage controller nodes (C-nodes) are x86 servers. The controller software has been ported to the 16 Armv8.2+ A78 Hercules cores on the BlueField-3 card, and this new VAST architecture is being tested and deployed first at CoreWeave, the GPU-as-a-service cloud farm supplier.
VAST highlights four aspects of its BlueField-3 (BF3) controller adoption:
- Fewer independent compute and networking resources, reducing the power usage and data center footprint for VAST infrastructure by 70 percent and a net energy consumption saving of over 5 percent compared to deploying NVIDIA-powered supercomputers (GPU servers) with the previous VAST distributed data services infrastructure.
- Eliminating contention for data services infrastructure by giving each GPU server a dedicated and parallel storage and database container. Each BlueField-3 can read and write into the shared namespaces of the VAST Data system without coordinating IO across containers.
- Enhanced security as data and data management remain protected and isolated from host operating systems.
- Providing block storage services natively to host operating systems – combining with VAST’s file, object, and database services.
This fourth point is a BlueField-3 SNAP feature, providing elastic block storage via NVMe and VirtIO-blk. Neeloy Bhattacharyya, Director, AI/HPC Solutions Engineering at VAST Data, told us this is not a VAST-only feature: ” It is on any GPU server with BF3 in it, with no OS limitation or limitation of the platform that the BF3 is connected to. The block device is presented from the BF3, so it can be used to make the GPU server stateless.”
We asked is VAST now delivering block storage services generally to host systems? Bhattacharyya replied: ”Not yet, that will be available later this year.”
VAST has Ceres storage nodes (D-nodes) with BF1 and we asked if the block protocol will include them: “Yes, the block device is presented on the BF3, so the hardware the CNode function is talking to on the backend does not matter.”
We also asked if this is effectively an update on the original Ceres-BlueField 1 announcement in March 2022. He said: “No, this announcement is the logic function (aka CNode) running on a BF3 hosted in a GPU-based server. This means VAST now has an end-to-end BlueField solution (between the BF3 in the GPU server and currently BF1 in the DBox). By hosting the CNode on the BF3, each GPU server has dedicated resources to access storage which provides security, removes contention between GPU servers and simplifies scaling.”
Back in May last year we interpreted VAST’s Thinking Machine’s vision in a diagram (see above), and Bhattacharyya told us us: “this is the realization of that vision.”
Peter Salanki, VP of Engineering at CoreWeave, said: “VAST’s revolutionary architecture is a game-changer for CoreWeave, enabling us to fully disaggregate our data centers. We’re seamlessly integrating VAST’s advanced software directly into our GPU clusters.”
The performance angle is interesting. As no x86 servers are involved in the data path on the VAST side there is no need for the x86 server host CPU-bypassing GPUDirect. Denworth told B&F: “Performance-wise, the introduction of VAST’s SW on BlueField processors does not change our DBox numbers, these are orthogonal. We currently get 6.5 GBps of bandwidth from a BlueField-3 running in a host. The aggregate is what matters… some hosts have one BF-3, others have 2 for this purpose – which results in up to 13 GBps per host. Large clusters have 1,000 of machines with GPUs in them. So, we’re essentially talking about being able to deliver up to 13 TBps per every 1,000 clients.”
Supermicro and EBox
VAST Data is also partnering Supermicro to deliver a full-stack, hyperscale, end-to-end AI system, certified by Nvidia, for service providers, hyperscale tech companies and large, data-centric enterprises. Customers can now buy a fully-optimized VAST Data Platform AI system stack built on industry-standard servers directly from Supermicro or select distribution channels.
There is a second VAST-Supermicro offering which is an alternative to the BlueField-3 configuration and aimed at exabyte scale deployments. A LinkedIn post by VAST staffer John Mao, VP Global Business Development, said the company has developed an ” ‘EBox’, whereby a single standard (non-HA) server node is qualified to run both VAST “CNode” software containers and VAST “DNode” containers as microservices installed on the same machine.”
“While from a physical appearance this offering may look like many other software-defined storage solutions in the market, it’s critically important to understand that the DASE software architecture remains 100 percent intact, to preserve true cluster wide data and performance parallelism (ie. no distributed lock or cache management required, every CNode container still mounts every SSD to appear as local disks, and CNode containers never communicate with each other in the read/write data path.)”
The term EBox refers to an exabyte-scale system. Mao says that, at this scale, “failure domains shift from server-level to rack-level, homogeneity of systems become critical in order to optimize their hardware supply chain, and better overall utilization of data center rack space and power.”
Write speed increase
Denworth has written a blog, “We’ve Got The Write Stuff… Baby”, about VAST increasing its system’s write speed as the increasing scale of AI training processing means a greater need for checkpointing at intervals during a job. The idea is it would safeguard against re-running the whole job if an infrastructure component fails. We saw a copy of the blog before it went live, and Denworth says: “Large AI supercomputers are starting to shift the balance of read/write I/O and we at VAST want to evolve with these evolutions. Today, we’re announcing two new software advancements that will serve to make every VAST cluster even faster for write-intensive operations.”
They are SCM RAID and Spillover. Regarding Storage-Class Memory (SCM) RAID, Denworth writes: “To date, all writes into a VAST system have been mirrored into storage class memory devices (SCM). Mirroring data is not as performance-efficient as using erasure codes. … Starting in 5.1 (available in April, 2024), we’re proud to announce that the write path will now be accelerated by RAIDing data as it flows into the system’s write buffer. This simple software update will introduce a performance increase of 50 performance.”
Currently write buffers in a VAST system are the SCM drives with their fixed capacity, which can be less than the capacity needed for a checkpointed AI job. So: “Later this summer (2024), version 5.2 of VAST OS will support a new mode where large checkpoint writes will spillover to also write directly into QLC flash. This method intelligently detects when the system is frequently being written to and allows large, transient writes to spillover into QLC flash.”
All-in-all these two changes will help reduce the VAST hardware needed for AI training: “When considering how we configure these systems for large AI computers, write-intensive configurations will see a 62 percent reduction in required hardware within 6 months time. … If we take our performance sizing for NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD as a benchmark, our write flow optimizations dramatically reduce the amount of hardware needed for a single Scalable Unit (SU).”

At the moment, no trend is captivating the attention and pocketbooks of investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).
When discussing ""AI,"" I'm talking about the use of software and systems to handle tasks that humans would normally manage. However, the true value of AI is seen with the incorporation of machine learning, which allows AI software and systems to evolve over time so they can become more efficient at their tasks.
Last year, researchers at PwC released a report (""PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution"") that suggested AI would add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. This would include a $6.6 trillion increase in productivity, as well as $9.1 trillion derived from consumption-side effects.
The sector- and industrywide appeal of AI isn't lost on Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers. Billionaire investors from many of the most-watched investment funds have been strategically moving their capital into and out of certain artificial intelligence stocks.
What's particularly noteworthy is that billionaires have been active sellers of the face of the AI movement -- semiconductor stock Nvidia (NVDA +0.63%) -- while piling into two other AI stocks.
Billionaire money managers are kicking Nvidia to the curb
Following the end of every quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These 13Fs provide investors with detailed snapshots of what the top asset managers have been buying and selling. Based on the latest round of 13F filings, eight prominent billionaires put Nvidia on the chopping block, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):
- Israel Englander of Millenium Management (1,689,322 shares)
- Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares)
- Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares)
- David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares)
- Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares)
- Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares)
- David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)
NASDAQ: NVDA
Key Data Points
Nvidia has become what I regularly refer to as the ""infrastructure backbone"" of the AI movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are a staple of high-compute data centers. Demand has, thus far, handily outpaced supply of Nvidia's chips, leading to off-the-scale pricing power that's sent the company's data center sales through the roof.
But there's also no shortage of reasons to believe that the best for Nvidia has come and gone. In addition to growing external competition from the likes of Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia could contend with a significant amount of internal competition for AI chips from its own top customers. Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon (AMZN +1.19%), and Alphabet, collectively account for around 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet all four companies are developing high-powered AI chips of their own.
Billionaires might also be turned off by the regulatory headwinds Nvidia is dealing with. An initial round of export restrictions to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product, prompted Nvidia to develop the toned-down A800 and H800 chips. However, U.S. regulators ultimately restricted the export of these chips to China, as well. China is a key market for Nvidia, and these restrictions threaten to reduce its sales by billions of dollars every quarter.
The valuation doesn't make much sense, either. Nvidia is nearing the same levels that Amazon and Cisco Systems peaked at during the dot-com bubble, based on trailing-12-month sales. We've simply never seen a market-leading business trade at such a premium to its sales for an extended period of time. It shouldn't be that surprising that billionaires have been selling Nvidia stock.
Artificial intelligence stock No. 1 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Baidu
The first AI stock that had billionaire money managers completely forgetting about Nvidia during the December-ended quarter is China-based Baidu (BIDU +0.16%). Though not all billionaire investors will put their funds' money to work in China stocks, eight billionaires were buyers of Baidu (say that three times fast) during the fourth quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):
- Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (290,154 shares)
- Israel Englander of Millennium Management (147,481 shares)
- Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (135,600 shares)
- Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (80,815 shares)
- Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (47,000 shares)
- David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (38,966 shares)
- Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (5,545 shares)
NASDAQ: BIDU
Key Data Points
Baidu's utilization of AI can be seen in two of its fastest-growing segments: cloud and intelligent driving. The company's AI Cloud can allow merchants to use generative AI solutions to tailor ads to individual customers. Meanwhile, Apollo Go is the world's most-successful autonomous ride-hailing service, with accumulated rides on public roads surpassing 5 million since inception. AI-fueled ventures are helping Baidu's non-online marketing segment grow by a double-digit percentage more often than not.
What billionaire investors might appreciate with Baidu, in relation to Nvidia, is that its foundational operating segment would likely prevent it from tumbling if the AI bubble bursts. Baidu's internet search segment has accounted for between 60% and 85% of China-based internet search share over the past nine years. Having the clearly dominant search engine in China should afford Baidu strong ad-pricing power in most economic climates.
Billionaires are likely also attracted to Baidu's minuscule valuation. Even factoring in the regulatory risks of investing in China-based companies, Baidu is valued at just 8 times forward-year earnings and less than 2 times trailing-12-month sales. It's a far cry from the mammoth valuation Wall Street has assigned to Nvidia, and presumably places a safe floor beneath Baidu's stock.
Artificial intelligence stock No. 2 billionaire investors are buying instead of Nvidia: Amazon
The other AI stock that had billionaires forgetting about Nvidia is none other than ""Magnificent Seven"" component Amazon. During the December-ended quarter, eight successful billionaire investors piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):
- Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares)
- Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares)
- Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares)
- Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares)
- David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares)
- Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares)
- Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)
NASDAQ: AMZN
Key Data Points
Amazon is incorporating AI solutions into its operations in more ways than can be counted here. Some of the more intriguing applications include leaning on generative AI solutions within its cloud infrastructure services platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) to help merchants personalize advertising to consumers, as well as relying on generative AI to improve the quality of product listings for merchants.
Although most people are familiar with Amazon because of its market-leading e-commerce platform, online retail sales contribute very little in the way of operating cash flow or profits since it's a low-margin segment. The lion's share of the cash flow Amazon generates can be traced back to its ancillary operations: AWS, subscription services, and advertising services.
AWS is the critical cog that's powering Amazon's cash flow higher. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages of growth, which suggests AWS can sustain its leading share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Despite only accounting for a sixth of Amazon's net sales, AWS was responsible for two-thirds of Amazon's operating income last year.
Amazon is also historically cheap, when compared to Nvidia. Shares are currently valued at less than 13 times consensus cash flow per share for 2025, which represents a 44% discount to Amazon's average multiple to cash flow over the prior five-year period.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/12/forget-nvidia-billionaires-sell-buying-2-ai-stocks/

Next-Generation NVIDIA DGX Systems Could Launch Soon with Liquid Cooling
During the 2024 SIEPR Economic Summit, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged that the company's next-generation DGX systems, designed for AI and high-performance computing workloads, will require liquid cooling due to their immense power consumption. Huang also hinted that these new systems are set to be released in the near future. The revelation comes as no surprise, given the increasing power of GPUs needed to satisfy AI and machine learning applications. As computational requirements continue to grow, so does the need for more powerful hardware. However, with great power comes great heat generation, necessitating advanced cooling solutions to maintain optimal performance and system stability. Liquid cooling has long been a staple in high-end computing systems, offering superior thermal management compared to traditional air cooling methods.
By implementing liquid cooling in the upcoming DGX systems, NVIDIA aims to push the boundaries of performance while ensuring the hardware remains reliable and efficient. Although Huang did not provide a specific release date for the new DGX systems, his statement suggests that they are on the horizon. Whether the next generation of DGX systems uses the current NVIDIA H200 or the upcoming Blackwell B100 GPU as their primary accelerator, the performance will undoubtedly be delivered. As the AI and high-performance computing landscape continues to evolve, NVIDIA's position continues to strengthen, and liquid-cooled systems will certainly play a crucial role in shaping the future of these industries.

More specifically, Nvidia's market cap of $2.22 trillion means it is now the third-biggest company globally, ranking just behind Apple (AAPL +0.41%), which has a market cap of $2.61 trillion.
It is worth noting that these tech giants have experienced divergent fortunes on the stock market in 2024. While shares of Nvidia shot up 79% this year already, Apple stock has moved in the opposite direction, dipping 12% as of this writing. As a result, Nvidia is now within touching distance of Apple's market cap.
But can Nvidia stock continue soaring and overtake Apple's market cap by next year? Let's find out.
Nvidia is set to grow at a much faster pace than Apple
A key reason Nvidia's market cap has grown while Apple's has declined is the different trajectories of the two companies. Nvidia is making the most of the artificial intelligence (AI) chip market, which is growing at a terrific pace. According to third-party estimates, the AI chip market is estimated to clock an annual growth rate of 38% through the end of the decade and generate $207 billion in annual revenue.
Nvidia's fiscal 2024 revenue increased 126% to $60.9 billion thanks to the lucrative AI data center graphics processing unit (GPU) market, where it dominates with an estimated market share of 98%, according to Wells Fargo. Nvidia is also enjoying terrific margins in AI GPUs as its chips are being sold for tens of thousands of dollars. This is reflected in the company's bottom-line performance, with its fiscal 2024 earnings jumping 288% to $12.96 per share.
NASDAQ: NVDA
Key Data Points
On the other hand, the smartphone market is Apple's bread and butter. The iPhone produced 58% of its total revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended Dec. 31, 2023). However, Apple's top line increased just 2% year over year to $119.6 billion during the quarter, while earnings were up 16% to $2.18 per share. Its iPhone revenue increased 6% year over year during the quarter, while sales of iPads and wearables fell. Also, sales of Apple's MacBooks remained flat last quarter.
A closer look at the end markets Apple serves tells us why it is growing more slowly than Nvidia. The smartphone market, for instance, is expected to grow by only 2.8% in 2024, as per IDC. The researcher estimates that smartphone sales will likely increase in the low single digits over the next five years. Tablet sales, meanwhile, are declining, while the personal computer (PC) market is forecast to turn around this year following steep declines in the past couple of years.
Additionally, Apple doesn't enjoy Nvidia-like dominance in the markets it serves. Though Apple was the top seller of smartphones in 2023, its market share stood at 20.1%. Last year, Samsung was the second-biggest smartphone company, with a 19.4% market share. Apple was the fourth-largest company in PCs last year by shipments, controlling just 8.5% of this market.
So, the bottom line is Nvidia is in pole position to capitalize on a fast-growing opportunity in the form of AI chips. Apple, however, is operating in mature markets where there are multiple contenders. As a result, it is unsurprising to see why Nvidia's revenue and earnings are forecast to increase much faster pace than Apple's.

Also, Apple's earnings are expected to grow at a much slower annual rate of 11% over the next five years compared to the 36% annual earnings growth Nvidia is expected to deliver during the same period. As such, seeing the market reward Nvidia with more gains won't be surprising. Apple stock, on the other hand, could remain in the doghouse thanks to the slow-growing nature of the smartphone market and recent developments suggesting the company may be late to the AI game.
iPhone sales in China reportedly fell an alarming 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint Research. Huawei gained at Apple's expense and recorded a 64% spike in sales during the same period. Meanwhile, Apple's biggest smartphone competitor, Samsung, has already jumped onto the AI smartphone bandwagon with its latest Galaxy series of smartphones. The good news for Samsung is that it expects to sell more flagship phones than its original forecast, and AI seems to be playing a key role in driving this performance.
This gives Samsung an advantage over Apple, which is yet to launch an AI-focused smartphone.
Which one will be the bigger company next year?
Apple has already lost the title of the world's largest company by market cap to Microsoft. And now, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia displace Apple and climb up the rankings.
As shown in the table above, Nvidia's revenue is expected to jump to almost $131 billion in fiscal 2026 (which will coincide with the majority of calendar 2025). Nvidia is trading at 35 times sales right now. While that's expensive, Nvidia has been able to justify its expensive valuation with outstanding growth in recent quarters.
The solid opportunity in AI chips means the market could also reward Nvidia with a rich sales multiple in the future. Assuming Nvidia maintains a discounted sales multiple of 25 next year and generates $131 billion in revenue, its market cap could increase to $3.27 trillion.
Apple, for comparison, trades at 7 times sales, slightly higher than its five-year average sales multiple of 6. Giving Apple a higher sales multiple doesn't make sense, considering its slower growth. Assuming it generates $413 billion in revenue next year and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could go to $2.9 billion, indicating Nvidia seems set to become a bigger company than Apple by 2025.

While there have been patches of strength throughout the broader market, it's the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks that have done the bulk of the heavy lifting.
The Magnificent Seven represent some of the largest and most-influential businesses in the country. Listed in descending order of market cap (as of the closing bell on March 5, 2024), the Magnificent Seven are comprised of:
- Microsoft (MSFT +1.61%)
- Apple (AAPL +0.41%)
- Nvidia (NVDA +0.63%)
- Amazon (AMZN +1.19%)
- Alphabet (GOOGL +0.50%)(GOOG +0.55%)
- Meta Platforms (META +5.56%)
- Tesla (TSLA +4.11%)
The Magnificent Seven are industry-leading businesses with impressive moats
What makes the Magnificent Seven so special is their sustained competitive advantages.
- Microsoft's Azure is the world's rapidly growing No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services, while Windows remains the global leader among desktop operating systems.
- Apple has been a pioneer in smartphone innovation for more than a decade, and offers a share repurchase program that no other publicly traded company can match.
- Nvidia is the infrastructure foundation of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate in AI-accelerated data centers.
- Amazon's e-commerce marketplace accounted for nearly 38% of U.S. online retail sales in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the global No. 1 cloud infrastructure service platform.
- Alphabet's Google had a monopoly like 92% share of worldwide internet search in February. Alphabet also owns the world's second most-visited social site (YouTube), as well as the third-largest cloud infrastructure service (Google) behind AWS and Azure.
- Meta Platforms is the company behind Facebook, the most-visited social site globally. Including other popular social-media destinations (WhatsApp, Instagram, and Threads), Meta attracts nearly 4 billion monthly active users.
- Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company that's currently profitable on a recurring basis. Tesla produced close to 1.85 million EVs last year.
Many of the Magnificent Seven stocks are also known for conducting stock splits -- Meta is the only Magnificent Seven component to have never split its shares.
NASDAQ: NVDA
Key Data Points
Forget Nvidia: Two other Magnificent Seven stocks are likeliest to split first
A ""stock split"" is a purely cosmetic event that allows a public company to alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact to its market cap or operating performance. The Magnificent Seven are known for conducting forward-stock splits, which are designed to make shares more affordable for retail investors who may not have access to fractional-share purchases with their broker.
Since the midpoint of 2021, quite a few of the Magnificent Seven have completed a forward-stock split, including:
- Nvidia: 4-for-1 stock split.
- Amazon: 20-for-1 stock split.
- Alphabet: 20-for-1 stock split.
- Tesla: 3-for-1 stock split.
Given that a single Nvidia share is setting investors back by almost $860, as of the closing bell on March 5, you'd probably think it's a slam-dunk to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock. However, Nvidia is set to face an ever-growing mountain of headwinds this year, and there's a real possibility the company's stock is an epic bubble. In other words, a split may not be in the cards anytime soon.
For example, even though Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs are dominating in high-compute data centers for the moment, competition is picking up in a big way. Advanced Micro Devices has begun its ramped rollout of the MI300X AI-GPU, while Intel anticipates launching its Gaudi3 AI chip later this year.
What's far more concerning is that four Magnificent Seven members -- Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet -- account for about 40% of Nvidia's sales, yet they're all developing their own high-powered AI chips. It's plainly evident that Nvidia's top customers are looking to lessen their reliance on GPUs from the current kingpin of AI.
Add in regulatory export concerns to China, a lack of insider buying, and the possibility of cannibalizing its own margins as its ramps A100 and H100 production, and there's potential for significant downside in Nvidia stock.
Instead of Nvidia becoming Wall Street's next stock-split stock, two other Magnificent Seven components appear poised to beat it to the punch.
Meta Platforms
The first Magnificent Seven member I'd expect to split its stock before Nvidia is social media titan Meta Platforms. Shares of the company topped $500 for the first time ever on March 1.
Although Meta has artificial intelligence tie-ins -- e.g., it's using generative AI solutions to help advertisers tailor their messages to individual users -- it wouldn't be susceptible to a bubble-bursting event if demand for AI infrastructure didn't meet investors' lofty expectations. This makes it more likely that Meta can sustain, if not build on, its nearly $500 share price.
The company's social media ""real estate"" is what makes it tick. Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded social apps worldwide. Businesses are aware that no social media company offers a greater reach than what Meta can bring to the table. As a result, Meta's ad-pricing power is exceptional in most economic climates.
As I've pointed out previously, Meta is sitting on an ever-growing treasure chest of cash. It closed out last year with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated more than $71 billion in net cash from its operating activities in 2023.
NASDAQ: META
Key Data Points
What all this cash does is allow CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take chances. Despite hefty operating losses from Meta's Reality Labs segment, Zuckerberg is attempting to position Meta to be an on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of this decade. Few other companies have the luxury of taking chances the way Meta can.
And unlike Nvidia, Meta remains historically inexpensive, even after its significant run-up from its 2022 bear market lows. Shares can be purchased right now for 13 times estimated cash flow in 2025, which represents a substantial discount to Meta's multiple to its cash flow over the trailing decade.
Microsoft
The other Magnificent Seven constituent that appears poised to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock before Nvidia is none other than tech giant Microsoft. Microsoft has split its shares nine times since going public, but last did so in February 2003. A single share of Microsoft is currently tipping the scales at north of $400.
Microsoft didn't reach a $3 trillion valuation and become the largest publicly traded by accident. It's achieved this distinction by seamlessly blending its legacy cash-cow segments with its fast-paced growth initiatives.
NASDAQ: MSFT
Key Data Points
As I pointed out earlier, Microsoft's legacy operations are still exceptionally profitable. Even though Windows has lost desktop operating system (OS) share over the past decade, it remains the undisputed OS leader in personal computing. The cash flow Microsoft generates from the likes of Windows and Office allows it to reinvest in high-growth initiatives and/or make acquisitions.
In terms of ""high-growth initiatives,"" cloud services and AI take the cake. On a currency-neutral basis, sales for Azure catapulted 28% higher during the fiscal second quarter, ended December 31. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its relative early innings, which suggests Azure can continue to capture global cloud infrastructure service spend share, as well as sustain a double-digit growth rate with ease.
Microsoft's AI ambitions are also on display. It's invested billions into OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, incorporated AI solutions into search engine Bing, and plans to lean on various generative AI solutions to assist businesses with document processing and conversational AI on the Azure platform.
Lastly, Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies that sports the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. Even if the AI bubble were to burst, Microsoft's legacy operations and cloud services wouldn't miss a beat.",https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/03/11/forget-nvidia-magnificent-seven-stock-split-stocks/

Databricks, the parent company of MosaicML, was also hit by a parallel lawsuit, with both filed in San Francisco federal court.
Both lawsuits claim the respective companies used a library of pirated ebooks called Books3 to train their large language models (LLMs).
Similar lawsuits have been filed against AI companies including OpenAI, its main investor Microsoft, Meta and others by authors and by The New York Times for training their AI systems on copyrighted content, which they argue violates copyright law.
Pirated books
Books3 is a dataset of about 196,640 books, mostly by contemporary authors such as Stephen King and John Grisham.
The three authors, Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene, and Stewart O’Nan, said the “model cards” attached to each Nvidia AI model say they were trained on the Books3 dataset.
“We respect the rights of all content creators and believe we created NeMo in full compliance with copyright law,” Nvidia said in a statement.
Databricks recentluy purchased AI company MosaicML, which makes the MPT series of AI models.
Copyright questions
The complaint against Databricks similarly says that public information about MPT shows those models were also trained on Books3 content.
The lawsuits name works including Keene’s 2008 novel Ghost Walk, Nazemian’s 2019 novel Like a Love Story and O’Nan’s 2007 novella Last Night at the Lobster.
Nvidia dominates the market for AI chips and launched its own NeMo models in 2022.
The company has seen its stock price soar in recent months due to high demand for its AI hardware, driving its market capitalisation over $2 trillion (£1.6bn).",https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-innovation/artificial-intelligence/ai-nvidia-training-554019

First reported by Reuters, authors Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian, and Stewart O'Nan allege that one of Nvidia's large datasets used their books to train NeMo, the company's cloud-based toolkit for creating and customizing large language models (LLMs), without author consent. The lawsuit was filed late last week in the U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, with the plaintiffs seeking damages for the use of their novels.
Although Nvidia is best known for its GeForce GTX and RTX line of desktop and laptop graphics cards, over the last several years, Nvidia has become a dominant force in artificial intelligence across both software and hardware markets. Nvidia's AI dominance helped the company reach a $2 trillion market cap late last month.
Nvidia declined to comment on the lawsuit.
AI Training and Copyright Law
With the filing of this lawsuit, Nvidia joins a growing list of tech companies that are being sued over how it uses datasets to train its AI tech. Generative AI products like OpenAI's ChatGPT-3 or Google Bard require a substantial amount of data to train them, which has become a hot subject in copyright law as many, particularly creative professionals like artists and authors, take legal action for their work being used to train these technologies without their consent.
Other AI-related copyrighted lawsuits include OpenAI, which is being sued by 18 authors, including Game of Thrones author George R R. Martin, for copyright infringement. Both Meta and Microsoft also face legal action in the same realm; the former used copyrighted books to train its LLMs, while Microsoft (and OpenAI) are being sued by The New York Times for alleged ""unauthorized use of published work"" to train its AI tech.
With many lawsuits filed within the last year, artificial intelligence may be a key component in changing United States copyright law. Tech companies argue that AI training is no different from how humans learn new things and that it is protected under ""fair use."" In contrast, plaintiffs in these lawsuits argue that the lack of consent for using their work for AI training is a misuse of their work.

Authors Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian, and Stewart O’Nan sue Nvidia for alleged copyright infringement in training its NeMo AI platform. The authors claim Nvidia used their books without permission in a dataset, later taken down for copyright issues.
Nvidia is currently embroiled in a legal dispute as three authors, Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian, and Stewart O’Nan, filed a lawsuit against the company. The authors allege that Nvidia used their copyrighted books without authorisation for the training of its NeMo AI platform.
According to the authors, Nvidia employed their works as part of a dataset, consisting of approximately 196,640 volumes, to train NeMo in the simulation of written language. Despite the dataset being removed in October 2023 following copyright infringement reports, the authors argue that Nvidia’s acknowledgement of training NeMo on the dataset constitutes a breach of copyright.
In response, the authors are seeking unspecified damages on behalf of US writers whose copyrighted materials were utilised in the past three years to train NeMo’s extensive language models. This request is part of a proposed class action filed in federal court in San Francisco, citing works such as ‘Ghost Walk’ by Keene, ‘Like a Love Story’ by Nazemian, and ‘Last Night at the Lobster’ by O’Nan.
Why does this matter?
This legal action places Nvidia among the companies facing legal scrutiny regarding generative AI technology, which generates new content based on diverse inputs. NeMo, known for its rapid and cost-effective adoption of generative AI, has drawn attention from both creators and litigators.

NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50-series ""Blackwell"" to use 28 Gbps GDDR7 Memory Speed
The first round of NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50-series ""Blackwell"" graphics cards that implement GDDR7 memory are rumored to come with a memory speed of 28 Gbps, according to kopite7kimi, a reliable source with NVIDIA leaks. This is despite the fact that the first GDDR7 memory chips will be capable of 32 Gbps speeds. NVIDIA will also stick with 16 Gbit densities for the GDDR7 memory chips, which means memory sizes could remain largely unchanged for the next generation; with the 28 Gbps GDDR7 memory chips providing 55% higher bandwidth over 18 Gbps GDDR6 and 33% higher bandwidth than 21 Gbps GDDR6X. It remains to be seen what memory bus widths NVIDIA chooses for its individual SKUs.
NVIDIA's decision to use 28 Gbps as its memory speeds has some precedent in recent history. The company's first GPUs to implement GDDR6, the RTX 20-series ""Turing,"" opted for 14 Gbps speeds despite 16 Gbps GDDR6 chips being available. 28 Gbps is exactly double that speed. Future generations of GeForce RTX GPUs, or even refreshes within the RTX 50-series could see NVIDIA opt for higher memory speeds such as 32 Gbps. When the standard debuts, companies like Samsung even plan to put up fast 36 Gbps chips. Besides a generational doubling in speeds, GDDR7 is more energy-efficient as it operates at lower voltages than GDDR6. It also uses a more advanced PAM3 physical layer signaling compared to NRZ for JEDEC-standard GDDR6.

;-)
Let's hope AMD and nvidia don't intentionally allign once again their lineups, so that Radeon RX 8700 XT is 10% faster than RX 7800 XT, and RTX 5060 is 5% faster than RTX 4060.
That will be a disaster, but at the same time the gamers will save some money because those lineups will make the negative buying decisions much easier.
Lovely.
We can all keep enjoying the endless ‘not enough memory vs it just allocating’ and you ‘want to be future proof vs by than your fps will tank anyway’ for another episode.
Also, NV must keep the 32gbps variant for the upcoming ‘super’ 5xxx series.
- approx. $2000 RTX 5080, which will be faster than RTX 4090 (""so youre getting your money's worth"", reviewers will be paid to say)
- a tier above that will be a new ""Titan"" class card, but aimed at ""Home AI acceleration"". Price? Sky is the limit.
Now every time nvidia farts we get a new post..
A monolithic chip is smaller individually but that's essentially irrelevant given that chiplets are larger horizontally. It does not make the chip extend beyond the height of caps for example and does not increase size requirements for devices. The larger chiplet based design would be easier to cool as well. Of course both of the above depend on the exact chiplet design, Intel's chiplets for example are much closer together so the size difference between it and a monolithic design is going to be less.
Of course chiplets also allow modularity, superior binning (each individual chiplet on a die can be binned), chips to exceed the reticle limit, they are cheaper to produce, and they have higher yield as compared to the same chip in a monolithic design.
AMD has 3 chiplet designs for it's entire CPU lineup: The IO die, Zen 4 core die, and the Zen 4c core die. Meanwhile Intel needs dozens of designs to address the same markets.
This is why Intel is switching to chiplet, it's just better.
unless they come up with GDDR7X again like G5X and G6X before just for a buzzword and otherwise nothingburger
Please, don't tell me fairy tales. Why did AMD abandon the failed Navi 41? Because the chiplet approach doesn't work and they leave large portions of performance on the table. That's because Intel is a large corporation and it can afford it. I, for one, also support the idea that it must cut at least 50% of the projects because they are not necessary and instead waste time and money.
1) They already have a sky-high priced RTX6000 ADA, which is an almost fully unlocked AD102 with 48GB - exactly what one would want for ""home AI acceleration."" They're charging $7000 for it and it's consistently out of stock.
2) They can charge even more by allocating their production towards dedicated AI chips! Those go for 15k+ while the actual die size is around the same. Sure, packaging costs, even more memory and all that but, you know, that's where the margins are.
At the end of the day I wouldn't be too surprised if they stopped bothering with gaming altogether. IMHO this might end up even worse than mining for home GPU market - that stuff went in cycles, miners weren't paying 20k for a card even in the worst moments and they wanted the same product as we do. AI people want a different product - and they can pay the price for it, hogging up all the supply they can get. If they keep doing that - where's the incentive to sell us the cards or make them better? Even high-end will become like mid- and low-end already has, with measly +5-10% boosts every couple of years.
Of course at one point chiplets will be a necessity because of rising costs but I don't think of that as a positive for consumers. It's going to be all about increasing margins. That's not really true, is it? AMD also uses monolithic CPUs.
The GCD of Navi 31 is smaller and the MCDs are tiny, for all we know it could very well be cheaper even if the total die space used is higher. I'd like to point out that AMD is whopping Intel in the server and enterprise space and has the fastest consumer desktop processors as well. To me it seems you are purposefully ignoring things that don't favor your point.
AMD pointed out why they could not yet scale up their GPUs, bandwidth. You are implying that a company is wasting money for the fun of it. I'm sure their CEO and shareholders would highly disagree. The X3D CPUs absolutely prove this false. The binning of the 5950X does as well. The 7900 XTX has a die size of 304mm2 and the MCDs have a size of 34mm2. The cost is similar to that of a mid-ranged GPU. RDNA3 doesn't reach 4090 level performance because AMD was unable to get a 2nd GCD working. Nvidia wrote a paper in 2017 about how chiplets are better FYI.
Nvidia can afford to build expensive monoliths, because AI will gobble up anything (and likes efficiency). AMD... just tries to play catch up.
Intel hasn't moved to chiplets and I doubt they have plans about it.
DG2-512 - monolithic design
DG2-128 - monolithic design
Nvidia as well:
(future) GB202 - monolithic design
(future) GB203 - monolithic design
(future) GB205 - monolithic design
(future) GB206 - monolithic design
(future) GB207 - monolithic design
AD102 - monolithic design
AD103 - monolithic design
AD104 - monolithic design
AD106 - monolithic design
AD107 - monolithic design
AMD:
(future) Navi 40 larger - monolithic design
(future) Navi 40 smaller - monolithic design
Navi 31 - non-monolithic design
Navi 32 - non-monolithic design
Navi 33 - monolithic design
Navi 21 - monolithic design
Navi 22 - monolithic design
Navi 23 - monolithic design
Navi 24 - monolithic design
What is possible - Navi 31 and Navi 32 are the first and last chiplet designs.
Much like AMD's previous mistake with HBM which they no longer use, or the abandoned multi-GPU / MCM products
I am all for faster and more efficient memory, we really need it as we keep having higher and higher density requirements.

Nvidia is facing legal trouble from a trio of authors, who claim the company used copyrighted books to train one of its AI models.
The US dispute – first reported by Reuters – involves authors Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian and Stewart O’Nan, who claim their works were included in a dataset used to train NeMo, a Nvidia framework that is designed to build and customise generative AI models.
This dataset was taken down last October for reported copyright infringement. The three authors are seeking damages for copyrighted works that helped train NeMo’s large language models in the last three years, Reuters reports. The copyright dispute was filed with the US District Court for the Northern District of California.
AI v copyright
The case is the latest in the growing issue of copyright infringement for AI companies. Last year saw a number of authors file suits against both OpenAI and Meta, with claims that their AI models used their books as training material.
Those lawsuits claimed the large language models developed by Meta and OpenAI were trained on illegal “shadow libraries” – websites that contain pirated versions of the authors’ books.
Last year also saw thousands sign a letter written by the US Authors Guild, calling on the likes of OpenAI, Alphabet and Meta to stop using their work to train AI models without “consent, credit or compensation”.
Towards the end of 2023, The New York Times stepped into the ring with a high-profile lawsuit against both OpenAI and Microsoft. The media outlet claimed AI models such as ChatGPT have copied and use millions of copyrighted news articles, in-depth investigations and other journalistic work.
In January, OpenAI said it was “surprised and disappointed” by the lawsuit and added the newspaper was “not telling the full story”. It followed up in February with a claim that The New York Times “paid someone to hack OpenAI’s products” to generate “highly anomalous results” used as evidence in its AI copyright case.
In a statement sent to SiliconRepublic.com, Ian Crosby, a partner at Susman Godfrey and lead counsel for The New York Times, noted that OpenAI did not dispute that it copied millions of articles from the media outlet to build its products.
OpenAI is also facing a class-action lawsuit filed last year, which claims the company scraped the internet to train its generative AI chatbot and potentially violated the rights of millions as a result.

NVIDIA AI Products Have Catalyzed Their Growth In The Markets; They Don't Look To Stop Just Yet
Team Green doesn't look to stop with the massive AI gold mine that it discovered last year, and with what the indicators show, the party doesn't look to stop just yet. The report comes from none other than Bloomberg, which predicts that NVIDIA's revenue by 2026 could grow to $130 billion, almost an additional $100 billion from 2021. This is a humongous 125% gain in overall revenue, and these figures are some that the industry has never witnessed in the past, all courtesy of the vast AI demand backed by data centers and AI accelerator demand.
Based on what we have reported previously, it seems that NVIDIA is on track to generate $300 billion from AI-driven sales by 2027, adding a massive chunk to its gigantic market cap. Market researchers such as Omdia have shown similar optimism, with the firm expected to make $87 billion this year from its data center GPUs, marking a 150% YoY increment. Now, things are looking on the right track for the upcoming years, with Team Green announcing plans to unveil its next-generation ""Blackwell"" B100 AI GPUs and various other server offerings soon, which will ultimately catalyze their growth in the markets.
NVIDIA plans to integrate liquid-cooling capabilities within its data centers in another exciting development. This shows how the firm plans to bring generational improvements into its AI products, ultimately catering to the immense demand from the AI sector, which requires generational improvement in computing power. However, it is essential to note that these figures are merely projections and could be heavily impacted by geo-political conditions, supply chain constraints, and the potential increase in industry competition. For now, NVIDIA is reigning the markets.

Nvidia, whose chips power artificial intelligence, has been sued by three US authors who said it used their copyrighted books without permission to train its NeMo AI platform.
Brian Keene, Abdi Nazemian and Stewart O’Nan said their works were part of a data set of about 196,640 books that helped train NeMo to simulate ordinary written language, before being taken down in October “due to reported copyright infringement”.
In a proposed class action filed on Friday night in San Francisco federal court, the authors said the takedown reflects Nvidia’s having “admitted” it trained NeMo on the data set, and thereby infringed their copyrights.

They are seeking unspecified damages for people in the United States whose copyrighted works helped train NeMo’s so-called large language models in the past three years.
Among the works covered by the lawsuit are Keene’s 2008 novel Ghost Walk, Nazemian’s 2019 novel Like a Love Story, and O’Nan’s 2007 novella Last Night at the Lobster.

NVIDIA Blackwell ""GB203"" GPU Could Sport 256-bit Memory Interface
Speculative NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50-series ""GB20X"" GPU memory interface details appeared online late last week—as disclosed by the kopite7kimi social media account. The inside information aficionado—at the time—posited that the ""memory interface configuration of GB20x (Blackwell) is not much different from that of AD10x (Ada Lovelace)."" It was inferred that Team Green's next flagship gaming GPU (GB202) could debut with a 384-bit memory bus—kopite7kimi had ""fantasized"" about a potentially monstrous 512-bit spec for the ""GeForce RTX 5090."" A new batch of follow-up tweets—from earlier today—rips apart last week's insights. The alleged Blackwell GPU gaming lineup includes the following SKUs: GB202, GB203, GB205, GB206, GB207.
Kopite7kimi's revised thoughts point to Team Green's flagship model possessing 192 streaming multiprocessors and a 512-bit memory bus. VideoCardz decided to interact with the reliable tipster—their queries were answered promptly: ""According to kopite7kimi, there's a possibility that the second-in-line GPU, named GB203, could sport half of that core count. Now the new information is that GB203 might stick to 256-bit memory bus, which would make it half of GB202 in its entirety. What this also means is that there would be no GB20x GPU with 384-bit bus."" Additional speculation has NVIDIA selecting a 192-bit bus for the GB205 SKU (AKA GeForce RTX 5070). The GeForce RTX 50-series is expected to arrive later this year—industry experts are already whispering about HPC-oriented Blackwell GPUs being unveiled at next week's GTC 2024 event. A formal gaming family announcement could arrive many months later.

As for Sport vs support the context in which it used fits as its saying that is likely what gpu is gonna be vs its possible to support xxx.
The title is fine.
Nvidia is predictable, most already knew.
lets hope Nvidia keeps it reasonable $999/1999 5080/90 /w 12032/22016 cudas. But i can't see 5080 leading to 4090 in ratser with this spec. 25% faster memory and 25% more shaders spells a very weak 80 class gen on gen improvement. In RT RT is different but who cares.
But knowing that Nvidia made a mistake with 1080ti pricing it 699, 2080 ti correction to $1199, then again 3080 $699, 4080 $1199, who knows. Can they perhaps go for a 699 5070 256 bit. In 2025 a 12 GB 192 bit 5070 doesn't make any sense.
Double the CUs in GB202 seems insane. Can't wait to see the price. :D",https://www.techpowerup.com/320254/nvidia-blackwell-gb203-gpu-could-sport-256-bit-memory-interface

Patch makes GTX 1600 and RTX 2000 GPUs faster – but it’s not without risks
Nvidia GTX 16 and RTX 20 series GPUs can get a bit of a performance boost thanks to a new mod that brings the Resizable BAR (or ReBAR) feature to these graphics cards.
A quick refresher: ReBAR first came to light at the turn of the decade as AMD’s Smart Access Memory feature, which tweaks PCIe’s Resizable BAR to lift certain limitations on the memory front to boost performance by a decent chunk in some games (we’ll come back to that).
Nvidia and Intel adopted ReBAR too, but in the case of Team Green, support was only offered with RTX 3000 graphics cards, with the previous-gen products at the time left out in the cold.
Enter the new invention from developer ‘Terminatorul’: a UEFI driver that allows ReBAR to work with older GTX 1600 and RTX 2000 graphics cards.
As Tom’s Hardware reports, the tool in question is called NvStrapsReBar and it patches your motherboard’s UEFI firmware to be able to set the resizable BAR size to chase slightly faster frame rates with these GPUs.
As good as this idea sounds in principle, there are some sizeable catches here, which means this is an endeavor best left well alone for most folks – and we’ll explore that next.
Analysis: Risk versus reward
The task of patching the motherboard in this way has risks, and if something goes wrong, that could be really bad news for your PC (we’re talking about bricking the thing territory). With this being an unofficial fudge for ReBAR support, we really would not recommend trying this, unless you are very tech-savvy and confident with what you’re doing.
Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.
Even then, we’d still advise against it, because with relatively old Nvidia GPUs like these models, the gains that ReBAR will provide are likely to be on the meager side. Whereas SAM for AMD GPUs did usher in some sizeable frame rate boosts in some PC games, in this particular scenario, you’re probably looking at minor gains of not much at all (a few percent extra frames per second).
Yes, you might get a touch more with certain games, but it’ll be a bit of a lottery – equally, you could see no improvement whatsoever, or even a slight negative impact perhaps. There are just too many unknowns, and an off-kilter risk-reward balance, with going this route in our opinion, given the potential dangers of a major hardware failure as mentioned.
Still, the option is there for those who want to take it, and more choice is never a bad thing.

MESA Adds Long-Awaited Sparse Memory Support On NVIDIA's NVK Vulkan Driver, Adding More Games To Be Played On The Platform
Sparse memory is a term defined to focus on memory management, which involves using mathematical equations to allocate data to ensure a higher efficiency than traditional methods, along with providing a faster retrieval time. The adoption of sparse memory has increased recently as more gaming titles begin to make it mandatory. In light of this, NVIDIA's NVK Vulkan driver has added support for the memory management feature, ensuring a seamless experience for Linux gamers.
Phoronix reports that NVIDIA's NVK driver feature sparse memory support will have a massive contribution towards the future of the platform in the domain of gaming since several games within the Linux ecosystems, such as those on Steam Play that utilize DXVK and VKD3D-Proton, have sparse memory added in as a primary requirement. We have yet to see the inclusion of support from AMD's camp, but judging by how the open-source developer MESA is proceeding with AMD's Vulkan driver, we expect it to arrive soon.
Linux is turning out to be in a state that makes it a viable alternative to mainstream operating systems, especially if you are out for open-source development. However, on the gaming side, SteamOS is the primary platform to adopt Linux through a compatibility layer; hence, that too is leveraging the development being done on the platform, and with the addition of sparse memory support on NVIDIA's NVK, the gaming experience is undoubtedly going to level up.

Outside of the flagship GB202 die, Nvidia may stick with the same memory bus widths as the RTX 40-series.
GPU detective Kopite7kimi on X suggests that Nvidia's upcoming RTX 50-series ""Blackwell"" GB203 and new GB205 dies will feature the same memory bus widths as Nvidia's outgoing RTX 40-series AD103 and AD104 GPU dies — those are found in the likes of the RTX 4080 Super and the RTX 4070 Super, some of the best graphics cards.
Kopite7kimi's latest post appears to be a confirmation of what he said a few days ago, regarding Blackwell's memory bus sizes. Instead of widening or shortening the bus-width of its RTX 50-series GPUs, Kopite believes that Nvidia is content with the memory bus-width configurations it's using on its RTX 40-series Ada Lovelace GPUs and will translate those to its new GPUs based on the Blackwell architecture.
Kopite specifically states that at least two Blackwell's GPUs, GB203 and GB205, will share the same memory bus widths as their predecessors. GB203 will be the direct successor to AD103 used in the RTX 4080 series and the RTX 4070 Ti Super featuring a 256-bit interface. GB205 is more of an oddball, since there have been no ""205"" class GPUs in the past, but it is rumored to be a brand new GPU model that will not directly succeed AD104. Nonetheless, Kopite believes it will sport the same memory configuration as AD104 found in the RTX 4070 series and RTX 4070 Ti sporting a 192-bit interface.
There's no mention of a GB204 die, however, which would logically fall between the GB203 and GB205 in terms of specs. Perhaps Nvidia will skip that potential GPU completely, just as it didn't have ""AD105"" or ""GA105"" GPUs for the past two generations. All of these are rumors and speculations, of course, so take everything with a healthy dose of skepticism.
Thanks as always. GB203 is 256-bit and GB205 is 192-bit.March 12, 2024

What does this mean in terms of real-world performance? Not much on its own. We believe Nvidia will be transitioning to the GDDR7 graphics memory standard with the RTX 50-series. GDDR7 is a brand-new standard that was formalized by JEDEC just a week ago, featuring twice the bandwidth potential of GDDR6X (let alone GDDR6).
GDDR7's immense bandwidth potential will allow Nvidia to reduce/reuse its outgoing memory interfaces on its next-generation GPUs while at the same time substantially boosting bandwidth. Combined with larger L2/L3 cache sizes, that's one reason memory interface widths have been shrinking in recent years on both Nvidia and AMD GPUs. Larger caches and newer memory technologies will enable Nvidia to reduce the bus width while increasing effective memory bandwidth.
It's also important to point out that GDDR7 opens the door to several other potential upgrades. While GDDR6 (and GDDR6X) topped out at a theoretical 32Gb capacity per chip (4GB), GDDR7 will support up to 64Gb (8GB) memory sizes. That's probably a ways off, and most GDDR6 solutions are still using 16Gb (2GB) devices.
Perhaps more importantly, GDDR7 also supports non-power-of-two capacities like 24Gb and 48Gb, and Samsung and Micron have already indicated their initial GDDR7 devices will top out at 16Gb/24Gb. The use of 24Gb (3GB) devices would mean the GB203 could support up to 24GB and GB205 could support up to 18GB, with GB206/207 supporting 12GB. That would go a long way towards alleviating concerns about VRAM capacity, even if the memory bus widths stay the same.

usertests This story seems disjointed. 512-bit is mentioned in the headline and then nowhere else.Reply
A fun move might be 512-bit 5090 with 32 GB, then the next generation they dial it back to 384-bit, but with an increase to 36 GB since 24 Gb GDDR7 will be ready by then.
The 512-bit rumor contradicts previous rumors of 384-bit and 24 GB. Nvidia could be putting out misleading info behind the scenes again to trick leakers. -

Intel Gaudi2 Accelerator Beats NVIDIA H100 at Stable Diffusion 3 by 55%
Stability AI, the developers behind the popular Stable Diffusion generative AI model, have run some first-party performance benchmarks for Stable Diffusion 3 using popular data-center AI GPUs, including the NVIDIA H100 ""Hopper"" 80 GB, A100 ""Ampere"" 80 GB, and Intel's Gaudi2 96 GB accelerator. Unlike the H100, which is a super-scalar CUDA+Tensor core GPU; the Gaudi2 is purpose-built to accelerate generative AI and LLMs. Stability AI published its performance findings in a blog post, which reveals that the Intel Gaudi2 96 GB is posting a roughly 56% higher performance than the H100 80 GB.
With 2 nodes, 16 accelerators, and a constant batch size of 16 per accelerator (256 in all), the Intel Gaudi2 array is able to generate 927 images per second, compared to 595 images for the H100 array, and 381 images per second for the A100 array, keeping accelerator and node counts constant. Scaling things up a notch to 32 nodes, and 256 accelerators or a batch size of 16 per accelerator (total batch size of 4,096), the Gaudi2 array is posting 12,654 images per second; or 49.4 images per-second per-device; compared to 3,992 images per second or 15.6 images per-second per-device for the older-gen A100 ""Ampere"" array.There is a big caveat to this, and that is the results were obtained using the base PyTorch; Stability AI admits that with the TensorRT optimization, A100 chips produce images up to 40% faster than Gaudi2. ""On inference tests with the Stable Diffusion 3 8B parameter model the Gaudi2 chips offer inference speed similar to Nvidia A100 chips using base PyTorch. However, with TensorRT optimization, the A100 chips produce images 40% faster than Gaudi2. We anticipate that with further optimization, Gaudi2 will soon outperform A100s on this model. In earlier tests on our SDXL model with base PyTorch, Gaudi2 generates a 1024x1024 image in 30 steps in 3.2 seconds, versus 3.6 seconds for PyTorch on A100s and 2.7 seconds for a generation with TensorRT on an A100."" Stability AI credits the faster interconnect and larger 96 GB memory as making the Intel chips competitive.
Stability AI plans to implement the Gaudi2 into Stability Cloud.

I don't really know all that much about the data center specific hardware like this though, it could just be than Intel has the better overall solution and you know what, good on them too.
There are several versions of NVIDIA x100-series accelerators, that is Non-PCI-e and PCI-e, and it is Not clear what was actually used.
NVIDIA A100 accelerators are almost 4-year-old ( released in 2020 ).
Tests using PyTorch instead of TensorRT can Not be considered seriously for NVIDIA x100-series accelerators.
The 1st test for Intel Gaudi2 uses twice more accelerators than NVIDIA accelerators ( 32 vs. 16 / final results, that is images per sec, should be normalized ).
>>...Stability AI admits that with the TensorRT optimization, A100 chips produce images up to 40% faster than Gaudi2...
Once again, Tests using PyTorch instead of TensorRT can Not be considered seriously for NVIDIA x100-series accelerators.

Three novelists sued the company for alleged copyright infringement, arguing that Nvidia has used their work to train its model and has therefore violated their books' copyright protections.
The authors argue that Nvidia's NeMo Megatron-GPT, first released in September 2022, copies and draws from their books ""without consent, without credit, and without compensation.""
""During training, the LLM copies and ingests each textual work in the training dataset and extracts protected expression from it,"" the complaint reads.
The lawsuit states that Nvidia's NeMo Megatron large language model (LLM) was trained on EleutherAI's dataset, dubbed ""The Pile,"" which consists of 800GB of data including 108GB worth of books. The Pile's books component is also referred to as ""Books3,"" which is reportedly made up of more than 196,000 books on ""Bibliotik"" and includes those of the authors who filed the lawsuit.
Bibliotik is a login-gated ""shadow library"" of copyrighted books, and Books3 creator Shawn Presser has previously confirmed that Bibliotik's entire library was used to make the AI dataset. In October 2023, Books3 was subsequently removed from AI data site Hugging Face over copyright concerns, but NeMo continues to use this dataset, the lawsuit argues.
The suit's plaintiffs—novelists Abdi Nazemian, Brian Keene, and Stewart O'Nan—are seeking damages and requesting a class-action lawsuit so that all other authors whose work was included in the Books3 dataset can join the suit against Nvidia.
Reached for comment, an Nvidia spokesperson told PCMag via email: ""We respect the rights of all content creators and believe we created NeMo in full compliance with copyright law.""
This lawsuit comes as AI tech firms see their stock prices soar to all-time highs while artists grow increasingly frustrated that their names and work are being used to train AI models without their permission and without being paid.
Nvidia isn't the only tech firm with an AI model that's being accused of copyright infringement, though. The New York Times's copyright lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft over ChatGPT is ongoing. And in the past week, multiple artists have raised concerns that generative AI image tool Midjourney is using their unique styles to create outputs that pull from their bodies of work without their consent, calling it ""dehumanizing"" and disrespectful.

North West Repair fixes card after thermal material seeped under the GPU and two GDDR6X chips.
North West Repair has ably demonstrated that ""death by liquid metal"" isn't necessarily permanent. After analyzing and diagnosing a deceased Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090, the repair tech demonstrated dexterous GPU and VRAM chip removal, cleaning, reballing, replacement, and testing. Except for one of the VRAM chips requiring its solder balls to be reflowed a second time, the repair went without a hitch, and his customer must have been happy to get back a fully working (and still potent in 2024) GeForce RTX 3090.
Liquid metal thermal interface material (TIM) is notoriously tricky to handle, with commercial applications using specially designed application tools and barriers to stop it escaping from where it's needed. Asus, for example, is known to use solder mask on nearby conductive surfaces and a tiny barrier sponge just 0.1mm tall around processor sockets. Unlike the long-established oxide thermal pastes, liquid metal conducts electricity, so if it seeps out it can cause all sorts of electrical havoc (usually short circuits). This seems to be exactly what has happened to the RTX 3090 in the North West Repair video.
In the video, repairer Tony explains that he received an Nvidia Founders Edition GeForce RTX 3090 ""after an unsuccessful liquid metal application."" He seems to be wary of such cases, recommending good-quality thermal paste instead. The first job is to check the graphics card isn't completely dead, and to assess the spread of the liquid metal. It is 'known' to be under the GPU – but did it get into any other nooks and crannies?
A multimeter confirmed that most circuits were OK, but the card wouldn't output any video signal. The next step, connecting the card to run tests on its memory banks, revealed that two GDDR6X chips were causing errors. Knowing liquid metal got under the core, it was suspected that it went under from the upper-left side, affecting the two marked memory chips.
Tony then got to work, using specialized equipment to evenly heat the GPU and memory chips to around 250 degrees Celsius. This allowed the spill-affected components to be removed. Next, the cleanup process began, and North West Repair noted an unusual coating on the freshly exposed PCB area that had to be cleaned with adhesive remover.
The next segment of the video shows the GPU and two VRAM chips getting cleaned and solder re-balled, which is a tricky specialized task. Tony makes this look easy though. After the successful component re-ball, the components were soldered back to the graphics card PCB for testing. As we mentioned in the intro, one of the memory chips precipitated an error in the text phase, so the problematic chip got a fresh squirt of flux and was reheated to the solder melting point, for an operation called a reflow.
After a last spell of cleaning, using an ultrasonic bath to remove old dried-up flux residue, the GeForce RTX 3090 card was ready for testing again and passed all Tony's heat, stress, and benchmark testing. It was a happy ending for a card that easily could have been tossed in the trash after the owner's very expensive mistake.

Nvidia stock price opened at $951.38 per share level and went on to touch a new high of $974 apiece on Nasdaq during Friday deals. However, Nvidia stock failed to sustain at higher levels after the profit-booking trigger, which further deepened following the selling pressure in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices.
According to stock market experts, Nvidia stock price crashed after climbing to a new peak on Friday because of the selling pressure in the S&P 500 index and tech-heavy Nasdaq index. They said that selling pressure in these Wall Street indices was caused by disappointing US job data that dampened the US fed rate cut buzz. Apart from this, dips in sales and weak quarterly numbers of the US auto majors — Tesla, Broadcom, and Costco — was another reason for the Nvidia stock price fall on Friday.
Speaking on the reasons that triggered selling pressure in Nvidia stocks, Sandeep Pandey, Founder of Basav Capital said, ""Nvidia is a chip maker company, which draws a good amount of business from American auto majors Tesla, Costco, and Broadcom. All these three companies have delivered weak quarterly numbers and all these three auto majors witnessed sharp selling pressure on Friday. This led to profit-booking trigger in Nvidia share price at record high levels.""
On why Nividia stock price witnessed sharp selling after the profit-booking trigger, Avinash Gorakshkar, Head of Research at Profitmart Securities said, ""Nvidia stocks are the AI poster boy of the US stock market. It registered a sharp upside move in 2024 and now it is the third largest S&P 500 company after Microsoft and Apple. Selling in NVidia stocks deepened on Friday because of the disappointing US job data and rise in the US unemployment data. This dampened the US Fed rate cut buzz, which triggered profit-booking and panic selling in the US stock market. That's why Nvidia stock price tumbled further after the profit-booking trigger at record higher levels.""
On Nvidia stock price outlook, Sandeep Pandey of Profitmart Securities said, ""Nvidia stock price has made a strong base in the $810 to $815 per share range. Those who have Nvidia stocks in the portfolio, are advised to maintain a strict stop loss below $810 level.""
On whether it is an opportunity for bottom fishing, Sandeep Pandey of Basav Capital advised fresh investors to wait as the stock may correct more if the US Fed officials talk hawkish on interest rates.
Despite the over 5.50 percent crash in Nvidia stock price on Friday, the AI poster boy of the US stock market is one of those stocks in the US stock market that have delivered stellar returns to investors. In the last one month, Nvidia stock price has ascended over 20 percent while in the last six months, it has risen over 90 percent. In YTD, Nvidia share price has shot up from $481.68 per share to $875.28 apiece level, logging a nearly 80 percent rise in 2024. However, in the last one year, Nvidia stock price has appreciated from $234.36 per share level to $875.28 per share mark, delivering to the tune of 275 percent return to its investors.

Micron's HBM3E Process Gains Superiority Over Competitors, As The Firm Becomes a Primary Supplier For NVIDIA's Next-Gen Products
Korean media reports that Team Green's decision to opt for Micron's HBM3e process for its H200 AI GPU has stirred up a new debate among HBM manufacturers as Micron grasps the holy grail of next-gen markets.
Micron's 24 GB 8H HBM3E will be part of NVIDIA's upcoming H200 AI accelerator, marking a massive achievement for the company, lagging significantly behind SK hynix and Samsung. Micron's superiority in the HBM3E process proved vital for the firm's agreement with NVIDIA, so things would favor the company. Here is how Micron describes the capabilities of its HBM3e process:
- Superior Performance: With pin speed greater than 9.2 gigabits per second (Gb/s), Micron's HBM3E delivers more than 1.2 terabytes per second (TB/s) of memory bandwidth, enabling lightning-fast data access for AI accelerators, supercomputers, and data centers.
- Exceptional Efficiency: HBM3E leads the industry with ~30% lower power consumption compared to competitive offerings. To support increasing demand and usage of AI, HBM3E offers maximum throughput with the lowest levels of power consumption to improve important data center operational expense metrics.
- Seamless Scalability: With 24 GB of capacity today, HBM3E allows data centers to seamlessly scale their AI applications. Whether for training massive neural networks or accelerating inferencing tasks, Micron's solution provides the necessary memory bandwidth.
However, Micron gaining NVIDIA's trust doesn't mean the firm would gain the edge over the segment's behemoth SK hynix. It was just reported recently that SK hynix sent out its 12-layer HBM3E type for qualification tests to NVIDIA, which means that the firm could be included in the pool of suppliers of Team Green's upcoming AI solutions, and judging by the fact that SK hynix has been a massive customer of NVIDIA, it's doubtful that we will see Micron taking its place, although the balances could tip off when it comes to market shares, since as of now, SK hynix retains an overall 54% share of the HBM industry.
However, one thing is sure: with how the HBM markets are evolving, we will witness a high-competition segment, with the likes of SK hynix, Micron, and Samsung Foundry battling to gain the market's throne. Each firm involved will need to scale up in terms of production volumes it can offer, along with the respective price-to-performance ratios with its HBM processes.

More good news for RTX 5090
The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 has long since been a hot topic in the tech rumor mill as possibly the best graphics card in the future market, with the latest ones revealing even more information about its memory specifications.
According to well-known and reliable Twitter hardware leaker Kopite7kimi, the RTX 5090 will feature a 512-bit memory bus that is 33% wider than the one on Nvidia’s RTX 4090. This would allow for higher levels of memory bandwidth and increased GPU memory capabilities. It could even have 32GB of VRAM thanks to its two 16GB GDDR modules.
There’s also a report that the RTX 5090 will have 28Gbps GDDR7 memory modules, 33% faster than the 21Gbps memory modules in the RTX 4090. But what’s most impressive is the memory bandwidth for the alleged card, an apparent 77% boost compared to the 4090 that would give it 1,800 GB/s of memory bandwidth. This checks out with a previous rumor stating that the card would be up to 70% faster than the 4090.
If this RTX 5090 turns out to be true, the specs would be absolutely mind-blowing and would nearly justify what would certainly be a massive price hike compared to current-gen Nvidia cards.
The RTX 5090 could be in trouble
What’s interesting is that other memory producers have been promoting 32Gbps GDDR7 modules, meaning that if these rumors are true then Nvidia is purposefully slowing down the graphics cards to reduce costs and increase yields. But thanks to the Super series refresh of Nvidia cards, we could possibly see an updated version without these restrictions.
However, there seems to be one major caveat, which is the release date. It seems that Nvidia’s 5090 will be released in 2025, meaning that the rumored Nvidia RTX 4090 Super and RTX Titan would have to keep Team Green’s lead until then. A prospect made much more difficult by AMD.
Team Red is prepping its own comeback with the mid-range RDNA 4 graphics cards, which are shaping up to be Nvidia RTX 4080 and 4060 Ti killers. Of course, it’s possible for it to also be released in 2025, but if it comes out before Team Green’s RTX 5000-series then Team Red will still have a major advantage.

On Friday, Nvidia staged an astonishing reversal. The stock price dived from a 5% increase to a sharp drop of more than 5%, and the intraday amplitude reached 10%. Due to Nvidia's current huge market capitalization, this single-day decline also erased the market capitalization of about 130 billion US dollars in one fell swoop — making it one of the biggest declines in single-day market capitalization in the history of the US stock market.
Following Nvidia's pullback on Friday, the conversation about whether the company's bubble has burst continues to dominate the screen.
Is the “Cisco Hour” here?
In fact, over the past few months, voices have persisted about the bubble caused by Nvidia's sharp rise in stock prices.
At a time when Nvidia's stock price was falling, Cathie Wood, the sister of Mudou, known as Wall Street's “female stock god,” made a remarkable statement in a letter to shareholders.
She compared Nvidia to Cisco in the era of the internet bubble, saying that Nvidia's “Cisco moment” has arrived.
However, Morgan Stanley does not agree with the above views. The bank pointed out in its latest report that from a valuation perspective, today's Nvidia is far different from Cisco back then. The line wrote,
Looking back at Cisco, the representative company during the Internet bubble in 2000, its revenue growth rate at the time reached 59%, while its forward-looking price-earnings ratio was as high as 138 times. In contrast, today Nvidia's price-earnings ratio is only 30 times, yet its revenue growth rate has reached 90%.
Therefore, we cannot assume that the present (Nvidia) is close to the peak of the market, either from a valuation perspective or from a long-term perspective.
The bank also emphasized that the current AI infrastructure investment boom is only in its early stages and has not yet reached the level of the Internet bubble in 1999, and believes that GPU investment has only just begun, and the growth of investment in the supply chain will have a multiplier effect on it.
The internet bubble began in December 1994 and peaked in March 2000, and experienced many pullbacks during this period. Nvidia first raised sales expectations in May 2022, and Chat GPT was only widely discussed in November 2022. In terms of time, we haven't reached the level of the 1999 bubble.
In fact, as I wrote in the previous article, the cheaper Nvidia rises. Although Nvidia's stock price and market capitalization soared, its profit growth rate even surpassed the increase of these two. Nvidia's current valuation (forward PE) is actually cheaper than it was before ChatGPT came out of nowhere.
Currently, Nvidia's dynamic price-earnings ratio is around 35.59, while AMD is 61.73, ARM is 83.33, and Intel is 33.11.
New technology for the Nvidia GTC conference will be launched! Is the stock price expected to burst to the top?
From March 18th to 21st, Nvidia GTC, the annual top AI conference in the world, is about to open.
On March 18 (Monday) at 1 p.m. (Tuesday, March 19 at 4 a.m. Beijing time), Nvidia CEO Huang Renxun will give a speech on the theme “1 #AI峰会 for Developers” (1# AI Conference for Developers).
As one of Nvidia's most important publishing platforms every year, GTC has become a recognized “AI weather vane”. This year's GTC was also held offline for the first time after a lapse of 5 years. According to Nvidia, Hwang In-hoon will release the latest breakthrough results in the fields of accelerated computing, generative AI, and robotics.
The market generally believes that the conference focused on three things: 1. Next-generation Blackwell GPU architecture, 2. The new B100 chip, and 3. Humanoid robots.
According to statistics, in the past 7 annual GTC activities, the probability of Nvidia's rise was as high as 87.5%, and the rise and fall rate during the period was in the range of -0.59% to 21.80%. This means that Nvidia's stock price is expected to continue to rise.
Another catalyst: Is Nvidia's stock split imminent?
Along with the popularity of AI, Nvidia's stock price has soared. In just over two months since the beginning of this year, the market capitalization surged trillion dollars, and its stock price far exceeded the level of the previous stock split.
The last time Nvidia announced the split of 1 share into 4 shares was in May 2021. At that time, its stock price was about 600 US dollars, which is far lower than the current stock price.
The reason for Nvidia's stock split in 2021 was to make it easier for investors and employees to own shares. By July 19 of that year, the day before the stock began trading on the basis of stock splits, the stock had once risen to around $750 per share.
Mike Sansoterra, chief investment officer of Silvant Capital Management LLC, said that on the one hand, the stock split is actually not important because it won't change any value of the company. But on the other hand, individual investors do psychologically prefer to buy $30 instead of $300; they'll give themselves psychological hints that it's cheaper — even though it's definitely not getting cheaper.
Ken Mahoney, President and CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, said:
In the next year or two, I expect Nvidia might split its shares. If Nvidia continues to grow and is on an upward trajectory, then a stock split would make sense. Stock splits will allow individual investors to buy stocks they now think are out of reach.
Cow friends,
Do you think the GTC conference can once again ignite Nvidia's stock price?
Is Nvidia's stock split imminent?

Comino Grando is available in Server and Workstation configurations
Comino, known for its liquid-cooled servers, has finally released its new flagship for testing.
The Comino Grando Server has been designed to meet a broad spectrum of high-performance computing needs, ranging from data analytics to gaming.
In a comprehensive test by StorageReview, the Grando Server, alongside a Grando Workstation variation, was put through a series of rigorous benchmarks including Blender 4.0, Luxmark, OctaneBench, Blackmagic RAW Speed Test, 7-zip Compression, and Y-Cruncher.
The server, equipped with six Nvidia RTX 4090s, AMD's Threadripper PRO 5995WX CPU, 512GB DDR5 DRAM, a 2TB NVMe SSD, and four 1600W PSUs, delivered impressive results, as you’d expect from those specifications.
Grando Server features advanced liquid cooling, allowing it to accommodate those six Nvidia 4090 GPUs side by side, a setup that Lyle Smith from StorageReview noted would be impossible with air cooling.
GPU-driven performance systems done right
The main difference between the Grando Server and Grando Workstation lies in their GPU and CPU capabilities. With its higher core count, the Server model is well-suited for parallel processing tasks. While still powerful, the Workstation offers fewer cores and is better suited for balanced performance across various applications.
The Grando Workstation that Smith tested featured four Nvidia A100 professional GPUs, a Threadripper Pro 3975WX processor, 512GB DDR5 DRAM, and a 2TB NVMe SSD.

When it comes to clock speeds, the RTX 4070 Super takes the lead with a base clock of 1980 MHz and a boost clock of 2475 MHz; surpassing the RTX 3080’s 1440 MHz base and 1710 MHz boost clocks. In terms of transistors, the RTX 4070 Super boasts 35,800 million, outshining the RTX 3080’s 28,300 million. In the power consumption department, the RTX 4070 Super demonstrates efficiency with a TDP of 220 W, while the RTX 3080 draws more power with a TDP of 320 W. Cache sizes, including L1 and L2, exhibit subtle differences but contribute to the overall performance variation between the two cards. So what does this mean in the real world? Utimately, the 4070 Super is moe power efficient, so will cost you less per year. It’s also more powerful and with its superior VRAM gives you more headroom to run games at higher settings and more demanding resolutions. Let’s take a closer look at the performance.
RTX 4070 Super vs RTX 3080 – performance
The RTX 4070 Super, with its superior clock speeds and transistor count, showcases impressive capabilities. The 7,168 shading units contribute to enhanced rendering and graphics processing. However, the RTX 3080, with its higher memory bandwidth, excels in scenarios that demand rapid data access. RTX 4070 Super significantly boosts gaming and creative applications, providing smoother gameplay experiences and faster rendering times. The RTX 3080, on the other hand, remains a formidable competitor, particularly in memory-intensive tasks. A YouTube video from the Mark PC channel runs different games using the two GPUs to see the difference. The result shows that both GPUs have minimal performance difference, with RTX 4070 Super having the upper hand, especially in high–quality graphics. This will likely be due to both the increased VRAM and the improved memory clock when comparing the Super with the 3080.
Out with the old, in with the new
The 4070 Super is a fantastic card, so don’t let it ‘mid range’ tag affect you. The difference between the RTX 3080 is marginal, and for a slightly higher cost you’re getting a card with Ada architecture and a decent increase in VRAM. If you do decide to get a 3080, opt for a 12GB version – which at least gives you more headrooom, although we advise sticking with the 40 Series.
Of course, as is the case with Nvidia GeForce RTX cards, both cards support ray tracing and DLSS. This means graphically intensive games such as Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2 and Hogwarts Legacy will run pretty well on both cards. It’s worth noting that the 10GB 3080 will almost certainly need some of the settings turned down if you’re looking for plus 60FPS in more demanding games.
RTX 4070 Super vs RTX 3080 – price and value
As price often plays a crucial role in consumer decisions, the RTX 4070 Super currently retails for around $599. The RTX 3080, now a couple of years old, can be picked up for less than this, with some models on eBay closer to the $400 mark. This is a far cry from the initial launch price, which topped more than $1000. In our opinion, if evaluating on price alone, we would always opt to pay a little more for the newer hardware. Not only are you getting the latest Ada GPU architecture making this a worthwhile upgrade, but you’re also future-proofing yourself thanks to more visual memory. The choice between the two boils down to individual preferences and budget constraints. Considering the price difference, the RTX 4070 Super delivers excellent value for gamers and content creators seeking high-quality performance without breaking the bank.
Final verdict
Each graphics card has its strengths and weaknesses in the RTX 4070 Super vs RTX 3080 showdown. The RTX 4070 Super impresses with its advanced architecture, competitive specs, and attractive pricing. The RTX 3080 was once a formidable option and the MSRP matched that, but in the advent of Nvidia’s Super cards, the 3080 quickly starts to not make sense for those looking for a serious upgrade in 2025.

With a US$2.2 trillion market capitalization (value of all shares combined), it is now bigger than Alphabet. This all came upon us very quickly. In October of 2022, NVDA stock traded at $119 – a mere 13% of today’s stock price. Today, it trades for $875.
The question investors need to ask themselves is, is NVDA stock a buy today? At this point, NVIDIA has risen so much in price that it might be getting overvalued. The stock trades at 67 times trailing earnings (last year’s earnings) and 36 times forward earnings (the best estimate of next year’s earnings). It certainly looks pricey, but it has so much growth that it could be worth the asking price.
Faced with these mixed signals, investors might wish to look into AI stocks other than NVIDIA. The stock still has a chance to perform well, but the higher it goes, the more of its future growth is “priced in.” At the same time, there are dozens of AI stocks out there that aren’t pricey at all. In this article, I will explore two Canadian AI stocks you could buy as an alternative to NVIDIA.
Open Text Corp
Open Text Corp (TSX:OTEX) is a Canadian software company that develops content management systems, app development frameworks, and text analysis software. The company’s apps are sold as standalone offerings as well as in bundles. Open Text’s “Magellan” app is a pretty good example of the types of software this company makes. It allows users to quickly access and analyze data, creating (for example) tables and charts.
Open Text Corp is using AI in its business. The aforementioned “Magellan” product is one example of this: it uses AI to sift through piles of complex data and convert them into actionable data. Another example is Intelligent Capture, which reads documents and takes the actionable business insights out of them.
Open Text Corp is doing well with its AI-powered software offerings. In the most recent quarter, it delivered:
- $1.5 billion in revenues, up 71%.
- $1.1 billion in recurring revenues, up 58%.
- $0.14 in GAAP earnings per share (“GAAP” means “generally accepted accounting principles), down 85%.
- $0.85 in adjusted earnings per share, up 39.3%.
It was a pretty impressive showing. Although GAAP net income went down, it was mostly due to non-recurring factors. On the whole, it looks like OTEX’s business is booming.
Kinaxis
Kinaxis Inc (TSX:KXS) is a Canadian software company that uses AI to help businesses make key supply chain decisions. Its supply chain software – Rapid Response – is widely used by manufacturers to help them keep track of inventory. Using Kinaxis’ AI, companies can notice and track trends in inventory and raw inputs, so they always have the items they need on time, every time. Kinaxis is a true growth company, with revenue up 23.2% per year and free cash flow up 46% per year over the last five years. It’s fairly pricey, but not as pricey as NVDA. It’s worth a look.",https://www.fool.ca/2024/03/11/missed-out-on-nvidia-try-these-alternative-ai-stocks/

In one of the best illustrations of the buy-the-dip mentality so far this year, investors are flocking to a leveraged long-only ETF to generate outsized gains on the back of the recent weakness in NVIDIA shares and in anticipation of the GPU manufacturer's upcoming GTC Conference. This funding influx serves as an emblem of sorts to the uber-bullish sentiment that still persists around NVIDIA shares despite transitory weakness.
As we noted recently, NVIDIA performed a 10 percent intra-day round-trip on Friday amid heightened call option monetization and profit-taking activity, eventually losing around 84 percent of Uber's market cap. At the time of writing, the stock is still down around 10 percent relative to its all-time high of $974 per share.

Can we buy Nvidia shares on the ASX?
We can't directly buy Nvidia shares on the ASX. The business's primary listing is in the US on the NASDAQ.
However, there are several ways for Aussies to access the company. Of course, we can invest in Nvidia shares via a broker that allows international share trading.
There are a number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the ASX that own Nvidia shares as part of the portfolio.
For example, the iShares S&P 500 ETF (ASX: IVV) currently has a 5.1% weighting to the business.
But, for investors wanting an even bigger allocation, I have some other suggestions.
Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX: NDQ) currently has a 6.5% weighting to the technology company.
The BetaShares Global Sustainability Leaders ETF (ASX: ETHI), an ethically-based ETF, currently has a weighting of 10.4% to the AI stock.
The Global X Fang+ ETF (ASX: FANG) has an even bigger allocation – 16% – to Nvidia shares.
If I wanted to get as much exposure to Nvidia shares as possible, I'd go for the FANG ETF.

NVIDIA DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, uses artificial intelligence (AI) and dedicated Tensor cores found on NVIDIA RTX series GPUs to boost gaming performance without compromising visual fidelity. That said, the latest version, DLSS 3.5, in its full glory, is exclusive to the RTX 40-series GPUs.
Thankfully, there’s AMD with its FSR technology. It’s an open-source technology, and the modding community has devised a clever workaround to use AMD FSR on NVIDIA RTX GPUs. That means you get to enjoy frame generation on your existing RTX card, allowing you to experience smoother gameplay and potentially significant performance boosts in supported games. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the steps to use AMD FSR3 on your NVIDIA RTX GPUs. So, let’s get to it.
Why Consider Using AMD FSR3 for NVIDIA GPUs
If you’re on a previous generation of NVIDIA’s RTX GPUs, chances are that your GPU still handles most games very well. That said, you are still missing out on the extra boost that DLSS 3.5 would have provided. That’s where the AMD FSR3 mod comes in handy.
This mod allows you to experience frame generation technology without upgrading to the latest RTX 40 series. It translates to smoother gameplay and performance improvements in supported titles. While it’s not an official solution and might not work with every game, it’s a simple and free way to boost your gaming performance.
System Requirements
Before we walk you through the actual steps to use the AMD FSR3 mod, ensuring that your system is compatible is important. First and foremost, the mod only works on NVIDIA RTX 20-Series or 30-Series GPUs. Secondly, you can use it in titles that natively support DLSS 3 or FSR 3 frame generation. Finally, ensure you have the latest NVIDIA GPU drivers installed for your graphics card. You can download them from the official NVIDIA website linked below.
How to Install and Use AMD FSR3 on NVIDIA RTX GPUs
Now that you have your system ready, it’s time to install the AMD FSR3 mod and use it. Here’s how to go about it.
Step 1: First, enable Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling by heading to Windows Settings > System > Display > Graphics > Default graphics settings. Enable the toggle and restart your PC to apply the changes.
Step 2: Next, download the latest build of the dlssg-to-fsr3 mod from the link below. While there are different versions available, the standard version should work.
Click on the ‘Manual Download’ option as shown. Note that you must sign up at NexusMods to download the file. That said, it’s a free download, so you don’t have to pay anything.
Step 3: Once the mod’s ZIP file has been downloaded, extract it to a folder of your location. Inside the extracted folder, you’ll find several DLL files and a configuration file, as shown below.
Step 4: Now, in another Windows Explorer window, navigate to the installation location of the game you wish to install the mod in. For example, for Cyberpunk 2077, this is the directory containing Cyberpunk2077.exe.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\
Step 5: Now, go back to the folder where you extracted the mod’s files. From there, copy the ‘dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll’ and ‘nvngx.dll’ files and paste them to the game’s folder.
Step 6: Finally, double-click on the ‘DisableNvidiaSignatureChecks’ registry file inside the mod folder. This will fool your PC into thinking that your GPU is DLSS 3 compliant, even if not. Ensure that permissions are granted if requested to add values to your registry.
Step 7: And that’s it. The AMD FSR3 mod has been installed. You can now launch the game and head over to the graphics settings. There, the option to enable DLSS 3 should be available. Enable it, and you’re done.
How to Uninstall AMD FSR3 Mod
As good as the FSR3 Mod is, there are some issues with it. For starters, certain UI and HUD elements might not render properly. Secondly, some users have noticed increased input latency with certain titles. Finally, while the mod works great for single-player modes, if you plan on gaming online, disable the mod to avoid the risk of getting banned. Thankfully, the way to uninstall the AMD FSR3 mod is simple.
Step 1: Navigate to the game’s installation folder as before. Now, delete both ‘dlssg_to_fsr3_amd_is_better.dll’ and ‘nvngx.dll’ files.
Step 2: Next, open the mod’s extracted folder and double-click on the ‘RestoreNvidiaSignatureChecks’ file. This will restore your registry to the way it was.
Enjoy AMD FS3 on Your NVIDIA RTX GPUs
Using the AMD FSR 3 mod provides a unique opportunity for owners of Nvidia RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs to experience frame generation technology previously exclusive to the latest RTX 40-series cards. While it’s not without its limitations and potential risks, the mod brings enhanced performance and visual quality to a wider audience.
We hope that with our detailed guide, you successfully installed and used the AMD FS3 mod on your NVIDIA RTX GPU. So, enjoy the extra frames for the lost cost of zero bucks on your gaming rig.

Sam Benstead learns how one ii ISA millionaire made his fortune with bold bets on technology shares.
11th March 2024 09:46
by Sam Benstead from interactive investor
The journey to ISA millionaire status for John (not his real name) began early. Now in his 70s, he has strong childhood memories of his father being a “gambler” and into horse racing. He introduced investing to him when he was at school.
“I was bought two shares – Dunlop and Costain – then went on to study economics, and when I started work I began investing my savings in the stock market rather than in building society accounts.”
- Invest with ii: Top ISA Funds | Top Junior ISA Funds | Open a Stocks & Shares ISA
John used the tax-efficient Personal Equity Plan (PEP) and then an ISA to invest in the stock market in a tax-efficient way.
“I’ve always understood the deferred pay-off from investing and the benefits of shielding returns from dividend and capital gains tax. I’ve hardly ever withdrawn money from ISAs,” he said.
The investor worked in the economics and statistic department of a government industry and took voluntary redundancy on “good terms” aged 50 when it was nationalised in the 1980s.

- The simple maths that can make you an ISA millionaire
- ‘I made £80K on an AIM share’ – how an ISA millionaire’s portfolio evolved
His index-linked pension also began aged 50, so alongside some inherited money, he did not need to return to work and could focus on managing his investment portfolio.
An early investment in Scottish Mortgage was key to getting him over the £1 million mark in his ISA.
He put £3,000 into the global trust in 1990, when it was less focused on fast-growing companies. After the trust made James Anderson (who retired in 2022) lead manager in 2000, it pivoted to a more growth-focused investment approach and made early bets on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).
At its peak in late 2021, Scottish Mortgage shares traded at about £15. They cost under 50p when John first invested, meaning that his £3,000 stake had grown to nearly £100,000 three years ago, before dropping substantially as interest rates took the shine off growth stocks.
“I top-sliced it to keep it around £100,000, but the entire stake is worth about £50,000 now. It’s been an amazing return for me, but with lots of swings and roundabouts on the way,” he said.
Another big winner has been computer chip firm Nvidia, whose processors are used to run artificial intelligence software, as well as computer games and bitcoin mining operations.
John invested $5,000 (£3,900) five years ago and as of early February 2024 his stake was worth more than $90,000 (£70,200) and he told me that he had not sold any of it yet. Since we spoke, the chip company’s shares have risen by another third, making it a $2 trillion company.
He has also backed other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven: Apple, Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft, as well as buying shares in Polar Capital Technology, an investment trust that has large stakes in the biggest tech names.
“Owning lots of US shares has made a big difference to returns,” John said.
Long-term UK investments include GSK, Rio Tinto and AstraZeneca.
But not all stocks have been winners. John was caught up in the 2020 craze for vaccine stocks. He paid $30 a share for Novavax. Shares rose to $320, with John taking profits at $280 to cash in his original stake, but the company is now worth just $6 a share. Other biotech shares he invested in have gone to zero.
“Some fly, some go to zero, especially in biotech sector,” he said.

John has become more risk-averse as he has got older. Now, about 70% of his portfolio is in collectives, including investment trusts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). He says that most of his individual shares are now large, established companies.
He inherited some money in 2019, which he is gradually moving into his ISA, and most of it is going into ETFs and trusts.
Recent purchases include Alliance Trust, Fidelity Asia, Fidelity European and Law Debenture.
Long-term positions include BlackRock World Mining trust. “It yields well but has not performed well. This has been a long-term position, so the dividend is substantial now,” he said.
ETFs he owns include Vanguard trackers VUKE (FTSE 100), VHYL (All World High Dividend) and VFEM (Emerging Markets).
However, he says that there is too much overlap in his portfolio, particularly of large US technology companies which dominate stock market indices.
“I’ve got 30 to 40 positions overall, and lots of the ETFs overlap due to US tech stock dominance. The portfolio could need pruning and reorganising,” he said.
The secrets to success
John estimates that his annualised return over his investment life has been 8%: “That’s high compared to a deposit account at the bank,” he says. However, it’s about what global equities have delivered annually over 40 years.
The ISA millionaire’s philosophy is to attempt to maintain a balanced portfolio.
“If something is going down, then something else is going up. It is good to balance things out and diversify and not put all [your] eggs in one basket. Don’t try and time the market and go to cash.
“My portfolio is well sheltered now due to owning funds, and the dividends are steady as well,” John said.
The investor has no plans for the large pot due to his pension income.

“I’m still active but there could be some health expenditure or significant repairs on the house. I’ve made my will already and left [money] to people and educational establishments.”
He says that he is a natural saver and is not likely to cash out much of the portfolio unless he has to.
“My generation has had it good with jobs, inheritance, [and] getting on the property ladder. It’s a nice position to be in,” he notes.
His advice to other investors is to start as soon as possible and invest in funds, where a fund manager can monitor the portfolio.
“Invest your spare cash in the stock market as the state pension is not going to be much use. You need to take control yourself.”

With Counter-Strike 2 continuing to grow, many players are looking for a competitive edge on the server as they rise through the ranks. Right now, though, it’s safe to say the game isn’t quite as optimized as CS:GO was. That’s why we’ve put together this guide to the best CS2 NVIDIA settings, so you can ensure you’re playing at the maximum FPS possible.
While the best CS2 settings could change as the game becomes more optimized in the future, for now, this is all you need.
Best CS2 Settings
First things first, you should start in-game. Press the cog in the top left corner of your Counter-Strike 2 released Client, and head to the “Video” tab. From there, go to “Advanced Video” and select the following settings. If you’re a CS2 NVIDIA user, these will provide the best results for FPS and visibility in-game:
- Boost Player Contrast: Enabled
- Wait for Vertical Sync: Disabled
- Multisampling Anti-Aliasing Mode: CMAA2
- Global Shadow Quality: High
- Model / Texture Detail: Medium
- Texture Filtering Mode: Bilinear
- Shader Detail: Low
- Particle Detail: Low
- Ambient Occlusion: Disabled
- High Dynamic Range: Quality
- FidelityFX Super Resolution: Disabled (Highest Quality)
- NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency: Enabled
By selecting the best CS2 settings inside the game, you’re setting yourself up for success when jumping into the Counter-Strike 2 release.
CS2 NVIDIA Control Panel Settings
However, it’s not the only way CS2 NVIDIA users can improve their performance. The NVIDIA Control Panel is a useful tool you can use to adjust things even further. You can do this by opening NVIDIA Control Panel, pressing “Manage 3D settings,” and going to “Program Settings”. From there, hit the drop-down menu and find your CS2.exe (you may have to manually search for this). After this, select the following settings:
- Image Scaling: Use global setting
- Anisotropic Filtering: Application-controlled
- Antialiasing – FXAA: Off
- Antialiasing – Gamma Correction: Off
- Antialiasing – Mode: Application-controlled
- Antialiasing – Transparency: Off
- Background Application Max Frame Rate: Off

- Incoming New York Community Bank CEO Joseph Otting will receive an annual base salary of $1.25 million, the bank disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Friday.
- Otting will also be eligible for an annual cash bonus with a target value of $2.25 million, but that amount could balloon to $4.5 million, according to the filing.
- Alessandro DiNello, the bank’s executive chair, will receive a base salary of $500,000 per month — though that will be for less than two months. DiNello was given that title Feb. 6 and will return to his previous role as non-executive chairman April 1, when Otting becomes CEO. DiNello will receive $450,000 per year as non-executive chair, NYCB disclosed Friday.
Dive Insight:
As often happens in the banking sphere, Otting and DiNello both stand to make considerably more through stock options than with salary and bonus.
Otting is receiving a one-time, 10-year stock option award covering 15 million shares at $2 per share, NYCB said Friday. The options will vest over three years in equal quarterly installments, unless there’s a change in control of the bank. In that case, they’d vest immediately, the bank said.
DiNello, meanwhile, is receiving a one-time stock option grant of 4 million shares at $3.46 per share, NYCB said. He’ll also get a one-time restricted stock award covering 1,690,000 shares, which — on the settlement date — will turn into the value of 1,690,000 shares at the time, or the number of shares that equals $5,840,000, whichever is less.
Additionally, DiNello will serve as a consultant to the bank from April 1 through the remainder of the year, with base compensation of $450,000 per year and eligibility for an annual bonus.
Half of DiNello’s executive chairman compensation will be paid in cash, with the other half coming in restricted stock units, which will vest in a year.
Otting, who led the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency during the Trump administration, was named NYCB’s next CEO as part of a deal in which investors led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s firm, Liberty Strategic Capital, infused the struggling lender with $1.05 billion.
NYCB’s recent woes began Jan. 31, when the bank announced a surprise $252 million fourth-quarter loss related to commercial real estate exposure. The bank’s stock price lost 84% of its value between then and the Mnuchin rescue Wednesday. Since the deal was announced, value per share has doubled. NYCB named DiNello executive chair Feb. 6, then CEO roughly three weeks later, when his predecessor, Thomas Cangemi, resigned.
Cangemi received $6.28 million in compensation in 2022, according to Reuters.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/nycb-otting-dinello-salary-bonus-stock-option-vest-mnuchin-cangemi/709831/

New York Community Bancorp (NYCB) shares rose over 4% in intraday trading Tuesday after the bank announced the completion of a $1 billion equity investment by a group of firms and its intention to implement a one-for-three reverse stock split. As part of the deal, former Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting was named the lender’s new chief executive. He also joined the bank’s board of directors, the size of which was reduced to 10 members, alongside former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and investors Milton Berlinksi and Allen Puwalski. The company also said Monday that it was proposing a one-for-three reverse stock split to boost its share price, which has plummeted this year amid concerns about NYCB's exposure to troubled commercial real estate loans. Shares had tumbled following the company’s decision at the end of January to slash its dividend after reporting a surprise quarterly loss, and came under further pressure late last month when the bank replaced its longtime CEO after identifying “material weaknesses” in internal controls. NYCB shares were up 4.2% at $3.38 as of 3:10 p.m. ET Tuesday. Still, the stock has lost about 67% of its value since the start of 2024.

Subscribe to keep up with what I’m writing, thinking and reading every week.
It’s been a wild few weeks in the banking world. And it all has something to do with that landmark, though at times frustrating, Community Reinvestment Act of 1977.
Let’s start with what feels like the most frustrating. Previously, as Comptroller of the Currency, Joseph Otting was in charge of one of the nation’s main bank regulatory agencies. The obscure Office of the Comptroller of the Currency charters and supervises banks, which includes being one of three federal bank regulator agencies that share responsibility for enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act.
The Community Reinvestment Act says banks have “a continuing and affirmative obligation” to meet the credit needs of the communities where they do business, consistent with “safe and sound operation of such institutions.” It gives regulators the authority, for example, to deny bank applications to open or close branches, or to acquire or merge with another bank, if regulators believe the bank is not meeting those obligations.
From nearly day one of the previous Trump administration, as I’ve covered previously, Otting made it a personal mission to gut the rules and regulations under the Community Reinvestment Act. He was so brazen about it that even the banking industry wasn’t entirely sure it wanted to go along with him. He very nearly did gut those rules, but after coming into office, the Biden Administration rescinded his planned changes.
Well, last week, Otting made another splash in the banking world being named as the new CEO of New York Community Bank, as part of a plan to rescue that bank from imminent failure with an infusion of a billion dollars in private equity money.
Despite its name, New York Community Bank is no longer technically a community bank, as it operates in too many different states and metropolitan areas. The bank is struggling mostly because it made a large number of loans that depended on landlords jacking up rents after flipping rent-stabilized housing into market-rate housing. Tenant-led New York State housing reforms in 2019 essentially put a stop to that model, and now the chickens have come home to roost.
The billion-dollar infusion from private equity comes with an additional twist. The investment was led by Steven Mnuchin, former Treasury Secretary under the Trump administration, who now becomes board chair at New York Community Bank.
It keeps going. After the Biden administration rescinded Otting’s attempt at gutting Community Reinvestment Act regulations, it re-booted the process of overhauling those regulations. It’s been two decades since those regulations were last given a major overhaul, a time that has seen many changes in the banking industry — from the rise of online and mobile banking to the unprecedented banking industry consolidation over these past few decades.
The newly updated Community Reinvestment Act rules attempt to address these changes by creating what it calls “retail lending assessment areas,” which are effectively a way to evaluate banks’ obligations under the law in places where they don’t have physical branches but are making loans anyway. (Check out our webinar breaking down the recent overhaul to the CRA.)
Earlier this month, in a widely expected move, industry lobbyists led by the American Bankers Association and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a lawsuit against the new regulations (in the infamously Republican-friendly Northern District of Texas). The lawsuit specifically calls out the “retail lending assessment areas” as overstepping the authority granted under the law.
In response, the Opportunity Finance Network, a trade association of community development lenders, issued a statement opposing the lawsuit and specifically calling out the retail lending assessment areas as helping to “drive bank reinvestment in the communities in which they operate, regardless of their physical presence.” More to come on that over the next few months, potentially years. Even if the lawsuit fails, the new Community Reinvestment Act rules aren’t scheduled to come into effect until 2026.
The Community Reinvestment Act is also tied up in other big news that’s been brewing: the announced (but not yet consummated) merger of consumer credit banking giants Capital One and Discover.
Capital One is already much larger than Discover, but Discover has something Capital One wants: its own payment processing network. Capital One wants to challenge the dominance of Visa and MasterCard, which are not credit card companies or banks but payment processing companies that essentially have a duopoly on payment processing. American Express is another bank that owns its own payment processing network, but it’s focused on high-end consumers and businesses, while Discover was created by Sears in 1986 as a broader consumer alternative to Visa and MasterCard.
Over at Fast Company, financial journalist James Surowiecki writes that the Capital One-Discover merger could be a boon for consumers and business owners, who could see lower swipe fees with the addition of a larger competitor to Visa and MasterCard. But bank watchdogs, consumer rights, and civil rights groups remain unconvinced, with 18 signatories so far to a letter detailing numerous concerns that include what they view as violations of the Community Reinvestment Act as well as potential violations of federal anti-trust laws.
But let’s wrap up on some hopeful notes.
The Community Reinvestment Act was passed at a time when banks made the vast majority of loans. It was also passed as a race-neutral law because that was the only politically feasible way to get it passed at the time. Rather than waiting for the federal law to change, some states have been taking things into their own hands.
Today for Next City, racial and economic justice advocate Paulina Gonzalez-Brito has penned an op-ed calling for California to pass a state-level Community Reinvestment Act that would expand coverage to include credit unions and independent mortgage companies (like Rocket Mortgage or Guaranteed Rate), which account for much more of the lending market today than they used to. In so doing, California would join Massachusetts and Illinois in expanding their state-level community reinvestment laws to credit unions and mortgage companies (see our previous coverage of that here). New York also expanded its state-based community reinvestment act to mortgage companies in 2021.
Gonzalez-Brito also wants California to take race into account when evaluating institutions for compliance with the proposed state-based community reinvestment act. Illinois advocates are still fighting to make their state the first to do that under its expanded state-based community reinvestment laws passed in 2021.
Which brings us to one final piece: It was a big weekend for Arlo Washington, the Black barber-turned-credit union founder. Even with the existing Community Reinvestment Act’s shortcomings, as Washington often says the law has helped fuel his work by giving him leverage to garner support from larger financial institutions for the work he’s doing building a much smaller financial institution. As I covered last year, Washington made history by obtaining the first new credit union charter in Arkansas since 1996.
Obtaining a credit union charter was just the latest step in Washington’s longer story of economic justice and empowerment for his community in Little Rock, now immortalized on screen in “The Barber of Little Rock.” The film was nominated this year for an Oscar in the category of Best Documentary Short. Although it didn’t win, Washington and his wife were interviewed on the red carpet on their way into the Oscars on Sunday evening.

Concerns have shifted to exposure to commercial real estate credit. The IMF estimates that vulnerable lenders have $5.5 trillion in assets, 23% of the total
When he was Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin and his wife attended the issuance of the first banknotes that bore his signature, triggering many jokes and memes about them looking like movie villains. This week, Mnuchin has become the hero, at least temporarily, after he came to the rescue of New York Community Bancorp (NYCB), which is fighting for its survival following a flood of bad news. NYCB illustrates the extent to which U.S. regional banks remain under pressure a year after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). It is also the best example of how concerns have shifted from interest rate risk and liquidity to commercial real estate credit exposure.
A report released this past week by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) notes that the group of weak U.S. banks represents an estimated total of $5.5 trillion in assets, almost 23% of total banking assets. “Underlying concerns persist, with fears that the failure of one institution could precipitate a broader loss of confidence in the sector,” says the report.
The latent losses due to the rise in rates (which have devalued the banks' bond portfolio) are combined with the credit risk of some entities, particularly their exposure to commercial real estate credit (CRE). Small and regional banks are highly exposed, with about two-thirds of the $3 trillion of risk in that sector of the U.S. banking system, according to the IMF.
“The high concentration of CRE exposures represents a serious risk to small and large banks amid economic uncertainty and higher interest rates, potentially declining property values, and asset quality deterioration,” the report states.
For now, the NYCB crisis appears to be contained, not only because the entity has found a lifeline, but because the contagion effect has been smaller. However, given the interconnectedness of the financial system, even the bankruptcy of a non-systemic entity can threaten overall financial stability. That much was demonstrated by the fall of SVB, the second-largest bank failure in the history of the United States, which was followed days later by Signature Bank (the third) and a few weeks after that by First Republic Bank. All of them were bailed out by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which is now sending the bill to the banks.
The banking crisis of a year ago can be explained as a butterfly effect of the pandemic. With the Covid crisis, the federal government gave out generous aid and deposits skyrocketed. Some banks invested these resources in long-term bonds. The liquidity fueled inflation and that led the Federal Reserve to raise rates. With the rate increases, capital losses appeared in bond portfolios, while deposits were reduced (particularly in venture capital and new technology companies, both of which were SVB clients). The clamp squeezed on both sides: liabilities (deposits) and assets (bonds).
A disastrous recommendation
The fall of Silicon Valley Bank, however, was also due to other factors. The SVB ship may have had a leak, but perhaps could have reached port in time for repairs if not for a storm of factors. Everything that could go wrong went wrong. The former CEO of SVB, Gregory Becker, explained in the Senate that his bank, like many others, had losses in its debt portfolio, but that he allowed himself to be advised by Goldman Sachs to sell it and increase capital in what ended up being a disastrous recommendation.
“On the advice of Goldman Sachs, we decided to sell our available-for-sale portfolio in order to realize those losses and explain to the market why we were raising capital, given that SVB’s finances were otherwise healthy. SVB had sufficient liquidity and was adequately capitalized on March 8 [the day it launched that operation on the advice of Goldman Sachs], as its Federal Reserve supervisory teams had previously acknowledged,” Becker said.
On March 8, the day the operation was announced, Silvergate Bank, focused almost 100% on cryptocurrencies, announced its voluntary liquidation. Although SVB only had about 3% of its customer deposits in cryptocurrency, it had been compared to Silvergate in the Financial Times two weeks earlier. On March 9, SVB collapsed on the stock market, unleashing panic. “The fall of Silvergate and the link to SVB caused rumors and misconceptions to spread rapidly across the internet, leading to the start of what would become an unprecedented deposit drain. [...] $42 billion in SVB deposits were withdrawn in 10 hours, or approximately $1 million every second,” Becker explained.
After almost 40 years of existence, Silicon Valley Bank was destroyed in about 40 hours. While trying to obtain liquidity, on the morning of March 10, the FDIC intervened. That day, another $100 billion in withdrawals was requested, bringing the sum to $142 billion, 80% of total deposits, in just two days. The previous largest bank run in U.S. history, by Washington Mutual in 2008, had been $19 billion in 16 days. Deposit insurance was created to prevent banking panics, but in the case of SVB, the vast majority were unguaranteed deposits from investment, venture capital and technology firms, which led the stampede.
“This experience has changed everyone’s perception of the possible speed of bank runs. What occurred in two or three weeks or, in some cases, many months in previous episodes may, in the modern era, now occur in hours,” said Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr last December. “The March 2023 turmoil potentially showed [how] the growing influence of technological advances, such as mobile banking and the rapid spread of information through electronic communications, could have contributed to the speed of the deposit run,” according to the IMF report.
Supervisory failures
SVB was “a textbook case of mismanagement of interest rate and liquidity risk‚” in Barr’s words. Successive autopsies revealed that it was also a textbook case of poor supervision. “The SVB managers fell asleep at the wheel, but so did the regulators,” said Gary Cohn, vice president of IBM who was then president of Goldman Sachs, at an event organized by the Brookings Institution this week in Washington. Warning signs arose again and again, but they were not stopped in time. “I was amazed at what Silicon Valley Bank and First Republic Bank were able to do,” said William Demchak, the head of PNC Financial, the eighth-largest bank in the United States, at the same event. “Ironically, the overdue actions it finally took to strengthen its balance sheet sparked the uninsured depositor run that led to the bank’s failure,” Barr explained on the Senate floor. Citibank analysts called the bank’s downfall “self-inflicted.”
Following SVB, Signature Bank (SB) and First Republic Bank collapsed. All three had in common a high concentration of uninsured deposits, significant unrealized losses and exposure to residential real estate credit before bankruptcy. After the fall of SVB and SB, the Federal Reserve tried to calm the waters in two ways: by guaranteeing the uninsured deposits of these entities (for this it had to allege systemic risk) and opening a special liquidity window in which banks have asked for as much as $165 billion with debt securities as collateral. The Fed decided to close it after verifying that banks were using it for arbitrage and making profits.
Deposit runs are something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. No bank has the liquidity to return the money if all clients ask for it at the same time. That is why bank runs are so dangerous. Following last year’s experiences, the supervisor is now monitoring liquidity risk more closely. However, when it comes to regulation, some voices within the Federal Reserve warn of the risk of overreacting. Michelle Bowman, a Fed advisor, on Friday said she has “significant concerns” about possible regulatory reforms involving liquidity requirements. All banks must manage their liquidity, but must have flexibility based on a number of factors, such as risk, business model, size, complexity, funding needs, vulnerability to deposit withdrawals and other considerations, she said. “Liquidity requirements, if not appropriately designed and calibrated, could trap resources that would otherwise be put to better use, like lending to bank customers,” said Bowman.
Another consequence of the crisis was an increase in banking concentration, in two ways. On the one hand, savers sought refuge in the largest entities. On the other hand, large lenders purchased the assets and liabilities of the fallen banks. J.P. Morgan, which took over First Republic Bank, was the biggest beneficiary in both ways.
The earthquake had aftershocks in Europe with the fall of Credit Suisse, but it did not trigger a full-blown financial crisis, as the authorities acted to prevent transmission. That is the positive reading. The negative is that “vulnerabilities persist in the U.S. banking sector,” as the IMF maintains.
“Last year’s bank stress underscores the importance of not becoming complacent,” Loretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said last week at a keynote address at Columbia University in New York. “We need to look holistically at the regulations, our methods of supervision, and our lender of last resort function to address the vulnerabilities that were revealed,” she added.
NYCB, now on the ropes, was the lender that took over most of the liabilities of Signature Bank, one of the banks that collapsed a year ago. And the pressure is also intensifying against a small, struggling entity with an unfortunate name: Republic First Bancorp, which only serves as a reminder of the crisis of a year ago.

The new restaurant, which opened Tuesday at 31 Hugh J. Grant Circle, is the 15th Chipotle to open in the Bronx but is the first in the borough to be all electric-powered—swapping out gas-powered systems in favor of more efficient appliances, exhaust hoods and water heaters.
The opening of the Parkchester location is part of the company’s nationwide expansion. Chipotle, which has approximately 3,400 restaurants across the U.S., plans to open about 300 new locations countrywide in 2024, according to a spokesperson. And according to information from the company, at least 100 of the new stores will use electric appliances plus at least some elements of the all-electric design. Certain locations will even feature solar panels and charging stations for electric vehicles.
The company says it only makes sense for its physical design to match its ethos of “working with — not against — nature,” said Chief Marketing Officer Chris Brandt in a 2023 statement announcing the design rollout.
The company has set a goal to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. To accomplish this, Chipotle plans to continue the rollout of its “responsible restaurant design” while using more locally sourced produce, developing more meatless options and using standardized energy management systems in all locations, among other strategies.
“With our aggressive development goal in North America, we hold ourselves accountable to reduce the environmental impact of our restaurants,” said Laurie Schalow, Chief Corporate Affairs Officer.
The new Parkchester location is open daily from 10:45 a.m. to 10 p.m.

It’s only gotten bigger since then.
Now sporting a $74 billion market cap (NYSE: CMG), after seeing its share price increase nearly 75% over the past 12 months, the fast-casual restaurant chain has come a long way since 2018 when it was worth around $7 billion, and Brian Niccol was hired as chief executive.
The question now is whether Chipotle, which opened a record number of restaurants last year, can maintain its goal of doubling its restaurant count in a few years.
Wall Street thinks so.
“The company has a visible path to comfortably exceeding its stated long-term target of 7,000+ locations,” Baird analyst David Tarantino wrote in a note to investors last month.
Baird’s research suggests that “brand saturation has not yet been reached and signaling that our 8,250+ figure for North America eventually may prove conservative,” he added.
The chain currently counts over 3,400 locations.
Passing $10B
Chipotle reported revenue grew 14% to $9.9 billion in 2023; analysts are expecting another 14% growth this year to $11.2 billion and 13% more growth in 2025 to $12.7 billion.
Despite headwinds such as development delays, wage inflation and higher costs for ingredients, Chipotle’s guidance and expectations remain positive.
Niccol last month admitted the 7,000+ restaurant goal might be on the conservative side.
“At one point, we were talking about having 3,000 [Chipotles] and then we said 4,000 and we said 5,000,” Niccol told analysts on a conference call last month. “Here we are at 7,000.
I hope it does prove to be conservative. I think the brand’s got a lot of upsides in it.”
Not only is Chipotle the most valuable public company in Orange County, but it is also the third most valuable publicly traded restaurant chain in America, only trailing McDonald’s Corp.’s $210 billion (NYSE: MCD) and Starbucks Corp.’s $103 billion (Nasdaq: SBUX).
Chipotle’s market cap is almost twice that of Yum Brands Inc. (NYSE: YUM) where Niccol oversaw its Irvine-based Taco Bell unit; his LinkedIn profile said he coined the chain’s famous “Live Más” slogan.
Speed and Tech
Almost a decade ago, Chipotle amassed negative publicity after a slew of food poisoning cases that resulted in 1,100 people falling sick. That caused sales to drop 13% to $3.9 billion in 2016.
The company paid a $25 million fine, the largest ever in a food safety case.
Then-CEO Steve Ells, who founded the company in 1993, hired Niccol in 2018.
One of Niccol’s first acts was to move Chipotle’s headquarters from Denver to Newport Beach.
“We really wanted to be where the food culture that we wanted to create exists, and then also wanted to have access to the technology talent that we knew we would need to really transform the business,” Niccol told the Business Journal in early 2020, when he was named Businessperson of the Year. The company’s valuation at the time: $24 billion.
In 2019, he introduced a concept that combined technology and speed called Chipotlane, which caters to online customers ordering meals to go. It reported 811 Chipotlanes by the end of last year.
Investors have previously cited digital sales, which now represent 37% of its sales, as a key reason for the stock’s performance.
Also in 2019, Chipotle started a rewards program that awards discounts via a points system and allows easier transactions by saving customers’ prior orders. It now has almost 40 million members.
Niccol described the rewards program as a “powerful tool” that helps upsell products like Mexican Coca-Cola, salsa and guacamole.
“Whether you’re a light, medium, or heavy user, when you’re in the rewards program, you come more frequently and you spend more,” he said.
Chipotle has invested in automation and robotics to improve prep work and in-house operations.
In 2022, it unveiled “Chippy,” a robotic machine to cook and season the restaurant’s tortilla chips. This spring, it plans to test the “Autocado,” which slices and smashes avocados for its guacamole, in one of its restaurants.
“That’s why you continue to see us look at all these robotic ideas to make prep even more efficient,” Niccol told analysts. The company’s Cultivate Center, where it tests out much of its new foods and processes, is in Irvine.
$4M AUV Goal
Chipotle last year opened 271 new restaurants and now has a total of 3,437 locations. The company last year also signed its first international partnership with franchise operator Alshaya Group to drive expansion in Kuwait and Dubai.
Analysts are bullish.
Chipotle “is driving industry leading traffic primarily via improved throughput as demand remains strong across customer income levels, giving us confidence that traffic will continue to grow with strong execution, irrespective of the macro environment,” Truist Securities analyst Jake Barlett told investors in a report.
In the fourth quarter, Chipotle’s average unit volume (AUV) reached $3 million for the first time. Niccol is aiming to reach $4 million in annual sales per restaurant.
“Our strong economic model gives us a high degree of confidence that our ambitious growth objectives are achievable, if not beatable,” Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung told analysts.
Chipotle will be announcing its first-quarter results on April 24.
Benefits for Gen Z Employees
California in April is requiring restaurants to pay a minimum wage of $20 an hour.
Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., which has 15% of its 3,400-plus restaurants in California, is preparing.
“We anticipate wage inflation will tick up to the mid-single-digit range as California wages go up around 20% in April this year,” Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung told analysts on a February conference call.
Chief Executive Brian Niccol told analysts that he’s witnessing the best stability of employees since he took over in 2018. The company has 115,000 employees.
In 2023, Chipotle promoted more than 24,000 people, with over 90% of all current restaurant management roles internally promoted, according to Niccol.
The company is introducing a new employee assistance program as it looks to hire additional employees for the chain’s busy season between March and May.
Newer benefits such as financial wellness and mental well-being programs have been added to cater to the younger employees coming onboard. More than 73% of Chipotle’s restaurant employees are reported to be Generation Z, which is generally considered those born between 1997 and 2012.
The Chipotle team is also preparing for an increase in other expenses along with the investments in employee benefits.
A Truist Securities analyst is projecting its restaurant costs will rise 12% to 14% in the coming two years, in line with the expected revenue growth.
“We expect our underlying [general and administrative] to be around $127 million in Q1 and step up each quarter as we make investments in people and technology to support our ongoing growth,” Hartung said.",https://www.ocbj.com/food/chipotles-rise-74b-valuation-10b-in-sales/

New FS/TEC Technology Guide helps restaurants navigate complex tech landscape

Chicken al Pastor quickly accounted for one in five transactions at Chipotle restaurants last year after it was first introduced.
Chipotle is bringing back its Chicken al Pastor offering today for a limited time across North America and Europe. The item was first introduced in March 2023 and quickly became one of the chain’s most successful product launches ever, accounting for about 20% of transactions.
Chicken al Pastor includes chicken, marinade made of morita peppers and ground achiote, a splash of pineapple and finished with lime and cilantro. During Chipotle’s most recent earnings call last month, CEO Brian Niccol said the item surpassed expectations and drove incremental traffic. In July, shortly after its initial launch, he said the then-new protein is “boosting transactions with a strong repeat and is attracting new customers.”
“It also delivered the highest positive social sentiment of any new menu introduction, and importantly, was simple for our teams to execute,” he added.
According to the company, Chicken al Pastor has received three times more requests for its return on social media than any other limited time offering. As a nod to fans’ affinity, the company is also making the most ordered Chicken al Pastor bowl from 2023 available on the app and online in the U.S. and Canada. The bowl includes white rice, black beans, tomato salsa, roasted chili corn salsa, cheese, and guacamole.
“About one in five transactions included Chicken al Pastor when it was featured on our menu last year,” chief brand officer Chris Brandt said in a statement. “Given the performance and the fans wanting its return so enthusiastically, we are thrilled to make this the fastest item to ever come back to Chipotle.”
To mark the item’s return, Chipotle is offering a $0 delivery fee from March 14 through March 24 on all Chicken al Pastor orders placed via the Chipotle app and online in the U.S. and Canada.

Chicken al Pastor Returns to Chipotle
March 12, 2024
Chipotle has brought back a wildly popular item, Chicken al Pastor, to its menu. The protein features bold flavors like adobo, morita peppers, and ground achiote with a splash of pineapple, fresh lime, and cilantro to brighten the taste.
Chicken al Pastor debuted in March 2023 “as Chipotle’s first global menu innovation” and quickly became a fan favorite. A company press statement revealed just how the craveable menu item is prepared.
The fan-favorite dish is made with fresh chicken covered in a rich marinade of seared morita peppers and ground achiote. This heat is balanced with the sweetness of pineapple, the acidity of fresh lime, and the bite of cilantro.
Chipotle claims fans have petitioned for Chicken al Pastor’s return since it left menus in August 2023. “About one in five transactions included Chicken al Pastor when it was featured on our menu last year,” said Chris Brandt, chief brand officer of Chipotle. “Given the performance and the fans wanting its return so enthusiastically, we are thrilled to make this the fastest item to ever come back to Chipotle.”
Along with the return of Chicken al Pastor is the complete recipe for the most popular burrito bowl featuring the protein. It includes white rice, black beans, fresh tomato salsa, roasted chili-corn salsa, cheese, and guacamole. The “Most Ordered Chicken al Pastor Bowl” is available for convenient one-tap digital ordering in the Chipotle app, Chipotle.com, and stores.
As of December 2023, Chipotle had over 3,400 restaurants in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. It is the only restaurant company of its size that owns and operates all its restaurants in North America and Europe.
Chicken al Pastor returns on March 12, 2024, for a limited time. Chipotle celebrates the menu item’s return with a $0 delivery fee offer on all Chicken al Pastor orders placed through the Chipotle app, Chipotle.com, and Chipotle.ca from March 14 through March 24 in the U.S. and Canada.

Six hybrid chain restaurants we wish existed
You've heard of chicken and waffles, but how about wings and pancakes?
Believe it or not, the latter is now a reality. An IHOP/Applebee's hybrid restaurant officially opened its doors in January.
The only problem with the concept? It's in Mexico. So, if you want to eat a double blueberry shortstack with a side of four cheese penne — you'll have to fly 137 miles east of Guadalajara.
Now, since we're all probably never going to do that, we got to thinking: what are some other compound restaurants we'll probably never see? Because, as far as we're concerned, this one only exists in our dreams.
Here's what we came up with.
(And, PS: Even hypothetically, all of them are better than IHOP and Applebee's).
Pizza Hut and Charley's Cheesesteaks
Pizza Hut is one of our favorite chain restaurants of all time, namely due to its stuffed crust. Charley's, on the other hand, isn't as great as the pizza giant, but it does make some pretty killer sandwiches.
So, if the two went in on a hybrid location? We'd get cheesesteak-stuffed crust pizza.
Imagine a warm, ring of crust filled with chopped ribeye, grilled onions and melted American cheese around a savory pie (topped with even more cheesesteak), and you have a basic idea of what we're talking about.
Auntie Anne's and Subway
For a cheap, quick meal option, Subway is pretty hard to beat. Sure, the turkey is dry and the chipotle mayo, light mayo and regular mayo are pretty much the same thing, but, for under $10? There's not much we'd change about their loaded sandwiches.
Except, of course, putting them on warm, fresh pretzel bread made by Auntie Anne's.
Chick-fil-A and Chipotle
Crispy chicken burritos.
Enough said.
Crumbl Cookies and Cold Stone
Cookie sundaes, cookie dough-infused ice cream flavors (that aren't just chocolate chip) and the biggest chipwiches you've ever seen.
All that and more at Crumbl Stone.
Playa Bowls and Chop't
Have you ever arrived at Playa Bowls only to wish they had literally anything savory on the menu? Because, sometimes, we need actual, legitimate food to wash down our bananas and honey.
Enter Chop't.
If our favorite artisanal salad co. opened shop in the Gen Z paradise, diners would have their choice of fruit or veggie bowl — or throwing granola on top of their cobb in an irresistible sweet-salty mash-up.
Taco Bell and Panda Express
Pretty sure this is already a thing in an airport in Texas.
Locally, we call it the international aisle of ShopRite.

If you’ve been looking to change up your usual Chipotle order, then you’re in luck. The fast-casual restaurant chain just brought back its fan-favorite Chicken al Pastor after receiving numerous requests from customers.
The protein first launched in March 2023 as a limited-time offering. The returning item features grilled chicken marinated in seared morita peppers, ground achiote, pineapple, fresh lime, and hand-chopped cilantro. It was pulled from menus in August 2023.
This chicken option will be available at restaurants in the U.S., Canada, and Europe for a limited time, though Chipotle hasn’t shared how long it will be offered.
When it first launched in 2023, the Chicken al Pastor proved to be a success, according to the chain.
“About one in five transactions included Chicken al Pastor when it was featured on our menu last year,” Chris Brandt, Chipotle’s chief brand officer, said in a press release. “Given the performance and the fans wanting its return so enthusiastically, we are thrilled to make this the fastest item to ever come back to Chipotle.”
Additionally, the chain noted that there have been three times more social media requests for the return of Chicken al Pastor than any other limited-time offering. Among the requests for the menu item, one fan said they’d name their first-born son “Al pastor” to see the chicken option return. Another said they’d tattoo the item on their forehead.
For customers who want some order inspiration, the chain is also offering its most-ordered Chicken al Pastor burrito bowl from 2023. This includes white rice, black beans, fresh tomato salsa, roasted chili-corn salsa, cheese, and guacamole. Chipotle fans can order this online or in the Chipotle app.
“The rich flavor of our Chicken al Pastor shines in the fan-favorite bowl. Each ingredient layers for the perfectly balanced bite with the right level of sweetness, acidity, and heat,” Nevielle Panthaky, vice president of culinary at Chipotle, said in a press release. “It is simple, flavorful, unbelievably delicious, and has everything you crave.”
To celebrate the return of this menu item, Chipotle is offering a $0 delivery fee on all Chicken al Pastor orders placed on the Chipotle app or website from March 14 through March 24 in the U.S. and Canada.",https://www.eatthis.com/chipotle-chicken-al-pastor-returns-march-2024/

Fans of Chipotle's discontinued chicken al pastor just received some good news. It's back! Starting March 12, 2024, chicken al pastor will be available at Chipotle locations in the U.S., Canada, U.K., France, and Germany. Chicken al pastor hit menus in March 2023 and soared in popularity. In a press release announcing the return of the fan-favorite menu item, Chipotle stated that chicken al pastor was ordered every one out of five transactions during its run.
When chicken al pastor disappeared from menus in August, just a few short months after its introduction, fans were devastated, with many pleading with the company on social media to bring it back. Chipotle has had plenty of menu items flop, but the chicken al pastor was definitely not one of them. One fan said on Instagram they'd name their first-born son ""Al Pastor"" to get the dish back on menus, and an X, formerly known as Twitter, user said they'd get it tattooed on their forehead. We can only hope they don't follow through! While the comeback is good news for al pastor lovers, it isn't clear from the press release how long it will be available.
The deets on the chicken al pastor
Spicier and zestier, Chipotle's al pastor is a more firey option that stands out from the smokey adobo seasoned chicken on the menu. Al pastor is marinated with morita peppers, ground achiote, and a bit of pineapple, then finished with lime and cilantro. The stuff is traditionally made with pork, so expect a slightly leaner experience with the chicken version. According to Chipotle's press release, the most popular way to order chicken al pastor is in a burrito bowl with white rice, black beans, tomato salsa, roasted chili-corn salsa, cheese, and guacamole, which Nevielle Panthaky, Chipotle's vice president of culinary, says, ""layers for the perfectly balanced bite with the right level of sweetness, acidity, and heat.""
In addition to the relaunch, the press release also announced that several of the countries Chipotle is located in are eligible for free delivery. In the U.S. and Canada, customers ordering chicken al pastor from the Chipotle app, Chipotle.com, and Chipotle.ca will be charged no delivery fees from March 14 through March 24. In the U.K., the same offer applies to chicken al pastor orders over £15 made on Uber Eats from March 14 through March 28. Deliveroo orders in France will also have €0 delivery, with no minimum order from March 14 to March 28.",https://www.mashed.com/1537607/chipotle-chicken-al-pastor-limited-time-return/

The English AI-dubbed version of the series consists of 7 episodes, each lasting about 5 minutes.

CMG's recent growth is due to strong performance of its key brands, new brand launches, data-driven customer marketing, and omni-channel marketing.
""Our vision is to be the leading omni-channel brand retailer and employer of choice. We aim to bring the world's best brands and retail experiences to Thais,"" said company president Edwin Yap Hawson.
""Our commitment to providing our customers with the best brands and highest quality products and services is one factor driving our continued growth, as our net retail sales grew 28% year-on-year in 2023.""
Mr Hawson recently revealed CMG's major strategies going forward.
In order to drive omni-channel in the digital age, brands are aiming for seamless connections at every customer touchpoint.
CMG is emphasising growth of its omni-channel capability, including launching Casio and MLB websites last year. Furthermore, the group opened more than 180 new points of sale last year, bringing its total store number in malls and department stores to more than 2,200, Mr Hawson said.
CMG is always on the lookout for new global brands while strengthening its partnerships with existing brands, said Mr Hawson. Last year, CMG added top brands such as Crocs and Fila to its brand portfolio and took over distribution of Skechers, the American footwear brand, across all Central department stores and CPN malls.
In addition, CMG also launched L:A Bruket, a Swedish organic beauty brand, to address the evolving beauty needs of Thai consumers.
The group recognises its people make the difference, invests in them and offers them progressive career tracks, Mr Hawson said.
CMG won the Kincentric ""Best Employers Award"" for a fifth consecutive year in 2023.
""This year, we will continue to leap ahead of our competition by utilising artificial intelligence analytics, new technology and automation to help our team in improving our operational processes, customer service at-store, omnichannel, and CRM expertise,"" said Mr Hawson.

Despite many others having already done this, I feel somewhat obligated to report on the first 100,000 miles driven in my Tesla Model 3 LR RWD, since this is the very first configuration Tesla sent off the production line in July 2017. In fact, this has made me realize that I need to go find a set of those original 19″ rims to replace my 18″, because it’s a born classic with that look from the very first SN1 vehicle! It also means I have to keep it forever…. Well, let’s see when it caves and has to be shelved. I suspect that will happen many, many years and miles into the future.
My specimen is a black 2019 Long Range with rear-wheel drive. It has a (current) real-world range of just over 250 miles (400 km), which was speculated to be the initial real-world range of the Model 3 long before production. It has declined some 10% since new, but that’s still enough to never make me worry about range. Also, the number of Supercharger stations that have popped up all over Denmark — and Europe — makes any concerns about range a non-issue. By the way, the opening up of Superchargers to non-Tesla vehicles has not been a problem for me on the occasional road trip. And I have also been on a road trip in a Citröen eC4, only using Tesla Superchargers, and that has been no hassle whatsoever.
Total Cost Of Ownership
I documented a lot of details when I reached 100,000 km (62,000 miles), so this time around I will just update the main points:
Price in June 2019 including full self driving (FSD): $67,290 (DKK 463,000).
- Current average resale value according to various local used car sites: $29,000 (DKK 200,000)
- Depreciation: $38,290 (263,000 DKK) = $0.383 per mile (DKK 1.64 per km)
- Total spent on service: $4,840 (DKK 33,312) (Note: A third of this has been replacing several suspension parts due to squeaking noises, some were under warranty, some were not. The rest is 2 windshield replacements, 8 tires, wipers, cabin filters, and wiper fluid, and some noise dampening work — nothing else.)
- Total spent on electricity: $2,953 (DKK 20,327) (Note: Due to kind referrals early on I got more than 10,000 miles of free Supercharging. However, 93% of charging is at home.)
- Total spent on insurance: $5,140 (DKK 35,380)
- Total spent on taxes: $429 (DKK 2,950)
- Total spent on premium connectivity: $349 (DKK 2,400)
- Running cost total of: $13,711 (DKK 94,369) = $0.137 per mile (DKK 0.590 per km)
Total cost of ownership (TCO) so far: $0.52 per mile (DKK 2.23 per km).
So, despite pretty significant depreciation, due to price cuts over the years and new cars getting better and better, making used cars less and less attractive, this is still a very low TCO. If FSD becomes a reality before this car reaches end of life, the story changes completely, but that’s a pie in the sky for now (although, I obviously would not have bought FSD had I not believed in it, which I still do).
Comfort
Does the car feel like new? No, it feels better than new, but that’s only because I had it noise dampened within the first year, which made the sound comfort in the cabin so much better. I’m very happy I made this decision early on. Everything in terms of the mechanics shows no signs of wear (except replacing those suspension parts due to irritating — but not unsafe — squeaking noises), meaning the car still feels new to drive. And remember, this is the rear-wheel drive with the big battery, which gives it more power than the standard range, thus delivering a solid 0–60 mph time of 5 seconds. Nothing crazy, but adds to the fun factor.
Unknowns
There are a couple of unknowns that are worth mentioning. Rust is one. I hear stories about Teslas starting to rust, both older Model 3 and newer Model Y vehicles. I had my car checked a couple of times, and I have nothing out of the ordinary in terms of corrosion, despite the fact that the car sits outside all year round and is exposed to a lot of salt roughly half of the year. This winter has been very challenging, and it made me realize that if you cannot stay at home when it’s snowing heavily, all-season tires are not good enough. I will start using summer and winter tires.
Brakes is another unknown that you have to think about when driving in the type of climate we have here in Denmark. The first couple of years, I drove with maximum regenerative braking (one-pedal driving) to get good range, but I noticed that this made the brake discs rust so much it would make them uneven. I switched to low regen and started to apply my brakes harder occasionally, especially in winter. This has made the discs cleaner and more even again. At 4 years, it passed inspection, but only just, and I was told the discs probably would not pass next time — we shall see. I have also found that if I work the brakes hard a couple of miles before parking, so that the discs have some heat built up, the parking brake pads are less prone to stick, which previously would feel really uncomfortable starting out in the morning with a loud clonking sound as if the pads had been glued to the discs.
Range
Range can be seen three-fold: First, there’s the official WLTP range, which is 600 km (373 miles) for this model. Second, there is the range estimate always shown on screen in the car and in the app. Third, there is the actual range achieved. At new, the car suggested a range of 516 km (321 miles) was possible. Now, it shows 462 km (287 miles). So, that’s down 10.6%. The actual consumption has been very consistent, with a year-round average of 176 Wh/km (283 Wh/mile), or put another way, 5.68 km/kWh (3.53 miles/kWh). Assuming 75 kWh of usable battery capacity, this amounts to an average range of 426 km (265 miles) on a full charge. Adjusting for a possible loss of 10.6% battery capacity, which gives an approximated current usable battery capacity of 67 kWh, the actual range that I would trust a full charge would deliver would be 381 km (237 miles). When people ask me what’s the range of an EV, any EV, I always answer: Forget WLTP and calculate battery capacity × 5 km (3.1 miles). That’s real life for you.
Colin
I still enjoy every single ride in this car. It’s wicked fast, easy to use, and has razor sharp handling. The interior holds up well. There is no visual wear and tear and nothing has come loose anywhere. Comfort is okay for me, but I am well aware it’s nowhere near its competitors, let alone its successor. Yet, as a daily driver, this 1st generation of the Model 3 has proven itself way beyond what I would have expected. (I have read the stories of others having lots of problems, so maybe I’m just lucky?) However, I dare not try out the new Model 3. I am so scared I will abandon “Colin” on the spot. Besides, what would I call a new car? “Colin” is the perfect name … and it stays with this car! Goofy, I know….

March 11, 2024Power has been restored to the Tesla Gigafactory near Berlin on Monday night, grid operator E.DIS said.
Repair work to a damaged pylon was completed at 8:45 p.m. local time (1945 UTC) — much faster than the power company initially expected.
""Since then, the power supply has been restored,"" it said in a statement.
The news comes a week after far-left activists known as the Volcano Group sabotaged the car factory, cutting its electricity on March 5.
Environmentalists have been protesting against the expansion of the Tesla factory, which would require more than 100 hectares of forest to be cleared in Grünheide near a water protection zone.
At the time, Tesla chief Elon Musk called the saboteurs the ""dumbest eco-terrorists in the world.""
Production on track to restart
The sabotage caused the Tesla factory to grind to a halt, preventing the production of 1,000 cars per day and costing the company hundreds of millions of euros.
Before Monday's announcement, Tesla had expected the factory to remain down until the end of the week. It said it would resume its systems gradually once power was restored.
""It is not yet possible to say how long it will take until production can be fully resumed,"" the company told Reuters.
Joerg Steinbach, the economy minister of the state of Brandenburg, said E.DIS employees had been working a three-shift rotation to get the factory back up and running as soon as possible.

The Cybertruck is neither the best nor the worst truck of all time.Pros
- Actually a pretty decent truck
- Gets more attention than Donald Trump
- Drives like a Tesla, charges like a Tesla
Cons
- Compromised in every way by its design
- Spartan interior takes minimalism too far
- Doesn't live up to the hype
You've heard it said that a good compromise leaves everyone upset. Whether you agree with that cynical point of view or not, it perfectly encapsulates the 2024 Tesla Cybertruck. Whether you love the Cybertruck and you're hoping to read it's the greatest truck ever made, or you hate it and you're hoping to read it's a steaming pile, you're going to be disappointed. In truth, it's a pretty good truck hamstrung by a series of needless compromises for the sake of vanity.
Function Follows Form
The Cybertruck would be a better truck were it not for the design. Love its looks or not, its dystopian triangular styling has forced a number of compromises to functionality that are entirely unforced errors. The fact it's as good a vehicle as it is is a testament to Tesla's engineers and an indictment of Elon Musk's insistence on it looking like this.
The pointy roof alone is responsible for a number of visibility problems. The massive pillars needed to support it are only partially offset by the enormous amounts of glass they frame, and then only if you crane your neck far enough. Making a left turn across traffic is particularly perilous as the combination of pillar and door mirror make it very difficult to see traffic coming from the right. That massive single wiper is another concession to the truck's unusual design. Its size and weight mean that at maximum speed it shakes the entire truck.
Behind you, the sloping roof and low-mounted rear crossmember obscure rear visibility, even with the tonneau cover open. Vehicles more than six or seven car lengths behind—a safe following distance freeway speeds—are completely invisible. And likely in the name of saving a few dollars in cost, Tesla eschewed a video screen in the rearview mirror for a rearview camera feed in the large central screen. It makes the physical rearview mirror feel as though it's only there for legal purposes. And while you can move the camera feed to one of two locations on the big display, training yourself to look down to see what's behind you will take quite a lot of time.
Oh, and don't bother trying to see what's behind your Cybertruck if you have the turn signal on, because the video feed from the rear is replaced with one of the blind spot cameras if you have those enabled. Don't try to bring up the vehicle control menu, either, if you have the rearview video feed in the top center of the screen, because the menu goes behind it and blocks access to all the most important controls in a very obvious programming oversight.
Load It Up
Since you can't see anything out the back anyway, the smart thing to do is just leave the tonneau cover closed and enjoy the range benefit. Plus, you won't need to worry about stacking cargo up to the roof, as there's no rear view to block. The vertical space in the bed really helps offset how small the Cybertruck's front trunk is.
While the bed is as large as any other full-size four-door truck's, you can plainly see it's less useful. The massive sail panels make it impossible to reach cargo or tie-down points in the bed from the sides, so your only option is to go in from the back. And if you if you need something that's buried up at the front of the bed, you'll either have to climb over everything else or empty the bed to get to it.
We do appreciate the standard modular tie-down rails on both sides of the bed, though we can't imagine why the movable tie-downs are held in with Torx screws rather than a simple release mechanism. At least you can buy aftermarket parts to connect to them and toss the factory pieces. Regardless, you'll want to connect your tie-down straps to the forward cleats before you load anything else in the bed or you'll never reach them.
Even the pointy door mirrors are a compromise to design. Shaving off the top corners has made it harder to see traffic to either side of you on the highway for no other reason than to make them fit the triangular design motif.
Hitch It Up
As you can imagine, these mirrors make it harder to back a trailer, as well. It's too bad, because the rear steering and super-quick steering ratio make reversing a trailer a breeze. Rather than palming the wheel or going hand over hand to make corrections, you just make small inputs in the steering wheel, and the trailer goes exactly where you want. Hooking up would be easier if Tesla would overlay the path of the hitch on the backup camera screen like other trucks do, but it's not a deal-breaker.
As with any electric truck, towing is effortless. The weight of the trailer makes the Cybertruck accelerate less aggressively and slower to stop, but far less so than in a combustion-powered pickup. Getting up to speed is a breeze if you put your foot in it, as are climbing grades and passing on the highway.
Naturally, towing puts a big dent in range. Tesla says the dual-motor Cybertruck will go 318 miles in Foundation Series trim. We hooked a 3,170-pound Bowlus Volterra travel trailer to it and sawed the range in half to just 160 miles with a mix of highway and suburban driving at an average speed of 50 mph. At least with the abundance of Tesla Superchargers nationwide and newer stations being built to accommodate trucks with trailers, it's less an issue than it's made out to be.
We do wish the Cybertruck were more confident towing over bad pavement, though. By itself, the truck rides shockingly well and makes most bumps disappear under its flamboyant-looking tires. Hook up a trailer, though, and everything changes. Even a fairly light 3,170-pound travel trailer pushes the truck around on rough pavement and wrecks the ride quality. The driver is constantly fighting shunts from the trailer, fraying nerves and sapping confidence.
Reality Check
Back to the Superchargers for a moment, those charging sessions are going to be a bit longer than you might be used to if you' re already a Tesla owner. Although it peaked at 252 kW in our test, the Cybertruck's 123-kWh battery is the biggest Tesla makes, and bigger batteries take longer to fill. Charging from 5 percent to 80 percent took 42 minutes, 10 minutes longer than a Model Y Long Range and just 4 minutes quicker than a Ford F-150 Lightning or Rivian R1T.
That extra time will add up on road trips. Whatever the exact range is, it's far less than the 500 miles Tesla originally promised. In our Road-Trip Range test (driving 70 mph on the highway until the battery drops from 100 percent to 5 percent), the Cybertruck made it just 224 miles. That's 5 miles less than that Model Y despite having a much bigger battery that takes longer to charge. Make sure you plan for that before you head off down the interstate or out into the wilderness.
Range isn't the only undelivered promise. Tesla also originally quoted a payload capacity of up to 3,500 pounds and missed the mark by 1,000 pounds. Still, at 2,500 pounds, the Cybertruck bests the Lightning. Then again, the Ford will tow more than 13,000 pounds, and despite Tesla's promise of a 14,000-pound max, it can actually only pull 11,000. We've already covered the ""bulletproof"" claim, which isn't really something you need (hopefully), and we're not touching the ""float like a boat"" thing. The $40,000 starting price is a definite no. Then there's the matter of it supposedly being ""apocalypse-proof.""
Off-Road It, If You Dare
Do not believe Tesla's hype about the Cybertruck being unstoppable or ready for any terrain in the universe. While they're butched-up with massive sidewall lugs specifically for the Cybertruck, the custom-spec Goodyears actually have much less tread than a standard Goodyear Wrangler Territory all-terrain tire. In order to improve handling and range, they've been shaved down by 4/32 an inch compared to the same tire on a Chevrolet Silverado 1500 ZR2 (the equivalent of thousands of miles of wear), giving it significantly less grip off-road. Worse, they easily cake up with mud, further reducing traction.
On a fairly easy off-road trail, the Cybertruck spun its tires more readily and more often than our support truck, which was wearing its highway tire option. Part of this was an underdeveloped traction control system that allowed far more wheelspin than the support truck before engaging individual brakes to send power to the opposite wheel. A bigger part was the fact that months after customer deliveries began, the differential lockers are still non-functional, which is bizarre because they're simple lockers that are either on or off and should take minimal programming to enable. Then there's the fact you can't overlap the pedals, a very common trick off-road to smooth out driving over big obstacles. It's clear that if Tesla has any off-road experts on its development team, no one is listening to them.
There are other problems off-road, as well. The massive dashboard (don't set things there, or you'll need a trash picker to get them back) makes it difficult to see what's in front of the vehicle even when you get up out of your seat, and the front camera looks a bit too far ahead and isn't pointed far enough down toward the ground. It also strangely enables the rear-facing side cameras rather than the forward-facing ones, so you can't get a look at what's going on around your front wheels and how close you are to obstacles. And there's no way to change this.
Then there's the matter of the aerodynamic spats just in front of the rear tires. They hang down and are prone to catching on obstacles, which will rip them right out of their mounting holes. We also have concerns about the placement of the charging port in the fender flare, where it's in danger of being damaged by trees and rocks during serious off-roading. Oh, and there's the fact the Cybertruck has no standard spare tire. You're definitely gonna want to get one of those before you venture out onto the trail.
If you want to do any actual off-roading with this Tesla, you have some work to do before you hit the trail. In the event of the apocalypse, anyone with a unmodified Cybertruck will want to stick to roads.
By the Numbers
The tires also compromise handling and stopping on pavement. Although it does both competitively, you can tell from behind the squared-off steering yoke it could do even better on a street tire, which Tesla isn't offering as of now. Similarly, it would be far more capable off-road with a real all-terrain tire. These tires are jacks of all trades and masters of none.
This is clear from our test data. Tesla engineers have leveraged their excellent on-road traction control to make the Cybertruck launch harder than a Model 3 Dual Motor. This dual-motor Foundation Series truck packs 593 hp and 525 lb-ft of torque, enough to push the 6,660-pound stainless-steel attention magnet to 60 mph in 3.8 seconds and through a quarter mile in 12.4 seconds at 110.3 mph. That's quick, but a heavier Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum with less power will do it in 4.0 seconds on a street tire, so the Cybertruck's tires are holding it back.
It becomes more obvious stopping and turning. A 126-foot stop from 60 mph is good, but that same chunky Lightning will do it in 118 feet. Put the Tesla into a corner, and it'll pull 0.76 average lateral g, slightly less than the Lightning's 0.77. It only gets worse in our figure-eight test, where the Cybertruck needs 27.3 seconds to complete a lap at 0.67 g average to the Ford's 27.1 seconds at 0.68 g average. This despite the Tesla's lighter weight, greater power, quick-ratio steer-by-wire, and rear steering.
And while all the steering tech makes the truck feel super maneuverable, at 43.5 feet, its turning circle is basically the same as any other full-size pickup truck's, making you wonder how bad it would be if it didn't have rear steering. At least there's no clumsy fumbling with the steering yoke like you get in the Model S and X. In the Cybertruck, it turns from lock to lock in less than 360 degrees.
As you'd expect, there's zero steering feel in this entirely by-wire system. This, combined with the ride quality and the general isolation from the outside world, makes the Cybertruck feel slower than it actually is. You never quite feel like the truck is accelerating as quickly as the stats say it is or that you're going as fast as the speedometer says.
Around corners, it handles more like a Range Rover than a pickup truck. It's very similar to the way a Rivian R1T handles: excellent for a truck, great for an SUV, and pretty good for a sedan. It's hardly a supercar as Musk has suggested, but it is fun to a point, even as the notion lingers that the tires are holding it back. Whereas that Rivian feels like you can just keep leaning on it, there comes a point with the Cybertruck where you don't want to push any harder because you know it's just going to understeer. That limit is high, but it clearly could be higher.
The Same on The Inside
The steering yoke exists, so far as we understand, because Musk wanted it to. While the setup isn't applied properly to the Model S and X, the engineers took this opportunity to get it right. Even with the super-quick steering ratio, though, the squircle-shaped yoke is little more than a novelty. Honestly, it's so small it feels like steering a nearly 3.5-ton truck with a Nintendo Switch.
It's another flagrant concession to design. Up until now, Tesla has successfully rebranded minimalist interior design as chic and forward-thinking. The Cybertruck takes it so far, though, that it appears unfinished. All straight lines and no physical controls to speak of beyond the steering wheel and pedals, it looks more like a placeholder than a finished interior, something you'd see in an early-iteration concept car or a movie prop.
As with other Teslas, the move away from physical controls creates a situation in which basic functions are a multistep process. The massive windshield wiper doesn't have an automatic mode yet, so turning it on requires pushing a touch-sensitive button on the steering wheel and then selecting a speed on the screen. That's two different controls in two different places to do something that nearly everyone else does with one physical control.
Bringing Back Panel Gaps
The interior is assembled well, but we couldn't say the same for the exterior. Most of the advancements the Model 3 made in build quality and panel alignment didn't apply to this Cybertruck. This brand-new $100,000 truck had multiple panels that didn't line up with their neighbors, including one that didn't fit flush at all. There were sharp stainless-steel corners sticking out in multiple places where they shouldn't, and the panel gaps range from just uneven to downright atrocious. Look in your sideview mirrors, and you can see the waves in the body panels themselves. You can also see the smudgy fingerprints down the trailing edge of each door; these will be a permanent calling card for Cybertrucks because that's where everyone grabs the doors to close them.
The Truck as Statement Piece
All of this said, there's a certain honesty to the Cybertruck. In a world saturated with overland builds festooned with every piece of off-road equipment known to man but which never leave the pavement, the Cybertruck speaks plainly. Everyone knows you bought it because you think it looks cool and everyone you know and will ever meet will want to take pictures of it and go for a ride in it. In the land of pavement machines, the Cybertruck rules.

Were you one of those kids who taught themselves to identify cars at night by their headlights and taillights? I was. I was also one of those kids with a huge box of Hot Wheels and impressive collection of home-made Lego hot rods. I asked my parents for a Power Wheels Porsche 911 for Christmas for years, though the best I got was a pedal-powered tractor. I drove the wheels off it. I used to tell my friends I’d own a “slug bug” one day. When I was 15, my dad told me he would get me a car on the condition that I had to maintain it. He came back with a rough-around-the-edges 1967 Volkswagen Beetle he’d picked up for something like $600. I drove the wheels off that thing, too, even though it was only slightly faster than the tractor. When I got tired of chasing electrical gremlins (none of which were related to my bitchin’ self-installed stereo, thank you very much), I thought I’d move on to something more sensible. I bought a 1986 Pontiac Fiero GT and got my first speeding ticket in that car during the test drive. Not my first-ever ticket, mind you. That came behind the wheel of a Geo Metro hatchback I delivered pizza in during high school. I never planned to have this job. I was actually an aerospace engineering major in college, but calculus and I had a bad breakup. Considering how much better my English grades were than my calculus grades, I decided to stick to my strengths and write instead. When I made the switch, people kept asking me what I wanted to do with my life. I told them I’d like to write for a car magazine someday, not expecting it to actually happen. I figured I’d be in newspapers, maybe a magazine if I was lucky. Then this happened, which was slightly awkward because I grew up reading Car & Driver, but convenient since I don’t live in Michigan. Now I just try to make it through the day without adding any more names to the list of people who want to kill me and take my job.

Dive Brief:
- The Biden administration wants to know how the widespread adoption of Tesla’s North American Charging Standard could affect its electric vehicle charging standards for projects funded by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, according to a request for information published Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Highway Administration.
- The FHWA wants to learn more about the NACS’ technical compatibility with existing regulations and safety, the challenges and benefits of implementing it at charging stations and the projected future demand for Combined Charging System and J1772 connectors.
- The agency also wants input on adopting performance-based standards to “reduce the need for future regulatory updates or changes as technology evolves,” according to the RFI. Comments on the RFI are due April 5.
Dive Insight:
After SAE International created industry standards for Tesla’s NACS last June, most major automakers, including General Motors, Ford Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp., announced plans to switch from the Combined Charging Standard plug to Tesla’s North American Charging Standard port for their EVs.
The change, according to some experts, could spur greater EV adoption in the U.S. by improving the public charging experience, which has gotten worse, according to J.D. Power. Tesla’s Supercharger network for EV charging has significantly higher customer satisfaction scores than other networks, J.D. Power found in August.
However, the NEVI Formula Program, which grants money to states to install EV charging infrastructure, requires public charging stations to have at least one permanent CCS Type 1 connector to ensure they are compatible with CCS-equipped vehicles.
While CCS was supposed to be the industry standard for EV charging in the U.S., the NACS is rapidly gaining traction, potentially making the FHWA’s rules — finalized in February 2023 — obsolete. Although the FHWA’s regulations allow states to use NEVI Formula Program funds to install EV charging stations with non-CCS connectors, the shift to the NACS may pose unforeseen implementation challenges.
The agency said a performance-based standard would specify the level of service and vehicle types an EV charging station would need to support but would not require specific connectors.",https://www.wardsauto.com/news/archive-auto-fhwa-rfi-tesla-north-america-charging-standard-nevi/709697/

Tesla’s Next Major Growth Phase May Be Years Away
Evercore Cites Wait for New, Lower-Cost Model
Tesla Inc. is likely years away from fully ramping a new lower-cost model, which will take the company longer than Wall Street is assuming, Evercore analysts said after touring the carmaker’s Texas factory.
“Tesla increasingly is a ‘2027 story,’ ” Evercore analysts led by Chris McNally wrote in a report March 11. He questioned whether the best-case scenario for a cheaper vehicle colloquially referred to as Model 2 is more like 500,000 units in 2026 rather than a consensus of 1 million-plus.
CEO Elon Musk has said Tesla is “between two major growth waves,” with the first underpinned by the Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover and the second expected from a cheaper next-generation electric vehicle. The company expects to start production of this EV toward the end of 2025 at its plant in Austin.
The next-gen model’s bill of materials will decline from $28,000 to $20,000 and likely have around 250 miles of range and no glass roof, McNally wrote. A “big debate” will be whether Tesla’s driver-assistance hardware will be standard, he said, citing his team’s belief that the hardware could cost $2,000 to $3,000.
Evercore now expects Tesla to deliver around 2.7 million vehicles in 2026, meaning its estimate for earnings per share that year is now 18% to 20% below consensus.

The Detroit automaker said on Tuesday that Gerald Johnson, executive vice president of Global Manufacturing and Sustainability, will pass the baton to Jens Peter ""JP"" Clausen, a former executive with Tesla, Lego and, most recently, Google.
Johnson's departure isn't unexpected after a 44-year tenure with the automaker, however GM also announced another more surprising departure on Tuesday: that of Mike Abbott, executive vice president of software and services.
GM said Abbott, a former Apple executive who started with the automaker in May, will be stepping down due to health reasons.
In a LinkedIn post, Abbott said since late last year he has been ""facing some serious health issues involving my heart that have not improved."" He continued, ""as a father and husband, i need to prioritize my recovery and be with my family with the hope that my health will improve over time.""
Baris Cetinok, current vice president of product in software and services, has been named Abbott's interim replacement while a search is conducted. Cetinok, also a former Apple executive, started with GM in September.
The changes are effective April 2, but GM said Johnson will remain with automaker through the rest of the year.
The hiring of Clausen is particularly notable, as GM and other automakers attempt to match or surpass Tesla in manufacturing batteries and powertrains for electric vehicles.
Clausen spent nearly 14 years at toymaker Lego, then joined Tesla during a period of extensive growth and tumult at the company, from 2015 to 2019.
Reporting to CEO Elon Musk and former CTO JB Straubel, Clausen served as vice president of Tesla's first battery manufacturing plant, known as the Nevada Gigafactory, outside of Reno.
Clausen led a rapid expansion of that factory and before he left had been tasked with finding ways for Tesla to reduce the amount of scrap and waste it was generating while the EV maker was growing from a niche player to a mass-market autos business.
When Clausen joined Tesla, the now U.S. EV leader was producing its higher-end sedan, the Model S, and its falcon-wing Model X SUV. By the time he left, the company had begun mass manufacturing and delivering its entry-level Model 3 sedan, which remains its most accessible electric car.
After his tenure at Tesla, Clausen worked at Zymergen, a synthetic biology company funded by Softbank and later acquired by a big competitor, Gingko Bioworks. After the merger, Clausen moved on to a role at Google as a vice president of engineering for the company's Data Center Advanced Technology Innovation group, where he worked on environmentally responsible cooling solutions for data centers, among other sustainable growth initiatives.
Clausen's last day with Google will be March 29, a spokesperson for the company said in an e-mail.
Clausen is not the only ex-Tesla executive to join GM. The company's board members include former Tesla President of Global Sales and Service Jon McNeill and it recently hired Kurt Kelty, who led Tesla battery development for 11 years, as its vice president of batteries.",https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/12/gm-hires-ex-tesla-google-exec-to-lead-manufacturing.html

One of the biggest hard rock bands to come out of the ‘80s, Tesla exemplifies that era, including both peak musicianship and entertainment. While their fans and attendees came out to take a one-night trip down memory lane, Tesla recognizes that it’s a balancing act between creating that almost time-machine esq experience, while still incorporating newer tracks and wanting to remind fans they do offer more than their classic hits.
From playing a new track like “Time to Rock” with its super old school, classic rock vibe to a rock block of their day-one smash hits, Tesla didn’t let up off the gas once during their 16-song, 90-plus-minute set. Even more impressive, outside of their dozen or so must-play staples, Tesla hand-picks all of the other songs they’re playing that night right before the show starts, keeping them on their toes as performers, but also creating a unique, one-of-a-kind show experience each time you see them.
Keepin’ it real 100% of the time, perfect shows and not-so-perfect shows, Tesla have always kept it authentic since day one all while radiating showmanship. Filled with infectious melodies, dueling guitar solos, great crowd engagement and banter, and high-level energy, Tesla is still performing just like they did in the ‘80s. It’s exactly this style of ’70’s classic rock mixed with ‘80’s hair metal edge that created such a perfect formula for the act resulting in multiple platinum albums and chart-topping hits.
Digging even deeper, their songwriting ability of placing importance on storytelling within their music along with their incredibly talent guitar elements. Whether it’s groovy melodies, solos, or switching between acoustic and electric on a dime, Tesla recognized what it takes to craft art that stands the test of time, music that if listened to in any year can have an impact on a listener. A bonus to this is their consistency as an act. Both consistency in activity where as they didn’t experience very many major breaks in their career and consistency in the quality of their live performance still killing it every night on tour to this day. You rarely find legacy acts of this caliber still around. Whether it’s playing new tracks or old ones, performing to a sold-out crowd at the Four Winds Casino or opening up for a massive arena tour, Tesla can’t get enough of being on stage and spending time with their fans.

- Tesla's Full Self Driving system earned the worst marks, but most of the 14 systems tested poorly.
- Some say that autonomous and assisted driving systems are responsible for fatal crashes.
You may want to think twice before flipping on your autonomous driving system on the highway.
The vast majority of partial driving automation systems — which generally include cruise control, cooperative steering, and obstacle monitoring — earned dismal ratings in a series of tests conducted by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, an independent safety inspector.
""Some drivers may feel that partial automation makes long drives easier, but there is little evidence it makes driving safer,"" said agency president David Harkey in a statement. ""As many high-profile crashes have illustrated, it can introduce new risks when systems lack the appropriate safeguards.""
The agency tested 14 systems, 11 of which received a ""poor"" overall safety rating. Among those 11 were Tesla's Autopilot — the EV maker's more traditional highway system — and its ""Full Self Driving"" system, which works on city and suburban streets.
The tests found that ""Full Self Driving"" — a feature that, as of last month, was available in beta to about 400,000 Tesla drivers — was the most unsafe, with only two categories rated ""acceptable"" and none rated ""good.""
The system performed inadequately in driver monitoring — i.e. detecting when drivers take their hands off the wheel — and in adaptive cruise control, which tested whether cruise control remained active while the driver's attention was off the road.
That's despite Tesla's in-cabin camera, which is supposed to make sure drivers are paying attention on the road.
Tesla also earned ""poor"" marks in how it handles cooperative steering — how easy it is to steer away from obstacles or potholes without disengaging the system — and disengaging safety features.
Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment before publication.
Last year, the company recalled over 2 million vehicles due to similar concerns over Autopilot, stemming from an ongoing investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The tests in the safety report were conducted before the recall, CNN reported.
Multiple lawsuits against Tesla claim that Autopilot is responsible for various crashes, some of them fatal.
Despite the controversy surrounding its automated driving features, Tesla was far from the only automaker to receive a dismal safety score.
Automated driving systems from Ford, Genesis, and Mercedes-Benz also received ""poor"" ratings. Two systems, from Nissan and General Motors, received a ""marginal"" rating, while Lexus's Teammate system (available in the 2022-24 LS) was the sole ""acceptable"" system.
The agency did not assign any system a ""good"" overall safety score.
A Genesis spokesman said the company was ""aware"" of its rating and pointed to the company's record as ""among the leaders"" in Insurance Institute safety designations. He added that Genesis will introduce an in-cabin camera to its upcoming models.
A spokeswoman for Ford described the automaker's Blue Cruise technology as a ""highly effective driver monitoring system,"" adding that ""while we do not agree with IIHS's findings, we will take their feedback into consideration as we continue to evaluate future updates.""
The other companies did not immediately return requests for comment before publication.
Despite the safety concerns, self-driving cars are becoming more of a reality. Earlier this month, California regulators approved Waymo, a self-driving taxi agency, to expand its operations in Los Angeles and San Francisco.

There are a few things you may not know about the rock band Tesla: The band formed in Sacramento, California, in 1984. The band's name is in honor of the inventor Nikola Tesla. Frontman Jeff Keith is a fan of country music and is honored to get to once again play onstage at the famed Ryman Auditorium.
""I love country,"" Keith told The Tennessean. ""I am a country boy at heart. Country music was a big part of my life growing up. The older-school country like George Jones, Merle Haggard and that kind of stuff.""
He said the band has played the Ryman at least twice before and that playing there — especially as a rock band — is special.
""I'll tell you what, when you get up on that stage at The Ryman, it's incredible,"" he said. ""The history of that place ... so many people have poured their hearts out on that stage, so to have a chance to play there is a really big deal.""
Unlikely friendship with country music's Bailey Zimmerman
While Keith said he grew up on old-school country, when we asked him who he is listening to now, he said Bailey Zimmerman.
The two met a few years back when Zimmerman and his mom came to a Tesla show. He told Keith that his first concert was Tesla when he was 8.
""We just became really good friends,"" Keith said. ""He is a great, talented young man. My wife and my son and daughter and I just went to his show outside of Sacramento and had so much fun. His band is great, and we just had a blast. Now when we play The Ryman, he is going to come down to the Tesla show.""
While Zimmerman isn't expected to get onstage with the band, Keith said there could be a future collaboration.
""Our plan is to someday, it's on our bucket list, to write a song together.""
40 years of making music and still going
Tesla formed in 1984 and in 1986 released their debut platinum album ""Mechanical Resonance,"" which included the hits ""Modern Day Cowboy"" and ""Little Suzi."" They followed that with 1989's ""The Great Radio Controversy,"" which produced hits such as ""Heaven's Trail (No Way Out)"" and ""Love Song.""
It was 1990's ""Five Man Acoustical Jam"" that was a catalyst to the unplugged movement when many rock bands literally unplugged their electric instruments and played acoustically. This album included the band's biggest single, a cover of Five Man Electrical Band's ""Signs.""
While many bands from the '80s didn't survive the grunge movement of the '90s, Tesla kept playing, writing and recording and has released nine new albums since 2000. Keith said the band is eyeing their next record.
""We are still going strong,"" he said. ""We're having fun with it, and it shows. We are still writing songs and plan on making another record, which takes time. Right now we are so busy playing live, we only have time to put out singles here and there.""
Did Keith envision when the band formed 40 years ago that it would still be making records and performing live?
""Nope. We had no idea, but that's what it has turned out to be.""

But what is it actually like to live with?
We’re about to find out as I begin a 24-hour fling with the Cybertruck in and around Los Angeles. So, what do you want to know? What do you want me to poke, pull, or prod? What would you like to see smushed by its guillotine-esque hood closing action?
The one disclaimer: we can’t break anything on purpose. This Cybertruck comes to us via the fine folks at Turo and an enthusiastic early adopter named Chris, and we promised to take care of it. (Thanks, Chris.)
I’ll start with some early observations; first, this thing is sharp! I’m not talking about good looks, although it certainly turns heads. I’m not someone who covets attention, so the slack-jawed stares, iPhones hanging out windows, and stoplight conversations are a bit much. I’m talking rough edges, slice-a-finger-open sharp. The front and rear quarter panels in particular feel anything but kid-tested, parent-approved.
Second, you feel like you’re sitting about a mile behind the front axle, thanks to the rake of the windshield and the massive dash. It’s the one thing the Cybertruck and the Toyota Prius have in common.
The super-quick four-wheel steer-by-wire has taken some getting used to, as has the truck’s overall width and size—I’m coming out of a first-generation Mini Cooper S, which is pretty much this truck’s polar opposite as long as we’re sticking with four-wheeled vehicles with license plates. Its acceleration and agility are impressive, though.
Finally, a couple of build quality issues have stood out in early testing. The truck’s rearview mirror feels extremely cheap and flimsy. The driver’s side mirror also shakes in its housing over road bumps. I get that the emphasis is on the cameras, but for six figures a Foundation Series Cybertruck costs, it’s disappointing.
So, what burning questions do you have? What’s something that can only be answered with hands-on experience? Let us know, and we’ll do our best to figure it all out. For you!",https://www.thedrive.com/car-reviews/were-driving-a-tesla-cybertruck-for-24-hours-what-do-you-want-to-know

The days of non-Teslas using its network have arrived.
Ford F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E retail customers recently became the first of any non-Tesla automaker to gain access to Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada. This gives them access to 15,000+ available Tesla Superchargers which Ford says more than doubles its customer access to reliable DC fast charging on its own BlueOval Charge Network.
In sharing the news, Ford cited a Cox Automotive Consumer Sentiment Study that finds a lack of charging stations is the second largest barrier after price when it comes to purchasing an electric vehicle. It says as EV prices come down, improving access to reliable fast charging is critical to help more customers confidently choose an EV.
On February 29, 2024 Ford President and CEO Jim Farley had this to say:
""Starting today, Ford EV customers will have access to more than 15,000 Tesla Superchargers across the U.S. and Canada, more than doubling fast charging options on the BlueOval Charge Network. This move will improve the public charging experience by giving our customers even more choice and is a vital part of our growth as an EV brand. I would like to thank Elon and the Tesla team for their close collaboration and Tesla’s leadership to help change the lives of so many EV customers through improved access to charging.” - Ford President and CEO Jim Farley.
Right now, Ford EV owners need an adaptor to use the Tesla Superchargers. Ford says as a thank you to its EV customers, its making the Fast Charging Adapter available at no cost to new and existing customers enrolled in the BlueOval Charge Network through June 30, 2024. After that it will cost future EV owners $320 to purchase one (including estimated tax and shipping). Ford says its retail EV customers are the first in the industry to have the opportunity to order the Fast Charging Adapter.
If you're a Ford Pro Commercial customer Ford says you'll be contacted by mail this Spring at the address registered with Ford Pro or via their Ford Pro account manager to order an adapter.
Ford EV customers don't need to use a credit card site. Rather they can pay on the BlueOval Charge Network with a stored payment account through the FordPass App, or Charge Assist App (soon to be ""Public Charge"") in the vehicle’s touchscreen. Once owners have created an account and activated Plug & Charge, Tesla Superchargers will support Plug & Charge with Ford EVs. So customers just plug in and charging prices will be managed through FordPass.
In the future, Ford says it will begin offering next-generation electric vehicles with the North American Charging Standard (NACS) connector built-in, so EV owners won't need an adaptor.
Other automakers have also made deals with Tesla to use its Supercharging network. They include Acura, GM, BMW, Fisker, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar, Kia, Genesis, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Rivian, Polestar, and Volvo.

Tesla did not immediately comment on the new findings. In the past, it has said its autopilot system is about 10 times safer than the U.S. average.
In all, researchers tested 14 systems. Only one earns an acceptable rating, two are rated marginal and 11 are rated poor.
""Most of them don’t include adequate measures to prevent misuse and keep drivers from losing focus on what’s happening on the road,"" IIHS President David Harkey said in a statement.
Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety President Cathy Chase said the Department of Transportation needs to set minimum standards to ensure driver and passenger safety.
""The new IIHS report sheds a critical light on the inadequacies of some of the advanced driver assistance systems,"" she said. ""We weren’t particularly surprised, considering there are no minimum federal safety standards. Automakers can put any systems that they want in the cars.""

We strap our equipment to the mid-grade Cybertruck.Whether it's scaling Hell's Revenge or the walls at The Beverly Hills Hotel, the 2024 Tesla Cybertruck has proven it has the thrust to perform outrageous feats. But can it outrun its competition from Ford and Rivian?
To find out, we got our hands on a 2024 Cybertruck Dual Motor Foundation Series, which Tesla says should accelerate from 0-60 mph in 4.1 seconds. We easily bested that time with a 3.8-second run to 60 mph before crossing the quarter mile line in 12.4 seconds at 110.3 mph, just a touch below the Cybertruck Dual Motor's claimed top speed of 112 mph (we actually reached 114 mph in our testing).
Not bad for truck that tipped our scales at 6,660 pounds. Like other non-performance Teslas, testing the Cybertruck Dual Motor was simple. It starts by selecting the Dynamics submenu within the main vehicle settings screen. From there, tap Sport under the Drive Mode options. Sport mode adjusts acceleration settings from Chill to Standard, shifts ride and handling from Relaxed to Focused, and adjusts the ride height to its lowest setting.
With no launch control procedure to fuss with, achieving the quickest straight-line numbers was just a matter of mashing the accelerator. Any attempt at launching with pedal overlap results in a warning message indicating that power to both front and rear motors has been reduced. With 593 horsepower and 525 lb-ft of torque on tap, the Cybertruck accelerates strong off the line, but dips in intensity as you approach the quarter mile.
This version of the Cybertruck is quick, but not quite quick enough to turn its competition into cyberdust. For starters, our test of a 2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Lariat tied the Cybertruck to 60 mph and the quarter mile. The Ford is heavier (6,794 pounds) and makes less horsepower than the Tesla (575 hp), but churns out more torque (775 lb-ft). Meanwhile, a 2023 Rivian R1T Dual Motor Performance we tested outguns both the Tesla and the Ford with a 0-60 mph run of 3.3 seconds and a quarter mile time of 12.0 seconds at 109.1 mph. That said, this version of the Rivian makes significantly more power at 665 hp and 829 lb-ft . There's a tamer version of the R1T Dual Motor (533 hp and 610 lb-ft) that we'll hopefully test in the near future. We're also eager to get our hands on the 834-hp Cyberbeast, which Tesla says will accelerate to 60 mph in a blistering 2.6 seconds. If that number holds up, that'll be the quickest electric truck we will have tested, a record currently held by the GMC Hummer EV truck, at 3.0 seconds.

Collective bargaining, which sees employers and unions agree to minimum pay and conditions for all employees, “is the backbone of the Nordic economic and labour model”, says Kiran Aziz, head of responsible investments at KLP, which is among the group that has written to Tesla’s board over the issue.
With NKr760bn (€67bn) in assets under management at the end of 2023, KLP is Norway’s biggest pension fund and holds around $163m-worth of Tesla shares.
Tesla’s business in Scandinavia has been paralysed by industrial action for more than four months after the electric vehicle (EV) giant refused to sign a collective bargaining agreement with its 100-plus workers in Sweden.
A strike starting last October by members of Swedish union IF Metall who work at Tesla repair workshops has sparked sympathy strikes and blockades by 12 other unions across Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland. Collectively, these countries comprise the fourth biggest market for new car sales in the world. Across Scandinavia, Tesla charging stations are not being serviced, number plates not delivered and vehicles not offloaded from ships.
The situation has been billed as a culture clash between Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who openly opposes unionisation, and the Nordics, where more than 60% of workers are part of unions. KLP is part of a group of pension funds across the region which hold shares in Tesla, and have collectively $1tn in assets under management, that have joined the unions in pushing back against the EV maker by pressuring its board to reconsider its approach to unions.
Sweden has become a flashpoint for Tesla’s refusal to enter collective bargaining in any market. Some 90% of Swedish workers are covered by these agreements, in part because the country has no legal minimum wage. “When [companies] enter the Swedish market and they come with terms that are totally not in line with the practices here, it gives [added] importance” to labour market best practice, says Ms Aziz.
However, she insists that KLP is taking a global view of the issue, and hopes its stance on Tesla has “a signal effect” and positive impact further afield. “As a global investor, there are certain expectations we have, regardless of where the company is based or operating,” she says. “Basic collective bargaining through a trade union [is a] human right recognised in international treaties, conventions and declarations.”
Tesla has not replied to the pension fund group’s letter, which it sent last December. “We are trying to figure out how to escalate,” says Ms Aziz. When KLP disagrees with the management of a company in its portfolio, it first tries to establish a dialogue with the company, before moving to outline its expectations to the board. As with all companies, she says the next step with Tesla could be filing a shareholder proposal at its annual general meeting.
Unsustainable EVs
Tesla’s stand-off with Scandinavia’s unions and pension funds has sparked doubts over whether the world’s most famous manufacturer of EVs — a symbol of the green transition — is a sustainable investment. After IF Metall had tried for five years to secure a collective bargaining agreement with Tesla, KLP responded by dropping the company from its sustainability funds. “We did that before [the strikes began], because our portfolio managers were seeing that it [would] come to some controversy,” says Ms Aziz. KLP now holds its Tesla shares in other funds.
PensionDanmark, which also signed the group letter, went a step further and responded by selling its $70m-worth of Tesla shares on December 6. When asked if KLP would follow suit, Ms Aziz says: “Exclusion is the last tool we have, but this is where things have to be really unacceptable.” Her priority is to “make sure that we can at least establish a dialogue with Tesla's management and board”.
The situation shines yet another light on the discrepancies plaguing the path towards a clean economy. “Tesla has done a great job when it comes to the green transition. We need to give it credit for what it has done,” says Ms Aziz. “But it’s about a holistic approach to sustainability.”",https://www.fdiintelligence.com/content/34b8dfc9-df99-5ec5-ac57-2d0f7372f4d2

A New York Times investigation published this weekend revealed that approximately half of the tax-deductible donations made by the Musk Foundation in 2021 and 2022 benefited in some way the tycoon’s business interests, partners, or family.
Among the beneficiaries reported by the Times was a Texas county that was showered by metal debris from one of Musk’s SpaceX rockets, as well as a Pennsylvania billionaire who fell short of a donation target after chartering his space company’s services.
Also on the list was Musk’s nonprofit school, Ad Astra, where five of the dozen or so students happened to be his own offspring.
The Tesla CEO—and the second-wealthiest person on the planet—also donated $100 million to a charity that bought property next to a housing development occupied by his Boring Company employees, land records showed. The foundation that received the funds is run by none other than the head of Musk’s family office, Jared Birchall, who manages the titan’s personal fortune.
In total, tax filings seen by the newspaper show Musk’s nonprofit gave away $160 million in 2022—the last year for which records are available. Yet as tax law requires 5% of a foundation’s assets every year go to charitable causes, he was seemingly $193 million short of his legal requirements—among the very worst in the country.
Musk did not respond to requests for comment.
Back in March 2022 Fortune cited philanthropy experts warning Musk’s foundation might in reality just serve to lower his personal tax bill with little to no intent in distributing the cash, by employing a loophole known as donor-advised funds (DAFs).
Musk says his companies are philanthropic in spirit
Musk has a habit of making generous promises that earn positive publicity, then being shaky on the follow-through. The New York Times cited for example his broken pledge to fix the contaminated water supply in Flint, Mich., or a failed promise to donate $6 billion to the World Food Programme if it could come up with a concrete spending proposal.
Likewise, instead of delivering ventilators during the pandemic, Tesla bought cheaper BiPAP machines and then slapped a Tesla sticker on the box. And while Musk pledged to finance the legal defense of those “canceled” because of their Twitter posts, the only case he has taken on thus far is a Gina Carano lawsuit filed against his personal nemesis, Disney CEO Bob Iger—over a post she made on rival platform Instagram.
When it comes to a Saudi sentenced to death for criticizing the royal family on Twitter, he has been silent.
Musk does maintain that the very nature of his work is, in its own right, philanthropic. Whether it be Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink or others, he believes the companies he built into multibillion-dollar giants are helping the world already and should be considered as such.
“If you say philanthropy is a love of humanity, they are philanthropy,” he said during a TED Talk interview in April 2022.
In November 2023 Musk added he has “done more for the environment than everyone—any single human on Earth” courtesy of his work developing electric vehicles at Tesla.
“What I care about is the reality of goodness, not the perception of it,” Musk told the New York Times DealBook Summit. “And what I see all over the place is people who care about looking good while doing evil.”
In recent weeks the X owner has made principled stands on how he believes individuals and organizations should handle their donations and profits.
Last week Musk accused Jeff Bezos’s former wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Scott, of threatening the future of Western civilization over her philanthropic causes (though he later took the post down). He also sued OpenAI for breach of agreement by turning the nonprofit into a for-profit company, only for emails to later claim he was once in favor of the plan.",https://fortune.com/2024/03/11/elon-musk-tesla-billionaire-charity-donation-non-profit-foundation/

The family of the 50-year-old announced her tragic death in a statement back in February but did not provide any details about what happened.
The Wall Street Journal reported Chao’s Tesla Model X SUV became submerged in the pond on the property in Blanco County after she put the car in reverse instead of drive during a three-point turn. Attempts to rescue Chao in the submerged vehicle were unsuccessful due to the terrain and other factors, the Wall Street Journal said.
Newspaper Austin American-Statesman received a three-page report from Blanco County Emergency Services describing the incident after it submitted a Texas Public Information Act request since the sheriff’s office would only release limited details on the incident.
The report said first responders tried to rescue Chao from the submerged car for over an hour. A tow truck called to the scene had difficulty pulling the vehicle out of the water because its chains were not long enough to reach it, the Austin American-Statesman said, based on the report.
Deputies stood on the submerged vehicle and used tools to break the vehicle's windows, the report said.
After Chao was pulled from the vehicle, EMS attempted ""advanced life support"" for 43 minutes to try to resuscitate her, but she was ultimately pronounced dead at the scene, the report said.
Death of Mitch McConnell's sister-in-law being investigated
Angela Chao, a shipping CEO, died after the vehicle she was in crashed on private property in Texas.
Last week, the Blanco County Sheriff's Office wrote a letter to the Texas attorney general stating, ""This incident was not a typical accident” and “Although the preliminary investigation indicated this was an unfortunate accident, the Sheriff’s Office is still investigating this accident as a criminal matter until they have sufficient evidence to rule out criminal activity,” according to CNBC.
Austin American-Statesman reported the private property where Chao died is owned by a trust that shares the same Chicago address as an investment and public equity firm owned by her husband, Jim Breyer, based on public records.
Chao was the chair and CEO of her family's shipping business, the Foremost Group, and the president of her father's philanthropic organization, the Foremost Foundation. She lived in Austin, which is about 50 miles east of Blanco County.
Chao was the youngest of six sisters to immigrant parents who moved to the U.S. from China in the late 1950s. Her eldest sibling, Elaine, served as transportation secretary under President Donald Trump and labor secretary under President George W. Bush.
""Angela's name in Chinese sounds like the characters for peace and prosperity,"" her father, James S.C. Chao, said in the family statement. ""Her absence leaves a void not only in our hearts, but in the Asian-American community.""
Her father was named chairman of Foremost Group following her death. Michael Lee, a former president, was named president.",https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/angela-chao-died-after-her-tesla-backed-into-a-pond-reports-say

Which installers and battery vendors top the US distributed solar-plus-storage leaderboard?
The US solar industry had a strong 2023. The total market increased a remarkable 51% from 2022, with 32.4 GWdc of capacity installed. All segments set record annual installation volumes except for community solar, which was within 5 MWdc of an annual record.
Solar-plus-storage also saw growth. Residential solar-plus-storage deployments came in 13% above 2022 volumes, with nearly 106,000 projects installed. In the non-residential segment, 5% of solar installations were solar-plus-storage (up from 4.5% in 2022).
2023 was not without obstacles for industry players, however. With high interest rates, permitting and interconnection delays, and falling module prices, installers and equipment manufacturers faced unique challenges even in a growth environment.
In Wood Mackenzie’s quarterly US PV Leaderboard and US Distributed Solar-plus-storage Leaderboard, both available via the US Distributed Solar Service, we rank the top solar installers and equipment suppliers. Read on for an overview of our key findings from 2023. You can also fill in the form for a complimentary copy of the 15-page executive summary of our US solar market insight 2023 year in review.
Seven of the top ten residential solar installers lost market share in 2023
While the residential segment grew by 12% from 2022 with 6.8 MWdc installed, this growth was largely supported by installation backlogs from a robust year of sales in 2022. This backlog was especially large in California, where Net Billing Tariff demand-pull in drove growth in 2023. Outside of California, customer acquisition costs, rising interest rates, and consumer hesitancy challenged the industry.
2023 was a tumultuous year for many of the nation’s leading installers. Tesla, ADT Solar, and Sunrun lost 2.2, 1.9, and 1.5 points of market share from 2022, respectively. In Q1 2024, ADT announced it would exit the solar business, citing operational difficulties and macroeconomic headwinds as key challenges. Throughout the year, Sunrun and Tesla saw declining deployments, and anecdotal evidence suggests that they increasingly rely on subcontractors for installations. The only top 10 residential solar installers to gain market share in 2023 were Freedom Forever (ranked #2), Trinity Solar Power (ranked #4), and Momentum Solar (ranked #7).
While the top ten installers combined for 31% of the market compared to 36% in 2022, we expect consolidation in 2024. Bankruptcy announcements from 2023 will impact 2024 installation data. Furthermore, with a forecasted 13% contraction for the residential solar market in 2024 driven by high interest rates and California’s net billing transition, more long-tail installers are at risk of going out of business.
Oversupply and UFLPA enforcement shape 2023 residential module supplier market
2023 saw massive decreases in residential module prices. Oversupply was driven by increasing module imports and a slowdown in residential solar deployments. The low-price environment had a clear impact on premium module suppliers Qcells and Maxeon Solar Technologies. Both companies experienced market share declines of over 2 percentage points compared to 2022.
Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) enforcement also played an important role in shaping 2023 market shares. Companies that faced less scrutiny like JA Solar and Canadian saw significant market share increases, while companies receiving the more intense scrutiny, like LONGI, suffered losses. JA solar saw its market share climb from 3.4% in 2022 to 8.2% in 2023 to claim the #2 spot among residential module suppliers. Similarly Canadian Solar gained 1.3 points of market share from 2023, marking its second consecutive year of market share growth. LONGi, however, saw its market share fall nearly 5-points from 2022.
A variety of residential storage products challenge Tesla’s dominance
In 2023, Tesla maintained the #1 spot in the residential solar-plus-storage battery supplier rankings. With a 47% market share, the company commanded a compelling 30-point lead over second-ranked Enphase. Tesla looks to build on this lead in 2024 with its new Powerwall 3.
However, opportunities remain for long-tail suppliers to carve out market share. As a wider array of customers with different needs choose to adopt storage, installers can no longer take a one-size-fits-all approach. Some residential installers in California have stressed the need to have different batteries on hand. Battery sizes, AC and DC coupled configurations, whole home-integration capabilities, and other differentiating traits provide opportunities for specialized products to capture market share.
Nexamp, Summit Ridge Energy, and CS Energy top community solar rankings
It’s been a year since Wood Mackenize first added community solar rankings to the US PV Leaderboard. And, for the second consecutive year, Nexamp claims a spot among the top three national installers, with a first-place finish in 2023. Their 9.1% 2023 community solar market share represents a 5-point increase from 2022. Summit Ridge and CS Energy follow Nexamp in the rankings with 4.8% and 4.3% market share, respectively.
While many of the top installers are familiar companies, the community solar market holds much opportunity for new entrants. More than half of the top 75 installers in 2023 did not have any community solar installations in 2022, and 28 of the top 75 installers had their first community solar installation ever in 2023.
The opportunity for new entrants is especially exciting given the potential expansion of community solar to new state markets. We continue to track proposed legislation in Midwest states such as Ohio, Wisconsin, and Michigan, as well as Pennsylvania, where pre-development pipelines are currently upwards of 1 GWdc.
The community solar leaderboard is especially volatile because of varying interconnection timelines and project sizes. In 2023, interconnection queue delays in many mature markets held up installations. With our data based off interconnection dates, installers with strong pipelines may see uneven market shares or large quarter-over-quarter changes that do not reflect steady development work. This unevenness is furthered by the fact that community solar projects are large (average size was 1.8 MWdc in 2023) and one or two key installations can significantly change market rankings.
Additional key findings from the latest Leaderboard include:
- Enphase secured the top spot in the residential inverter supplier rankings with a market share of 54.7%. In 2023, the top five residential inverter suppliers represented 96% of the market.
- CS Energy, Nexamp, and PowerFlex topped the commercial solar installer rankings, securing a combined market share of 11.5%.
- In the commercial solar-plus-storage rankings, CS Energy, Agilitas Energy, and REC Solar (ArcLight) led with a combined market share of 37%.
- SMA maintained the #1 commercial inverter supplier ranking for the second consecutive year. Its market share rose from 22.4% in 2022 to 28.5% in 2023.

Tesla Lithium Refinery construction making progress
Tesla is making construction progress on its upcoming lithium refinery in Texas, as shown in photos taken by one drone pilot this week.
Longtime Tesla construction observer Joe Tegtmeyer shared photos of Tesla’s forthcoming lithium plant near Corpus Christi, Texas, on Monday. The photos, as posted on X, show the foundations of what will eventually be Production Line 1, with other superstructure work and the beginnings of construction on Production Line 2, as Tegtmeyer explains.
Construction on the lithium plant was well underway by August, though Tegtmeyer’s latest photos show that the site has come a long way since then. He also points out that a new electrical substation has appeared at the site, while the installation of Rotating Kiln and Cooler Set 1 equipment has mostly been completed.
While production was initially expected to begin in the first quarter of this year, ramping throughout the latter half of the year, it appears that the site still has some work to do before the plant becomes operational. As usual, Tegtmeyer plans to share a full video with more details about the construction progress on YouTube, and this story will be updated to include it upon release.
Tesla broke ground on the Robstown, Texas lithium refinery in May, after the company shared plans for the plant during its Investor Day event last March. The refinery is eventually expected to produce 50 GWh of battery-grade lithium per year.
Hiring at the Robstown plant has also been ramping up over the past several months, and at this time, Tesla has 40 open positions on its careers page. The page includes a wide array of positions, including roles such as an Area Superintendent, a Logistics Supervisor, several engineering jobs, a Senior Metallurgist, and a number of other managers, technicians, and specialists.
Tesla proposes $3.8 million donation for roads near lithium refinery

BREAKING: Tesla launches public Robotaxi rides in Austin with no Safety Monitor
Tesla has officially launched public Robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, without a Safety Monitor in the vehicle, marking the first time the company has removed anyone from the vehicle other than the rider.
The Safety Monitor has been present in Tesla Robotaxis in Austin since its launch last June, maintaining safety for passengers and other vehicles, and was placed in the passenger’s seat.
Tesla planned to remove the Safety Monitor at the end of 2025, but it was not quite ready to do so. Now, in January, riders are officially reporting that they are able to hail a ride from a Model Y Robotaxi without anyone in the vehicle:
I am in a robotaxi without safety monitor pic.twitter.com/fzHu385oIb
— TSLA99T (@Tsla99T) January 22, 2026
Tesla started testing this internally late last year and had several employees show that they were riding in the vehicle without anyone else there to intervene in case of an emergency.
Tesla has now expanded that program to the public. It is not active in the entire fleet, but there are a “few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors,” Ashok Elluswamy said:
Robotaxi rides without any safety monitors are now publicly available in Austin.
Starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time. https://t.co/ShMpZjefwB

Tesla Robotaxi goes driverless as Musk confirms Safety Monitor removal testing
The Robotaxi program also operates in the California Bay Area, where the fleet is much larger, but Safety Monitors are placed in the driver’s seat and utilize Full Self-Driving, so it is essentially the same as an Uber driver using a Tesla with FSD.
In Austin, the removal of Safety Monitors marks a substantial achievement for Tesla moving forward. Now that it has enough confidence to remove Safety Monitors from Robotaxis altogether, there are nearly unlimited options for the company in terms of expansion.
While it is hoping to launch the ride-hailing service in more cities across the U.S. this year, this is a much larger development than expansion, at least for now, as it is the first time it is performing driverless rides in Robotaxi anywhere in the world for the public to enjoy.
Investor's Corner
Tesla Earnings Call: Top 5 questions investors are asking
Tesla has scheduled its Earnings Call for Q4 and Full Year 2025 for next Wednesday, January 28, at 5:30 p.m. EST, and investors are already preparing to get some answers from executives regarding a wide variety of topics.
The company accepts several questions from retail investors through the platform Say, which then allows shareholders to vote on the best questions.
Tesla does not answer anything regarding future product releases, but they are willing to shed light on current timelines, progress of certain projects, and other plans.
There are five questions that range over a variety of topics, including SpaceX, Full Self-Driving, Robotaxi, and Optimus, which are currently in the lead to be asked and potentially answered by Elon Musk and other Tesla executives:
- You once said: Loyalty deserves loyalty. Will long-term Tesla shareholders still be prioritized if SpaceX does an IPO?
- Our Take – With a lot of speculation regarding an incoming SpaceX IPO, Tesla investors, especially long-term ones, should be able to benefit from an early opportunity to purchase shares. This has been discussed endlessly over the past year, and we must be getting close to it.
- When is FSD going to be 100% unsupervised?
- Our Take – Musk said today that this is essentially a solved problem, and it could be available in the U.S. by the end of this year.
- What is the current bottleneck to increase Robotaxi deployment & personal use unsupervised FSD? The safety/performance of the most recent models or people to monitor robots, robotaxis, in-car, or remotely? Or something else?
- Our Take – The bottleneck seems to be based on data, which Musk said Tesla needs 10 billion miles of data to achieve unsupervised FSD. Once that happens, regulatory issues will be what hold things up from moving forward.
- Regarding Optimus, could you share the current number of units deployed in Tesla factories and actively performing production tasks? What specific roles or operations are they handling, and how has their integration impacted factory efficiency or output?
- Our Take – Optimus is going to have a larger role in factories moving forward, and later this year, they will have larger responsibilities.
- Can you please tie purchased FSD to our owner accounts vs. locked to the car? This will help us enjoy it in any Tesla we drive/buy and reward us for hanging in so long, some of us since 2017.
- Our Take – This is a good one and should get us some additional information on the FSD transfer plans and Subscription-only model that Tesla will adopt soon.
Tesla will have its Earnings Call on Wednesday, January 28.

Elon Musk shares incredible detail about Tesla Cybercab efficiency
Elon Musk shared an incredible detail about Tesla Cybercab’s potential efficiency, as the company has hinted in the past that it could be one of the most affordable vehicles to operate from a per-mile basis.
ARK Invest released a report recently that shed some light on the potential incremental cost per mile of various Robotaxis that will be available on the market in the coming years.
The Cybercab, which is detailed for the year 2030, has an exceptionally low cost of operation, which is something Tesla revealed when it unveiled the vehicle a year and a half ago at the “We, Robot” event in Los Angeles.
Musk said on numerous occasions that Tesla plans to hit the $0.20 cents per mile mark with the Cybercab, describing a “clear path” to achieving that figure and emphasizing it is the “full considered” cost, which would include energy, maintenance, cleaning, depreciation, and insurance.
Probably true
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 22, 2026
ARK’s report showed that the Cybercab would be roughly half the cost of the Waymo 6th Gen Robotaxi in 2030, as that would come in at around $0.40 per mile all in. Cybercab, at scale, would be at $0.20.
This would be a dramatic decrease in the cost of operation for Tesla, and the savings would then be passed on to customers who choose to utilize the ride-sharing service for their own transportation needs.
The U.S. average cost of new vehicle ownership is about $0.77 per mile, according to AAA. Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft rideshares often cost between $1 and $4 per mile, while Waymo can cost between $0.60 and $1 or more per mile, according to some estimates.
Tesla’s engineering has been the true driver of these cost efficiencies, and its focus on creating a vehicle that is as cost-effective to operate as possible is truly going to pay off as the vehicle begins to scale. Tesla wants to get the Cybercab to about 5.5-6 miles per kWh, which has been discussed with prototypes.
Additionally, fewer parts due to the umboxed manufacturing process, a lower initial cost, and eliminating the need to pay humans for their labor would also contribute to a cheaper operational cost overall. While aspirational, all of the ingredients for this to be a real goal are there.
It may take some time as Tesla needs to hammer the manufacturing processes, and Musk has said there will be growing pains early. This week, he said regarding the early production efforts:
“…initial production is always very slow and follows an S-curve. The speed of production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are. For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast.”",https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-lithium-refinery-construction/

Porsche’s latest, hottest Taycan is only tenths slower than the McLaren Senna hypercar.On February 23, 2024, at 10:50 a.m. with Lars Kern behind the wheel, a new, hardcore variant of Porsche's all-electric sedan set the series-production electric-car lap record at California's Weathertech Raceway Laguna Seca by more than 2 seconds.
""He went faster!"" I shouted. None of the approximately four-dozen human beings—an equal mix of influencer/content-creator types and Porsche employees—standing behind me heard a word. They were all too consumed with a massive set of screens the company set up to show a live feed of Kern rocketing around the track in the brand-new 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT with Weissach package. A moment later the gathered crowd erupted in cheers. This was Kern's second go, and he'd already set the record 30 minutes earlier, handily beating the existing 1-minute, 30.3-second record held by Sebastian Vittel (no relation to Sebastian Vettel) in a Tesla Model S Plaid.
Kern had popped off a 1:28.26 in a Grimace purple Taycan Turbo GT Weissach, but the tires just weren't having it when he attempted a second lap. So he simply hopped into the car he'd set the Nürburgring Nordschleife production electric-car record in and wrote himself into the Laguna Seca record book yet again. Within minutes, almost all of the Porsche employees changed into purple T-shirts that read, ""Look How We Unscrewed the Corkscrew."" Let's assume it sounds better in German.
The What
This new Taycan variant will sit atop the Turbo S in the Taycan range when it arrives at U.S. dealerships this summer. The Taycan Turbo GT comes in two flavors, regular and the significantly modified track monster dubbed the Weissach package. Beginning with the Taycan Turbo GT, horsepower is way up compared to the S, with overboost raising it from 938 to 1,093. Regular power output rises from 764 to 1,019 hp. Torque also increases, from 818 to 988 lb-ft.
The Turbo GT still uses the original Taycan's layout, with just two motors versus the three-motor setups found in the Tesla Model X Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire. The Taycan Turbo GTs also retain the two-speed transmission connected only to the rear motor. Visually, though, you can easily tell the Weissach package from the ""normal"" Turbo GT by the big wing stuck on the former's rump. It increases downforce by 303 pounds in the rear, according to the manufacturer. Meanwhile, aeroblades and a front splitter produce another 176 pounds of downward pressure on the nose.
A Big Boy
I spoke to Kern immediately after he climbed out of the purple car. On his first record-setting lap of 1:28.26, he said he made some small errors that cost him some tenths. He then tried to correct himself on lap two, but the tires were shot. Remember, even with as much weight reduction as Porsche could manage—the 5,038 pounds for the Turbo GT drops to 4,884 pounds for the Weissach package, though it gained 44 pounds with race seats and a rollcage added for safety, so 4,928 sans driver—the Turbo GT is still a heavy machine for a racetrack.
Porsche felt the best strategy was to run a hot lap, a cool down lap, and then a second hot lap. However, that effectively put the tires through a complete heat cycle and ruined their ultimate pace. Some of you might think, hey, Laguna Seca is 2.2 miles long, and the Nürburgring is nearly 13 miles in length, why not just perform two hot laps in a row? Because the new Taycan Turbo GT would have gone even quicker on the 'Ring had its Pirelli P Zero R tires held up better.
Happy it had smashed Tesla's time but still wanting more, Porsche put Kern into the black and blue car for one more attempt. An employee let slip that the Model S Plaid was never the real target.
No, the number the Taycan team was after was one that we, MotorTrend , set previously. Back during our Best Driver's Car days, pro racer Randy Pobst put down a scorching 1:28.3 in a 2018 Porsche GT2 RS. But the Taycan team had ""mathed"" it out and believed the Turbo GT Weissach could put a hurt on that time, and maybe even approach the McLaren Senna hypercar's lap of 1:27.62.
More important, Kern liked the way the black and blue car drove better than the purple version, even though the day before he'd been quicker while practicing in the latter. Porsche also brought living racing legend Timo Bernhard along (watch his 919 Hybrid Evo record lap around the Nürburgring!) to advise, and he said Kern was too calm during practice—his heartrate hadn't crested 100 beats per minute. Yes, Porsche had him hooked up to a heart rate monitor, and on the real run we saw Kern's heart pumping at 165 bpm. So Bernhard felt confident that the driver was giving it his all.
I've spent countless hours timing laps while standing against the K-Wall just after Laguna's Turn 11, the corner that leads back onto the track's kinked main straight. So even though Porsche had gone whole hog with the livestream video setup, I opted to hand-time the runs instead of watching the live feed. That's how I was aware Kern and the 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT Weissach reset the lap record about an eighth of a mile before everyone else. The official time: 1:27.87.
That's a mere 0.2 second difference between a 5,000-pound electric sedan and one of the quickest production car (of any ilk) laps ever recorded at Laguna Seca, by a McLaren Senna—a veritable carbon-fiber track toy that weighs about a full ton less. To use the most clichéd phrase of our time, I'm shocked. Good work, Porsche. Lucid, whatcha got?

When I was just one-year-old and newly walking, I managed to paint a white racing stripe down the side of my father’s Datsun 280Z. It’s been downhill ever since then. Moral of the story? Painting the garage leads to petrolheads. I’ve always loved writing, and I’ve always had strong opinions about cars. One day I realized that I should combine two of my biggest passions and see what happened. Turns out that some people liked what I had to say and within a few years Angus MacKenzie came calling. I regularly come to the realization that I have the best job in the entire world. My father is the one most responsible for my car obsession. While driving, he would never fail to regale me with tales of my grandfather’s 1950 Cadillac 60 Special and 1953 Buick Roadmaster. He’d also try to impart driving wisdom, explaining how the younger you learn to drive, the safer driver you’ll be. “I learned to drive when I was 12 and I’ve never been in an accident.” He also, at least once per month warned, “No matter how good you drive, someday, somewhere, a drunk’s going to come out of nowhere and plow into you.” When I was very young my dad would strap my car seat into the front of his Datsun 280Z and we’d go flying around the hills above Malibu, near where I grew up. The same roads, in fact, that we now use for the majority of our comparison tests. I believe these weekend runs are part of the reason why I’ve never developed motion sickness, a trait that comes in handy when my “job” requires me to sit in the passenger seats for repeated hot laps of the Nurburgring. Outside of cars and writing, my great passions include beer — brewing and judging as well as tasting — and tournament poker. I also like collecting cactus, because they’re tough to kill. My amazing wife Amy is an actress here in Los Angeles and we have a wonderful son, Richard.

With over 1,000 hp and a 0 to 60 mph in 2.1 seconds, it is the fastest, most powerful road-legal Porsche of all time.
Porsche has been on a roll the past few months as it expands its all-electric lineup. After revealing the fully electric Macan in January, its first established model converted to an EV, Porsche followed it up with an upgraded Taycan last month.
The new Taycan is better in every way, with more range, faster charging, and added performance. “We are continuing this success story with the extensively updated Taycan,” head of the line, Kevin Giek, said.
Porsche included a bigger battery (105 kWh), new thermal management, and a heat pump to improve efficiency.
The new 2025 Taycan reaches “new heights in performance” with all trims quicker than their predecessors.
Porsche added features like a new push-to-pass function that boosts power by up to 70 kW (for ten seconds) at the push of a button. With up to 938 hp for a 0 to 60 mph sprint in 4.5 seconds, the new Taycan Turbo is Porsche’s most powerful road-legal car yet. That is until Porsche revealed the Taycan Turbo GT on Monday.
Meet the Porsche Taycan Turbo GT
Porsche teased the powerful Taycan Turbo GT several times leading up to its official debut Monday.
A pre-series model driven by Lars Kern lapped the Nurburgring in 7:07:55. That’s 26 seconds faster than the Porsche Taycan Turbo S Sport and 18 seconds ahead of the Tesla Model S Plaid (with track package) record of 7:25:31.
Porsche revealed the new model with Weissach Package after earning the fastest electric series production car title at the Weathertech Raceway Laguna Seca in California.
With a lap time of 1:27:87, Kern set another record. “To prove your mettle on the track, it’s not enough to simply have as much power as possible. The overall package of accelerating and braking, cornering grip, aerodynamics, stability and fine-tuning has to be right,” Giek explained.
He added that Porsche’s engineers have already done a great job with the updated Taycan, but “our new GT cars yet again clearly raise the bar even higher in terms of driving dynamics and enjoyment.”
Taking on Tesla
Porsche’s new high-performance EV beat the previous record of 1:30:30 set by a Tesla Model S Plaid in 2020.
| Horsepower | 0 to 60 mph (seconds) | Starting Price | |
| Porsche Taycan Turbo GT (with Weissach Package) | 1,092 | 2.1 | $230,000 |
| Tesla Model S Plaid | 1,020 | 1.99 | $89,990 |
Although other electric vehicles have lapped the track quicker, they were all modified. With up to 1,092 hp (with Weissach Package), the new Porsche tops the Tesla Model S Plaid at 1,020 hp.
Tesla says the Model S Plaid can go from 0 to 60 mph in 1.99 seconds (with rollout subtracted). That would top Porsche’s claimed 2.1 seconds.
Porsche and Tesla have been going back and forth on the fastest electric production car title since the Taycan won it in 2019.
Top comment by John Donovan
I’m just fine with my Model S Long Range with a 0 to 60 in 3.1 sec. The Plaid is amazing but I prefer the 400+ mile range of the LR!
At first glance, the high-performance EV looks like a sporty Taycan. The model features a front spoiler with aeroblades and an adaptive rear spoiler. It also includes more of a “racing vibe” than the Turbo and Turbo S models.
The Weissach Package eliminates all non-track driving equipment like the rear seats to save 157 lbs compared to the Taycan Turbo S.
Porsche’s new Taycan Turbo GT and Turbo GT with Weissach Package are now available to order. The first models are expected to hit US dealers this summer.

Angela Chao reportedly phoned her friends for help before her car was submerged in pond on Texas ranch
The late sister-in-law of Mitch McConnell drowned after accidentally reversing her Tesla Model X into a pond at her Texas ranch,
Angela Chao, 50, reportedly called a friend in a panic before her car was “completely submerged” in the pond on the sprawling ranch outside of Austin.
The death of Chao, the chair and chief executive of the Chao family business, the Foremost Group shipping company, was reported last month, but details about the fatal accident were slow to emerge.
Chao’s may have been caused by her putting the electric vehicle into reverse causing it to slam into the pond and sink, with first responders unable to get it out in time to save her life, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The outlet spoke to friends of Chao, her family and county officials who were at the scene or briefed on the incident, as well as reviewing law enforcement documents to establish the course of events that led to her death.
Chao had invited friends from Harvard Business School to the 900-acre ranch outside of Austin, Texas to spend a weekend with her, stated the report.
At around 11.30pm on 10 February, after spending time with her friends in the guest house, she went to head back to the ranch’s main house in a Tesla Model X SUV.
Minutes later Chao called one of her friends “in a panic”, the outlet reported. During a three-point turn, she put her car into reverse instead of into drive. As the vehicle went backwards, it tipped over an embankment and into a pond.
After the alarm was raised, Chao’s friends, the ranch manager, first responders, and sheriff’s deputies tried to break the vehicle’s windows or find an escape hatch. One of her friends even jumped into the pond, the outlet reported.
An emergency unit for Blanco County arrived around 24 minutes after getting a call, the fire department incident report said, per the Wall Street Journal.
Some first responders had got out of their vehicles and walked to the scene due to “the terrain and accessibility.”
In the attempts to rescue Chao from her vehicle in the pond, one responder recalled the Tesla as being completely submerged, with deputies standing on it as they tried to save the businesswoman.
As a dive team was not available, an emergency service worker and a firefighter entered the water with rescue tools. A tow truck turned up, but with a cable too short to retrieve the vehicle; eventually, responders found a longer cable.
The outlet said that once the car was out of the water and the doors were opened, hundreds of gallons of water rushed out.
Chao was unresponsive when the car resurfaced, and attempts were made to resuscitate her, but this was unsuccessful. She was deceased at the scene.
A person familiar with the situation told the Wall Street Journal that no one in the family blames Tesla.
The Blanco Sheriff’s Office told NBC in a statement on 16 February that emergency measures were taken, but Chao “succumbed from being under the water.”
“Our preliminary investigation has determined this to be an unfortunate accident. The investigation is ongoing at this time,” the statement said.
However, the sheriff’s office then reportedly wrote in a letter to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on 29 February, according to NBC, that it was “not a typical accident” and that the office is investigating it as a “criminal matter until they have sufficient evidence to rule out criminal activity.”
Chao was the sister of Elaine Chao, who served as secretary of transportation under Donald Trump and is also married to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.
Weeks after Chao’s death, Mr McConnell announced on the Senate floor that he would step down from his leadership position, bringing an end to his position as the US Senate’s longest-serving party leader.
His senate term expires in 2027, and he plans to remain in Congress until then.
“As some of you may know, this has been a particularly difficult time for my family,"" Mr McConnell said in his announcement on 28 February, speaking of his sister-in-law.
""When you lose a loved one, particularly at a young age, there is a certain introspection that accompanies the grieving process. Perhaps it is God’s way of reminding you of your own life’s journey to reprioritise the impact on the world that we will all inevitably leave behind,"" he added.

Over the years, there have been a handful of fatal crashes involving Tesla’s Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) features, more commonly referred to as their brand names: Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) Package.
The families of the victims have taken the accidents to trials for wrongful death at times, but Tesla always won.
That’s because, in virtually all cases, Tesla was able to show that the driver was not paying attention at the moment of the accident or leading up to it. When using Autopilot or FSD Beta, Tesla tells drivers that they need to pay attention at all times and to be ready to take control at all times.
If drivers are not doing that, they are misusing the system.
However, some have argued that Tesla should take more responsibility for creating an exaggerated level of confidence in its ADAS systems and to limit the misuse by better ensuring that drivers are paying attention.
Now, a new trial is about to take place, and the lawyers of the family of the deceased Tesla driver have uncovered evidence that they claim shows Tesla knew it was too easy to abuse Autopilot.
The trial is about one of the most publicized Tesla Autopilot accidents. We reported on it extensively when it first happened and in follow-ups regarding several investigations of the crash.
The Tesla Autopilot Crash
The crash occurred in March 2018 and involved Apple engineer Walter Huang.
Huang was driving his Model X on Autopilot when it entered the median of a ramp on the highway as if it were a lane, a common problem with Tesla’s Autopilot at the time. About 150 meters after entering the median, it hit a barrier.
The impact was quite severe because there was no crash attenuator since it was already destroyed by a previous crash. The driver was rushed to the hospital, but he died of his injuries.
NHTSA investigated the accident and confirmed that the vehicle was using Autopilot at the time of the crash. However, according to phone data, it blamed the driver, who was playing a video game on his phone, and the lack of a crash attenuator, which affected the severity of the crash.
The Trial
The family has sued Tesla for wrongful death, and it is going to be quite an uphill battle for them because it looks like he was using his phone while driving, which is a traffic violation and against Tesla’s guidance on how to use Autopilot.
That said, the family’s lawyers benefit from learning from previous similar trials and they are taking a different approach. They are not denying Huang’s misuse of Autopilot, but they are focusing on Tesla’s communications, which they claim led to the driver misusing Autopilot.
As we previously reported, as part of the discovery process for the trial, the family’s lawyers have focused on several statements made by Tesla, and specifically Elon Musk, about Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving efforts that could lead drivers to be overconfident in the systems.
In its defense, Tesla went as far as bizarrely claiming that some of Musk’s comments on the matter might have been deep fakes without specifying which ones.
The trial is now set to start next week in a San Jose court and more pieces of evidences are coming out as the court determines what they will be able to show to the jury.
Reuters report on an email that Jon McNeil, then Tesla’s president, sent to CEO Elon Musk and Sterling Anderson, Tesla’s head of Autopilot at the time, in which McNeil admitted to reading emails while using Autopilot:
“I got so comfortable under Autopilot, that I ended up blowing by exits because I was immersed in emails or calls (I know, I know, not a recommended use),.”
The lawyers are also arguing that Tesla never never “studied how quickly and effectively drivers could take control if Autopilot accidentally steers towards an obsacle,” based on Tesla witnesses and experts.
It sounds like the trial is going to revolve around what Tesla communicated to owners and what it has done internally to ensure owners use its systems safely.
But it will also focus on the fact that after the accident, Tesla has taken more steps to ensure driver attention, including introducing driver monitoring through its cabin-facing camera and more recently, it even had a recall to increase driver alerts to pay more attention when using Autopilot and FSD Beta.
The fact that Tesla had a recall recently over the issue could play a big role in this trial as it wasn’t the case in the previous ones won by the automaker.
Electrek’s Take
When cases involve a death, it’s always a sensitive matter, and the Tesla community is quick to put all the blame on the drivers.
That’s especially easy to do when the driver was using his phone at the moment of the crash, which is not legal, and he had seemingly more than a few seconds to react when the Autopilot made a mistake and went into the median.
That said, I think it is reasonable to explore, at least, the possibility that Tesla has contributed to the misuse of its own ADAS system.
Top comment by Timthenchntr
Seems like this is the weakest case of the several I have read about. The driver in this case was a California software engineer, someone who presumably had a good understanding of both software capabilities and Silicon Valley culture of communication. The driver was experienced with the car and had noted to friends, family and to Tesla that is was not reliable all the time. In particular, he had complained about the exact exit ramp where he had a catastrophic accident.
Fatal accidents are terrible things, but it seems to me that this is a very weak case.
We can’t deny that misuse was, and maybe still is, fairly common among Tesla owners at the time of this crash. We even reported on Elon Musk’s own wife at the time posting videos of her misusing Autopilot on her Instagram.
Now, on a legal basis, I don’t know how valuable this argument is, but it sounds like some experts think there’s a case.
Matthew Wansley, a Cardozo law school associate professor, agrees that Tesla had an obligation to prevent “foreseeable misuse”:
“If it was reasonably foreseeable to Tesla that someone would misuse the system, Tesla had an obligation to design the system in a way that prevented foreseeable misuse.”
Either way, I think it can’t hurt to debate the issue, especially if it helps publicize the fact that Tesla drivers need to pay attention at all times when using Tesla’s ADAS systems.

The news agency Reuters first reported on the talks, citing government sources. According to the article, Kia could set up a factory for electric cars in Thailand. However, the carmaker is apparently looking for incentives in return. However, neither Kia nor the Thailand Board of Investment (BOI) would comment on the current status of the talks when asked by Reuters. However, the BOI had already stated in January that Kia was considering an investment in Thailand.
“They have a serious proposal that they’ve come with,” Reuters quotes one of its sources regarding Kia. “The ball is in their court.”
Kia is seemingly not the only carmaker interested in producing in the Southeast Asian country. The Thai government is also talking to Tesla about a possible electric car and battery production facility. According to the news agency, the US carmaker already conducted a site survey last year. This was also confirmed by an official from the prime minister’s office.
Although no specific locations are mentioned in the article, the Thai government is said to have offered Tesla the opportunity to supply the plant with 100 per cent green electricity. It is not known in either case when a concrete investment decision could be made – or how much could be invested.
Tesla has been looking to set up shop in the region. There have been rumours that the US manufacturer is looking to build a factory for its electric cars as well as for batteries in India. However, while there have been reports citing insiders, the information has yet to be officially confirmed.
About 2.5 million vehicles are produced in Thailand every year. The Thai government is pursuing the “30@30” target, according to which at least 30 per cent of local production should be accounted for by zero-emission vehicles by 2030. Thailand is geographically well-positioned to serve Asian markets, has nickel resources, and can process Indonesian nickel.
Numerous companies from the car and battery industry have already been lured with subsidies. At the beginning of March, BMW broke ground for a new production facility for high-voltage batteries at its Rayong plant to build a purely electric model in addition to combustion engines and plug-in hybrids. In addition, many companies from China have also decided to invest there due to Thailand’s subsidy policy. These include the SAIC brand MG, GAC Aion, Neta and Great Wall on the vehicle side and SVOLT, Gotion High-Tech and Eve Energy on the battery side.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, the late Angela Chao, who was CEO of the Chinese shipping firm Foremost Group and the youngest sister of Sen. Mitch McConnell’s wife Elaine, experienced a harrowing demise that her friends witnessed as her Tesla Model X SUV sunk slowly into a small stock pond.
The unfortunate incident occurred in February’s Lunar New Year, the report noted, when the 50-year-old Chao and a bevy of her female friends were enjoying a lavish retreat at her Texas ranch. Because it had been a cold and dark night in the Austin area, the shipping magnate decided to make the short drive from her property’s guest house to her main home when she accidentally put the car in reverse instead of drive — a mistake she’d made before, apparently.
Almost immediately upon making that ill-fated miscalculation, Chao called her friends who were just steps away, asking them if they could help her as her car began swiftly to sink. One jumped into the pond to try to save her friend. Ultimately, despite calling paramedics and other emergency officials, it took hours to get the car, with the CEO in it, out of the pond.
According to experts, you have roughly 30-60 seconds to safely get out of a car when it starts sinking. With automatic windows like those used by Tesla and most other vehicle manufacturers, there are only a few seconds to push the button and roll down the windows before the water gets too high. After that, the only way to get out is to break the glass — and because Tesla uses laminated glass, one of the most durable types on the market, breaking it under the pressure of water would have been nearly impossible.
Because it took hours to retrieve both the car from the water and Chao from the vehicle, she was ruled dead on arrival and no autopsy was performed, the WSJ reported. Despite the circumstances, however, law enforcement in Blanco County where the CEO lived with her husband, venture capitalist Jim Breyer, are still investigating her death as a criminal matter.
As such, conspiracy theories have cropped up in the long month since Chao’s death, including some who claim that there could have been foul play based on her status as CEO of a shipping conglomerate — especially from alleged bad actors in China, where her parents were from.
“Does the Blanco County Sheriff have the technical capacity to investigate the Tesla Logs to determine if the car was tampered with or even hacked?” Texas-based hedge fund manager and apparent China-hater Kyle Bass tweeted on March 1. “This case continues to become more and more suspicious.”
Despite the conspiratorial attention, which has per the WSJ chagrined Chao’s grieving family, it appears almost certain that her death was a tragic accident — and given that researchers say more than 400 people in North America die in vehicle submersions per year, it’s definitely not without precedent.

A first-ever safety assessment of partial automated driving systems by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety gave “poor” safety ratings to several big name automation systems, including Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving functions—adding fresh safety concerns as automated features continue to roll out on highways.
Key Facts
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated 14 partial driving automation features and gave 11 of them “poor” ratings, covering features from BMW, Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Tesla and Volvo.
None of the automation systems received the highest possible rating of “good”—the Lexus LS Teammate system was rated the best with “acceptable” and the GMC Sierra and Nissan Ariya both offered partial automation systems rated “marginal.”
The rating system assesses many features related to driver involvement and attention when the automation is engaged, with the IIHS arguing while often billed as “self-driving,” these automation systems still require human engagement.
Tesla’s Autopilot received a good safety rating for its lane change feature—the IIHS checks to make sure that automated lane changes are either initiated or confirmed by the driver—but it received poor ratings for its driver monitoring features, its attention reminders and its lane centering assist function, which the IIHS says should not “discourage steering by driver.”
The Tesla Full Self-Driving feature received an acceptable rating for its attention reminders, but had poor ratings for its driver monitoring, lange change function and lane centering function.
Forbes has contacted Tesla for comment.
Contra
The IIHS acknowledged some automakers have already begun to make adjustments to their system. The evaluation looked at Tesla’s automation prior to the December 2023 recall, when nearly every Tesla in the U.S. was upgraded after regulators found the Autopilot feature failed to adequately detect if the driver was paying attention. Tesla has repeatedly insisted its self-driving system is safe, citing data that suggests Autopilot is 10 times safer than the U.S. average and 5 times safer than a Tesla with no Autopilot. The company has maintained that drivers are still responsible for operation of the vehicle, even with automation turned on.
Key Background
Tesla’s self-driving features have faced some scrutiny over safety in recent years. Last February, the company recalled and issued software updates for nearly 400,000 vehicles due to concerns its Full Self-Driving system could cause crashes, and the December recall prompted by the Autopilot flaw covered more than 2 million vehicles. Meanwhile, General Motors has slowed its self-driving car unit Cruise amid safety concerns about its automated taxis.
Big Number
40. That’s how many fatal or serious crashes involving Tesla’s automated driving system the Washington Post identified between 2016 and the December recall, though Tesla has said the anecdotes cited by the Post don’t reflect the full picture of Tesla’s safety features.",https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/03/12/self-driving-programs-including-teslas-get-poor-ratings-from-safety-group/

These systems combine different sensors and technologies to help a driver keep their vehicle in its lane and avoid hitting other vehicles in front and to the sides. Usually, these systems work only on highways. Some can even allow drivers to remove their hands from the steering wheel but all require drivers to pay attention to the road and vehicles around them at all times.
Of the 14 systems tested by the agency, 11 earned a “poor” rating including Tesla’s Autopilot and so-called Full Self Driving systems. (Full Self Driving is not actually fully self driving but, unlike Autopilot and almost all other such systems, it is designed to work on city and suburban streets.)
The organization also rated hands-free highway driving systems from Ford and Nissan as “poor.” General Motors’ hands-free system, Super Cruise, was rated as “marginal.” Only Lexus’s Teammate with Advanced Drive system received a rating of “acceptable.” Even that rating, though, is still one step below the Insurance Institute’s highest possible rating of good.
“Some drivers may feel that partial automation makes long drives easier, but there is little evidence it makes driving safer,” Insurance Institute president David Harkey said in a statement. “As many high-profile crashes have illustrated, it can introduce new risks when systems lack appropriate safeguards.”
The federal government’s National Highway Traffic Safety Administration doesn’t currently regulate these sorts of systems. That’s one reason the IIHS instituted these ratings, Harkey said in an interview with CNN.
“We felt like this is an appropriate time for us to step into the space, fill this regulatory gap we’re talking about, help drive automakers to produce safer implementations within their vehicles and also help consumers understand what these systems actually are and what the differences are between some of these systems,” Harkey said.
Many of the systems received demerits for not doing enough to make sure drivers stayed attentive and undistracted as the car steered, braked and accelerated on its own. The Insurance Institute said none of the 14 systems it tested do a good job monitoring driver attention.
In vehicles where an interior camera monitors driver attention, the Institute tested what happened if that camera is deliberately blocked or if the driver turns their gaze away from the road for too long. Some systems also — or only — monitor whether the driver is holding the steering wheel, so testers looked at what happened if a driver let go of the steering wheel for too long.
With systems such as GM’s Super Cruise and Nissan ProPilot Assist that allow drivers to remove their hands from the steering for long periods, testers also held a block resembling a cellphone. This tested whether the system could detect the driver’s hands were not ready to grab the steering wheel in an emergency.
“We are evaluating the results from the first-ever Partial Automation Safeguards test and will continue to work with IIHS in all matters related to customer safety,” Nissan said in a statement emailed to CNN.
The Institute also checked how these systems alerted an inattentive driver to pay attention. Seven of the systems, it found, didn’t provide two-method alerts — such as a blinking light and a sound or steering wheel vibrations and lights — within 15 seconds of the driver becoming inattentive.
Insurance Institute test drivers also looked at what would happen if the driver became incapacitated with the automated driving system in use. This is a real concern because the car could just keep driving at high speed with no one actually in control. If a driver doesn’t start paying attention for as long as 35 seconds after having been warned to, the vehicle should begin an emergency slow down and, also, contact emergency services on its own, according to the Insurance Institute. Of the systems tested, only GM’s Super Cruise handled that sort of situation the proper way, according to the Institute.
Some automakers actually market adaptive driving features the Institute feels are unsafe. For instance, the Tesla and GM systems can perform lane changes entirely on their own without asking whether the driver wants to change lanes. They can be set to do this if another lane seems faster than the one the vehicle is currently in. That’s not safe, Harkey said in an interview with CNN, because it further invites drivers to disengage from driving. Drivers should at least be prompted to allow a lane change even if the car can handle the maneuver on its own, he said.
“As new vehicles increasingly come equipped with more advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), efforts like the partial automation ratings report by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) are important for more robust and unified safeguards,” GM said in a statement emailed to CNN. “We are judicious about safely expanding access to our industry-first hands-free system, Super Cruise, which is meant to serve as an enhancement to the driving experience.”
Since these ADAS systems are not safety features, it shouldn’t be possible to use them when actual safety features are disabled or not used, the Insurance Institute said. For instance, if seat belts are unbuckled or if automatic emergency braking is turned off, the systems should be disabled. Only a few of the systems met that criteria, the group said.
Ford noted that its vehicles have a system that reminds drivers to buckle their seat belts and that, according to its own data, vehicles using BlueCruise are 10 times less likely to swerve out of their lane, according to a statement from the automaker.
“We have been working closely with IIHS since BlueCruise was introduced in 2021,” Ford said in an email to CNN. “While we do not agree with IIHS’s findings, we will take their feedback into consideration as we continue to evaluate future updates.”
The Tesla Autopilot system was tested by the Insurance Institute before a December, 2023 recall in which a software update improved driver attention alerts. The Insurance Institute will continue to monitor software updates and improvements and will periodically retest the systems, Harkey said.

It could give us a hint as to how Cybertruck deliveries are going.
Tesla first started delivering Cybertrucks in November of last year, more than three months ago today. First deliveries were of the limited-edition “Foundation series”, which costs a $20k premium for what seems to be some slight trim differences and the privilege of having early delivery. So far, virtually all confirmed Cybertruck orders have been of the Foundation Series (and most in CA and TX), according to the order tracking list on Cybertruck Owner’s Club.
But now Tesla is adding another method for Cybertruck reservation holders to jump in front of the line – or perhaps an incentive to enhance the seeming exclusivity of the model.
Tesla’s website now has a page where shareholders can register for early delivery, as long as they meet these eligibility requirements:
- The Cybertruck reservation must be in the participant’s name and have been made prior to March 1st, 2024
- The participant has not yet taken delivery of a Cybertruck
- Each participant must provide brokerage statements showing that you owned TSLA shares on Feb. 28, 2021 and owned at least 500 TSLA shares on Feb. 29, 2024
- The brokerage statements for Feb. 29, 2024 must show that you owned at least 50% of the TSLA shares that you owned on Feb. 28, 2021
- Brokerage statements proving shareholdings must clearly show first/last name, statement date, and Tesla shares. All other information may be redacted.
These steps must be taken by Friday, March 22, 2024 11:59 PM CT CDT in order to hop the line, and can only be done once per customer and only in the US or Canada (where it’s coming soon).
As a result, even if a shareholder reserved a Cybertruck after initial deliveries began, they could still hop to the front of the Cybertruck line as long as they’ve held a significant amount of shares for some time.
This isn’t the first time Tesla has given special treatment to shareholders, specifically on something Cybertruck-related. A month before the Cybertruck delivery event, Tesla offered TSLA shareholders entries into a lottery for tickets to attend the event.
The company also recently offered accelerated delivery with referral credits, also for Foundation Series trucks, with a referral reward that sold out within hours.
If you fit the criteria and want to register for early delivery, head over to Tesla’s registration page here.
Electrek’s Take
Could this move also give us a sense of how Cybertruck deliveries are going?
Originally it was rumored that the Foundation Series would encompass only the first 1,000 vehicles. Later, rumors said that this number expanded to 20-25k. The company has not confirmed how many Foundation Series Cybertrucks will be made (which…would certainly be relevant information for collectors to know before spending a $20k premium).
Tesla has claimed that it currently has annual production capacity to produce 125,000 Cybertrucks per year – a number that wasn’t all that believable from the get-go. So, a quarter of a year into production, this would mean that Tesla should have been able to make 30,000+ Cybertrucks by now.
But if the company is just starting to offer early delivery to shareholders, either this means they’re going to produce tens of thousands of Foundation Series trucks, or they’re nowhere near 125,000 production capacity. We’re going to guess it’s the latter.
This move could also signal that the take-rate for Foundation Series invites has been disappointing. Customers may be waiting so they can avoid the $20k premium (they did reserve a $40k truck, after all, so $120k could certainly inspire sticker shock), or may be waiting until early production snags get ironed out. Even reports of a Cybertruck selling for $244k might not entice would-be flippers, given that Tesla has threatened and then followed through on punishing early owners who resell their trucks for profit.
Top comment by lean guy
I think this is simply an effort to get CTs to ""friendly"" buyers while they work thru manufacturability & quality issues. If you are a long term stockholder they are hypothesizing you to be sympathetic to Tesla and less likely to make ""noise"" - design issues, manufacturing issues, service center issues, etc. As far as the size of the Foundation Series - every launch Tesla has done shows they will ride a cash cow as far as they can. The size of the Foundation series will be defined by it's marketability, not some vague commitment to early buyers of exclusivity.
Regardless, we might have expected Foundation Series to be done delivering by now, given that the truck has been out for months already, and given that these invites just went out today which means there are at least several more weeks of Foundation Series deliveries left to go (current order confirmations seem to be getting a March-May delivery timeline).
This is simultaneously a quicker and slower pace than previous Tesla rollouts. For the Model 3, Tesla’s first deliveries started in July of 2017, but those cars only went out to employees and the first big wave of deliveries to the general public only started in late December (that’s when we got ours).
Meanwhile, for the Tesla Semi, those seem to have seen effectively no deliveries since the first trucks were released in December 2022. We still haven’t seen any reports of Semis owned by anyone other than Pepsi or Frito-Lay, though Tesla said in October that about 70 trucks have been built – about double the amount we know are owned by PepsiCo.
But with Cybertruck, members of the general public did start receiving trucks within weeks of the delivery event – which is quicker than both of the above. Though months later, it seems like the delivery numbers may still be coming in a trickle, rather than a flood.

According to experts, it will take Tesla less than a day to restart production at the plant. The German Handelsblatt writes that everything should be back up and running by Wednesday. The carmaker initially said that production would have to be suspended until the end of this week.
The power came back on Monday night at around 9:30 p.m. local time after an arson attack on a nearby electricity pole last week caused a blackout in the company and surrounding municipalities. You can read our detailed overview here. Energy supplier Edis has been working in three-shifts over the past few days to reconnect Tesla to the grid.
The carmaker initially assumed that it would suffer financial losses in the nine-digit range because of the attack. However, the blackout will cost Tesla about 400 million euros, so about half of what was expected. According to the Handelblatt, plant manager Andre Thierig had calculated with a much longer production stop.
The figure is calculated by considering that Tesla manufactures around 6,000 cars in Grünheide every week. If one only uses the base price for a Model Y of approximately 45,000 euros as a benchmark, Tesla lost 270 million euros in sales in one week. The disruption to the supply chain also results in additional costs. According to a report by Manager Magazin, trucks were already queuing outside the factory at the end of last week.
In the meantime, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office – the highest criminal prosecution authority in Germany – has taken over the case. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that there was initial suspicion that a terrorist organisation was involved. Initially, the public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt (Oder) took over the investigation into anti-constitutional sabotage, disruption of public businesses and arson.
Resistance to expansion plans
Since Thursday, environmental activists have occupied part of the forest, which will be cleared if the plant area is expanded. It has been clear for at least three weeks that Tesla is facing resistance to the plans to expand its factory. In mid-February, the citizens of Grünheide rejected an expansion of the factory site by a majority vote.
Tesla wants to build a freight depot, warehouses and a company daycare centre on an additional 170 hectares alongside the existing 300-hectare factory site. The plans were made public in 2022. The referendum focussed on these new areas, but Tesla also wants to expand the plant on the existing factory site. However, the latter was explicitly not put to the vote.
In February, precisely what would happen after the vote was still unclear. According to media reports, the vote is not legally binding. Still, Grünheide’s mayor, Arne Christiani, said that the rejected development plan would no longer be presented to the municipal representatives in its current form. City representatives will again meet on 14 March and 16 May. In addition, the state parliament’s finance committee would have to approve the sale of the land by Brandenburg’s state forestry organisation.
As reported, Tesla wants to double its production capacity in Grünheide from 500,000 units to one million EVs per year and, according to Brandenburg’s Ministry of the Environment, is also planning to “increase battery storage production capacity from the current 50 to 100 gigawatt-hours per year in the future.” The latter also includes the production of battery cells.
Update 13 March 2024
After just over a week, the Tesla plant in Grünheide, Brandenburg, is back up and running. This was reported to rbb this morning by the head of the works council. “The machines have been checked and safely started up so that the early shift can start again,” she said verbatim.

The March 3 crash happened just before midnight at the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and North Beverly Drive.
The nearly 7,000-pound stainless steel vehicle hopped the curb and came to a stop with its two front wheels on top of a concrete landscaping wall. The truck sustained major damage to its front end, as well as damaging the poles that hold the hotel’s sign.
Officers from the Beverly Hills Police Department and medical personnel with the fire department responded to the scene.
Three passengers inside the Cybertruck were examined for injuries, though no one was taken to the hospital for further treatment.
After photos of the crash went viral on X, formerly Twitter, Elon Musk, who owns the social media platform and is the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, commented on the accident.
“Cyberbeast is faster than a Porsche 911, but looks like a truck, so perhaps the valet wasn’t expecting so much acceleration,” he said, alluding to early reports that a valet crashed the truck, which turned out to be untrue.
“Upon investigation, it was determined that unsafe speed was a contributing factor to the cause of the accident,” BHPD said in a news release on Tuesday. “The Beverly Hills Police Department reminds all motorists to exercise caution and adhere to speed limits, especially when navigating turns and entering private properties.”",https://ktla.com/news/local-news/speed-a-factor-in-tesla-cybertruck-crash-into-beverly-hills-hotel-police/

The 7,142 square-foot estate comes complete with a Tesla Cybertruck. The property is located in Clear Creek Tahoe, a 2,136-acre private golf and lifestyle community minutes from Lake Tahoe.
“The home’s design embraces Tesla’s cutting-edge technology and the community’s mission to be stewards of the land,” said Mike Dunn, Listing Agent with Chase International. “We are proud to represent a new era of sustainable luxury living in one of the West’s most prestigious resort communities.”
Whisper Homes is developing the residence. They describe the home as a “true masterpiece of modern living and environmental sustainability.”
JKE Architects, Realm Construction and Saint Pierre Interiors have been contracted for this unprecedented project.
It is one of the very few homes in the Silver State that includes Tesla’s Solar Roof, Tesla Power Walls, and a fully integrated solar and energy storage system, including generators and a battery backup system. Depending on the situation, the power walls have a “gateway” that essentially acts as a switch and allows for remote control of power distribution to required circuits when the grid is down.
The Tesla app also lets the homeowner take the home off-grid whenever desired. The application can be used to operate the home on solar and battery when power rates are high and recharge when power rates are low. The system can project incoming weather data and program to charge to 100% in anticipation of needing battery backup.
“This estate is a work of art inspired by the legacy and culture of its surroundings,” said Omri Suissa, CEO of Whisper Homes. Complementing its innovative engineering and design are its entertainment features, which make the home ideal for entertaining after a round of golf or a day on the slopes.”
Indoors, the home’s 3,539 sf Main Level includes an expansive great room, dining area, kitchen with natural quartzite slab countertops, a full suite of Miele appliances, and custom dual-temperature wine cellars. The entire primary suite is dedicated to luxurious privacy with a secluded porch and office areas.
This Whisper Homes showcase property was specifically designed for enjoying life indoors and out. The Main Level includes a 1,700-square-foot patio with a fireplace, a built-in barbecue, a spacious jacuzzi accommodating over a dozen people, and Clear Creek Tahoe’s first property offered for sale with an inground swimming pool.
The 1,807-square-foot Upper Level, which is accessible by stairs or elevator, houses a second primary suite and two additional en-suite bedrooms.
The home’s expansive footprint also includes a 2,085-square-foot subterranean garage built for the ultimate thrill seeker. It has space for six cars and ample room for motorcycles, snowmobiles, and golf carts, including two EV car charging ports. The Lower Level also features 1,796 square feet of space for a customizable flex room, ideal for a golf simulator, game room, theater, gym, or spa escape.
Adding to the active lifestyle appeal, the developers have included a Cybertruck in the purchase price. With up to 3,500 pounds of payload capacity and adjustable air suspension, Tesla notes that Cybertruck offers “the most powerful tool we have ever built” and promotes it as “a better utility than a truck and more performance than a sports car.”
Clear Creek Tahoe is a 2,136-acre private residential community with 853 acres in conservation.
Its amenities include a world-class Coore & Crenshaw golf course, ranked as Golfweek’s #1 private course in Nevada and 32nd of the Top 100 U.S. Residential Courses. Resident benefits also include a recently completed clubhouse with fitness and spa services, a Summit Camp pool complex with sports courts, overnight guest cottages, and a historic Twin Pines Lake and Ski House on the shores of Lake Tahoe.
“The Clear Creek Tahoe community is nestled in the incomparable natural splendor of the Sierra and Lake Tahoe region,’ said Georgia Chase, Director of Sales at Clear Creek Tahoe. “Our goal is not merely to construct but to rehabilitate and nurture the natural landscape. This effort extends beyond our own enjoyment, reaching toward a legacy for future generations.”

A major update by local utility authorities is a good outlook for Tesla’s (TSLA) German operations following its extended work stoppage.

As per a report by Reuters, the electricity at Tesla’s Berlin–Brandenburg Gigafactory in Grünheide could be restored as soon as late Mar. 11. Previously, the automaker anticipated power would not be restored until Mar. 17, however the local power company is anticipating power resumption to come sooner.
In a statement, local utility company E.DIS said that the resumption of power is dependent on a high-voltage test, as well as official approval by engineers, which are expected to take place on March 11.
Brandenburg economy minister Joerg Steinbach said that E.DIS employees have been working multiple shifts around the clock to fix and restore power as quickly as they can.
“It now looks like it won’t take until the end of the week, but that the power supply can be restored sooner,” Steinbach told public broadcaster RBB, translated from German.
Tesla’s Berlin Gigafactory is currently experiencing an extensive power outage, which was triggered by a deliberate arson attack by a far-left fringe group. Since the attack, Tesla’s factory was left at a standstill and in a situation where it expects a monetary loss in the “high hundreds of millions of Euros.”
When the line was stopped, more than 1,000 cars were left in various states of assembly, but the EV automaker says that it will take some time to get the line up and running again.
“As soon as [power restoration] has happened, we will gradually start up the systems. It is not yet possible to say how long it will take until production can be fully resumed,” Tesla said in a statement to Reuters.

Tesla German expansion targeted by protesters
The update comes at the heels at a massive protest that took place near the Grünheide factory on Mar. 10 involving hundreds of environmental activists who are against Tesla’s expansion of the plant. At the same time, local residents and plant workers staged a counter demonstration showing support for the American EV automaker.
“We’re here to show the region, our employees, all of Germany, and hopefully the entire world how Tesla employees stand united after this attack,” Tesla Plant Works Council Head Michaela Schmitz told France24 during a rally outside the shuttered factory.
Tesla defended its presence and expansion of its factory in a post on X on March 6, stating that “The Truth” about its Berlin Gigafactory was that it was providing the region with jobs and skills-based training, while claiming to use less water than the rest of the industry and recycling its wastewater.

Tesla's German Gigafactory is getting back to business — earlier than anticipated — after an arson attack forced it to shut down for roughly a week.
Production is slowly resuming, CNN reports, after local energy company E.DIS reconnected the factory to the electricity grid late Monday.
The factory, located outside Berlin, is Tesla's only plant in Europe.
The March 5 attack, which far-left activists claimed responsibility for, dealt a huge blow, given it employs 12,500 people and produces 1,000 cars per day, according to Reuters. The location produces Model Y SUVs and battery cells.
Tesla initially thought the factory might be closed through this week, according to CNN, though it's unknown when production will resume as normal.
The so-called Volcano Group took responsibility for the attack.
They set fire to an electricity pylon near Tesla's plant and took credit for sabotaging the company on the website kontrapolis.info, writing that Tesla ""consumes earth, resources, people, workers and in return spits out 6,000 SUVs, killer cars and monster trucks each week.""
Elon Musk called the group ""eco-terrorists"" on X. ""Stopping production of electric vehicles, rather than fossil fuel vehicles, ist extrem dumm,"" he wrote.

A user on a forum devoted to the funkiest truck on the road alleges that the company has taken action to stop him from reselling his truck at a profit.
Anti-Flipping Clause
The debut of Tesla’s angry hauling pentagon was the automotive story of 2023.
As hype built toward the truck’s arrival, the company publicly debated whether to enact an anti-flipping clause to prevent early buyers from quickly selling their trucks for a profit. Language preventing resale appeared, then disappeared, and later reappeared on the company’s website.
In the end, Tesla kept the policy in place.
Telsa publishes the text of its standard sales contract online. A clause limited to the Cybertruck currently states that owners can only resell the truck in the first year of ownership with Tesla’s permission. Tesla reserves the right to buy back the truck at a price it sets or sue the owner for the profit of any third-party sale.
Owner Reports Purchase Ban
A handful of Cybertruck models have appeared for resale on various websites, all fetching well over their original sale prices. Now, an owner tells the Cybertruck Owner’s Club forum that Tesla may be cracking down.
The user claims to have listed his truck for sale and quickly heard from Tesla representatives. The company didn’t claim a financial penalty or forcibly repurchase the truck, however. Instead, he says, Tesla canceled his reservations for several other cars. He’s now effectively banned, he says, as the company “said if I ever try to place an order again, it will not be refunded.”
We can’t verify the story. However, we should note that anti-flipping rules for rare cars are not unusual.
When a heavily promoted new model appears in limited numbers, inevitably, flippers try to buy it for one price and sell it immediately for a higher one.
The problem can hurt an automaker’s reputation even if the automaker has no real control over the resale of its cars. So, automakers have tried several tactics to prevent flipping.
General Motors in 2022 stripped warranties from some popular models if owners resold them within a year. The company later limited the move to the first six months of ownership.

Tesla’s gigafactory in Grünheide, in Berlin, Germany is set to regain power this week, having been shut down following a suspected arson attack.
The attack last week (March 5) on nearby Steinfurt power substation, run by E.DIS, set an electricity pylon close to the Tesla site on fire, shuttering production for a week and costing Tesla estimated losses of hundreds of millions of euros.
In an update yesterday on LinkedIn, Alexander Montebaur, managing director of energy supply company E.DIS, said that thanks to fast repair work, there is a chance that power could be restored by this evening (March 11). Work on the temporary structure is expected to be completed today and could be ready for commissioning again once successful testing takes place.
A far-left organisation known as Vulkangruppe Tesla Abschalten, or the Vulcan Group or Volcano Group, has taken responsibility for the attack, according to local German media. A letter purporting to be from the group made it clear that the attack was purposefully meant to target Tesla. “We sabotaged Tesla. Tesla consumes earth, resources, people, workers, and in return spits out 6,000 SUVs, killer cars and monster trucks each week,” it said.
The letter added that the site’s planned expansion was a contributing factor to the attack. “In addition to the dirty battery factory, Tesla now wants to expand its factory site by another 100 hectares, including for a freight station. An expansion of the storage and logistics areas directly at the factory, including the possibility of intensive rail logistics, should contribute to stabilising supply chains and production.”
The expansion plans at the site have been protested in recent months, with locals voting against the plans in February. Opponents of the expansion have said the project will impact a water protection zone in the region. However, the vote was not binding and local authorities have the final say in whether the project will go ahead.
In 2021, the group claimed responsibility for a fire at the then under-construction site of the Tesla gigafactory.
German authorities have launched an investigation into last week’s attack, as it also affected critical infrastructure in neighbouring districts.",https://www.automotivelogistics.media/ev-and-battery/teslas-berlin-factory-set-to-restart-after-arson-attack/192100

Before turning its reservations into orders, Tesla tried to take precautions against early buyers flipping the Cybertruck for profits.
The automaker added a “no resell” clause for early VIN Cybertrucks, threatening to sue for $50,000 (or more) and added that it may not sell the sellers any future vehicles.
However, there are limitations when it comes to enforcing these things. After all, you should be able to do what you want with a product you own, including reselling it for a profit, but Tesla can also decide not to do business with you anymore.
That’s apparently exactly what is happening.
Unsurprisingly, we have seen Cybertrucks sell for over $200,000 at auctions. Ford even bought one, seemingly to reverse-engineer it.
Now, one of the owners who put his for sale reports that Tesla has contacted him to let him know that they canceled his two other Cybertruck reservations (via Cybertruck’s Owners Club):
“[Tesla’s] Loss and Prevention flagged me and Store Leader reached out to let me know they cancelled my other reservations.”
Tesla refunded him the $100 in deposit for each order, but it also told him that it won’t in the future. The owner shared this screenshot of the conversation:
At least, the automaker are not suing him for $50,000.
Electrek’s Take
Top comment by HalfwitWizard
I'm conflicted. I think Tesla is actually in the right here, they can put this into a purchase contract in clear language for the original buyer, many automakers have been doing this for decades (Ford Famously sued John Cena and they settled out of court). But I also hate scalpers and hope they are inconvenienced at every step in their lives.
I think Cybertrucks buyers should be able to do whatever they want to do (legally, of course) with theirs vehicles, and Tesla should be allowed to do whatever it wants also, including not doing business with specific people if they don’t want to.
My only problem with this is “why did Tesla allow people to reserve 20 Cybertrucks for $100 each then?” This guy reserved three. Do they really think he was going to keep all three of them?
Of course that was going to happen. Consumers should have been limited to one vehicle during the reservation process and then, free-for-all when orders are opened. If you represent a business and you need a fleet, you can talk directly with Tesla’s fleet unit.
That would make more sense to me.

Tesla Cybertruck owner banned from future orders over resale attempts
It appears that Tesla is attempting to enforce its no-resale agreement on the Cybertruck, as one owner says that they’ve been blacklisted from buying future vehicles from the company.
In recent months, there has been much speculation as to whether Tesla can enforce its Cybertruck no-resale agreement, which asks early owners to avoid selling the limited-quantity vehicle within the first year of ownership. Several Tesla Cybertrucks have been popping up for sale around the internet, and some have been debating whether or not the no-resale clauses were enforceable.
However, in a post in the Cybertruck Owner’s Club forum on Sunday night, owner malinecentral says that Tesla emailed them, canceling additional Cybertruck reservations and canceling future orders, after the user posted the vehicle on multiple online sales platforms.
“Moving forward, any future orders placed by you will be cancelled without a refund of the $100 reservation or $250 order fee as official notification has been provided to you regarding this matter,” Tesla wrote in the email.
Technically, the buyer says they haven’t sold anything, though they listed the Cybertruck on multiple sites to “feel it out.” The user explains that they took delivery of one Cybertruck, had two more reserved, and Tesla went on to cancel the other reservations and refund them.
The poster also says they think they were found through a listing on CarGurus, noting that they did share the VIN on the posts and that they had it listed for $242,069. At the time of writing, there are 20 separate Cybertruck listings on CarGurus, none of them matching malinecentral’s description.
Tesla does seem to take the issue pretty seriously in the agreement:
“Tesla may seek injunctive relief to prevent the transfer of title of the Vehicle or demand liquidated damages from you in the amount of $50,000 or the value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater,” Tesla writes. “Tesla may also refuse to sell you any future vehicles.”
As early Cybertruck deliveries have begun going out over the last few months, Tesla has also been ramping up production at its Gigafactory in Austin, Texas. The automaker expects to take between 12 and 18 months following the initial delivery event to reach volume Cybertruck production, hence the “limited quantity” mentioned in the no-resale policy.

BREAKING: Tesla launches public Robotaxi rides in Austin with no Safety Monitor
Tesla has officially launched public Robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, without a Safety Monitor in the vehicle, marking the first time the company has removed anyone from the vehicle other than the rider.
The Safety Monitor has been present in Tesla Robotaxis in Austin since its launch last June, maintaining safety for passengers and other vehicles, and was placed in the passenger’s seat.
Tesla planned to remove the Safety Monitor at the end of 2025, but it was not quite ready to do so. Now, in January, riders are officially reporting that they are able to hail a ride from a Model Y Robotaxi without anyone in the vehicle:
I am in a robotaxi without safety monitor pic.twitter.com/fzHu385oIb
— TSLA99T (@Tsla99T) January 22, 2026
Tesla started testing this internally late last year and had several employees show that they were riding in the vehicle without anyone else there to intervene in case of an emergency.
Tesla has now expanded that program to the public. It is not active in the entire fleet, but there are a “few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors,” Ashok Elluswamy said:
Robotaxi rides without any safety monitors are now publicly available in Austin.
Starting with a few unsupervised vehicles mixed in with the broader robotaxi fleet with safety monitors, and the ratio will increase over time. https://t.co/ShMpZjefwB

Tesla Robotaxi goes driverless as Musk confirms Safety Monitor removal testing
The Robotaxi program also operates in the California Bay Area, where the fleet is much larger, but Safety Monitors are placed in the driver’s seat and utilize Full Self-Driving, so it is essentially the same as an Uber driver using a Tesla with FSD.
In Austin, the removal of Safety Monitors marks a substantial achievement for Tesla moving forward. Now that it has enough confidence to remove Safety Monitors from Robotaxis altogether, there are nearly unlimited options for the company in terms of expansion.
While it is hoping to launch the ride-hailing service in more cities across the U.S. this year, this is a much larger development than expansion, at least for now, as it is the first time it is performing driverless rides in Robotaxi anywhere in the world for the public to enjoy.
Investor's Corner
Tesla Earnings Call: Top 5 questions investors are asking
Tesla has scheduled its Earnings Call for Q4 and Full Year 2025 for next Wednesday, January 28, at 5:30 p.m. EST, and investors are already preparing to get some answers from executives regarding a wide variety of topics.
The company accepts several questions from retail investors through the platform Say, which then allows shareholders to vote on the best questions.
Tesla does not answer anything regarding future product releases, but they are willing to shed light on current timelines, progress of certain projects, and other plans.
There are five questions that range over a variety of topics, including SpaceX, Full Self-Driving, Robotaxi, and Optimus, which are currently in the lead to be asked and potentially answered by Elon Musk and other Tesla executives:
- You once said: Loyalty deserves loyalty. Will long-term Tesla shareholders still be prioritized if SpaceX does an IPO?
- Our Take – With a lot of speculation regarding an incoming SpaceX IPO, Tesla investors, especially long-term ones, should be able to benefit from an early opportunity to purchase shares. This has been discussed endlessly over the past year, and we must be getting close to it.
- When is FSD going to be 100% unsupervised?
- Our Take – Musk said today that this is essentially a solved problem, and it could be available in the U.S. by the end of this year.
- What is the current bottleneck to increase Robotaxi deployment & personal use unsupervised FSD? The safety/performance of the most recent models or people to monitor robots, robotaxis, in-car, or remotely? Or something else?
- Our Take – The bottleneck seems to be based on data, which Musk said Tesla needs 10 billion miles of data to achieve unsupervised FSD. Once that happens, regulatory issues will be what hold things up from moving forward.
- Regarding Optimus, could you share the current number of units deployed in Tesla factories and actively performing production tasks? What specific roles or operations are they handling, and how has their integration impacted factory efficiency or output?
- Our Take – Optimus is going to have a larger role in factories moving forward, and later this year, they will have larger responsibilities.
- Can you please tie purchased FSD to our owner accounts vs. locked to the car? This will help us enjoy it in any Tesla we drive/buy and reward us for hanging in so long, some of us since 2017.
- Our Take – This is a good one and should get us some additional information on the FSD transfer plans and Subscription-only model that Tesla will adopt soon.
Tesla will have its Earnings Call on Wednesday, January 28.

Elon Musk shares incredible detail about Tesla Cybercab efficiency
Elon Musk shared an incredible detail about Tesla Cybercab’s potential efficiency, as the company has hinted in the past that it could be one of the most affordable vehicles to operate from a per-mile basis.
ARK Invest released a report recently that shed some light on the potential incremental cost per mile of various Robotaxis that will be available on the market in the coming years.
The Cybercab, which is detailed for the year 2030, has an exceptionally low cost of operation, which is something Tesla revealed when it unveiled the vehicle a year and a half ago at the “We, Robot” event in Los Angeles.
Musk said on numerous occasions that Tesla plans to hit the $0.20 cents per mile mark with the Cybercab, describing a “clear path” to achieving that figure and emphasizing it is the “full considered” cost, which would include energy, maintenance, cleaning, depreciation, and insurance.
Probably true
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 22, 2026
ARK’s report showed that the Cybercab would be roughly half the cost of the Waymo 6th Gen Robotaxi in 2030, as that would come in at around $0.40 per mile all in. Cybercab, at scale, would be at $0.20.
This would be a dramatic decrease in the cost of operation for Tesla, and the savings would then be passed on to customers who choose to utilize the ride-sharing service for their own transportation needs.
The U.S. average cost of new vehicle ownership is about $0.77 per mile, according to AAA. Meanwhile, Uber and Lyft rideshares often cost between $1 and $4 per mile, while Waymo can cost between $0.60 and $1 or more per mile, according to some estimates.
Tesla’s engineering has been the true driver of these cost efficiencies, and its focus on creating a vehicle that is as cost-effective to operate as possible is truly going to pay off as the vehicle begins to scale. Tesla wants to get the Cybercab to about 5.5-6 miles per kWh, which has been discussed with prototypes.
Additionally, fewer parts due to the umboxed manufacturing process, a lower initial cost, and eliminating the need to pay humans for their labor would also contribute to a cheaper operational cost overall. While aspirational, all of the ingredients for this to be a real goal are there.
It may take some time as Tesla needs to hammer the manufacturing processes, and Musk has said there will be growing pains early. This week, he said regarding the early production efforts:
“…initial production is always very slow and follows an S-curve. The speed of production ramp is inversely proportionate to how many new parts and steps there are. For Cybercab and Optimus, almost everything is new, so the early production rate will be agonizingly slow, but eventually end up being insanely fast.”",https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-owner-banned-resale/

Advanced Battery Trains Featuring Tesla Megapacks Can Reduce Scope 1 Emissions and High Voltage Transmission Lines (HVTL) Risk of Wildfires, a Fast-Track Concept
RichardFlentge.com
5 min read
CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO / ACCESSWIRE / March 8, 2024 / Adapting Tesla's Megapack to a train car will enable large-scale mobile power storage with the potential to reduce both Scope 1 emissions and (HVTL) high-voltage transmission lines. Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has long touted the market potential of Tesla Energy Operations. Elon's clean energy division manufacturing both solar and battery storage has revenues of just over 6 billion.
Market potential for a battery train with Tesla's Megapacks could skyrocket that revenue to over 20 billion. Remember stringing phone lines to a modem for computer access? That's essentially the US power grid. In his new book Verities of an Electric Mule, author and former co-host of EVTV Richard Flentge has a revolutionary concept, a battery train. The modern version of taking the hardwired power grid wireless, gamechanger. He states ""Battery trains are so ESG, economical, sustainable, and good for life. Let's cut the grid cord and go wireless with battery trains"".
Tesla Megapacks are a low-cost large battery that sits inside a box providing power back-up, often an alternative to gas Peaker plants. It's an engineered fully functional micro utility system with batteries, inverters, and thermal controls with a grid interface, perfect for storing electricity at a fixed point. With some creative engineering and a few cowboys with welders, a prototype battery train could be built in weeks.
Every day 50 miles of train cars fill up with coal in the Powder River basin of Wyoming. They cross multiple states and wildlife areas, no problem. Coal trains got their permits long ago. These 50 miles of trains travel long distances across the US to deliver low sulfur coal, which has a more favorable emission. Railroads love handling coal trains. A coal train, once loaded, has no stops or passengers. Converting the coal train model to a battery train is simple. Instead of rail cars full of black coal, fill them with high energy capacity lithium-ion battery cells. Battery trains can deliver readymade energy right to the people. The locomotive can receive its fuel from a battery system inside the train.
A typical coal train has 135 rail cars filled with 100 tons of coal each. A typical coal plant burns 10,000 tons in one day. Tesla's Megapack on 135 train cars could move 2 Megawatts of power to whatever locale that needs electricity. Tesla Megapack battery train markets would be taking renewable energy to anywhere that has a track and utilities, selling the energy for a profit. The train could easily go right to the coal plant and connect, shutting down the boilers therefore stopping emissions.
Renewables are located where humans are not
In December 2023, CBS's 60 minutes ran a story about Power Company of Wyoming's Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project. In the interview, CEO Bill Miller, was asked what obstacles he was facing to solve his colossal piece of the renewable energy puzzle, how to move Wyoming's wind energy to California. His answer ""permits"". What type of permits? Right of Way, Environmental Impact, Bureau of Land Management, US Fish and Wildlife and Aeronautical, to name a few. The Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project require permits for 800 miles of transmission lines, from southern Wyoming to Las Vegas.
SunZia, the start-up wind farm in New Mexico, is staging for the same, building 550 miles of HVTL to Arizona. Both Chokecherry and SunZia want 200-foot towers of lattice steel looped with 6-inch diameter cable weighing just under 2 pounds per foot. Then they plan to cut a highway wide pathway across arid, pristine, rugged terrain through the windiest sections of the North American continent. What could possibly go wrong? Ask Texas, February's Smokehouse Creek Fire ignited by a downed power line burned 225 square miles, 500 structures and killed two people.
The irony of renewable energy is that change-over has costs, advocates want a solution that will eliminate coal plants and the solution creates another environmental problem. A battery train with Tesla Megapack and grid connectivity eliminates this big renewable location problem. It solves how to transport renewable energy and many existing dangers.
Battery trains stop grid power loss.
When discussing our extensive grid network, the problem of power loss through transmission lines is a prominent issue that needs to be addressed. A room of Electrical Engineers, physicists, and the graduating class from MIT couldn't factor an accurate number as to grid energy lost. Estimates put it at 15%. Step-up transformers, the general resistance of the lines themselves, the step-down process to allow for distribution, and the last sections of the distribution to consumers all contribute to the loss of precious energy. Besides that, the inefficiency of coal burning adds up another 15% loss, resulting in an accurate estimate of above 30%. The complex power grid is losing nearly a third of the energy produced.
The battery train directly stores the energy at the point of where it's produced. It transports electricity to the distribution point and then discharges. Eliminating the multiple steps and all the distance resistance of the transmission lines.
The only way to stop Scope 1 emissions (air pollution from burning fossil fuels) is to reduce the numbers. Battery trains are a fast-track concept to do just that, reduce coal plant emissions with a quick connect to renewables. Elon Musk's Tesla Energy can rebuild the grid, he has the technology, batteries, and grid connectivity software. The Tesla Megapack battery train could be autonomous with adaptation of the full self-driving principles. Elon Musk is someone with the guts to put it together. He has the capability to make the world's power supply essentially wireless, better, stronger, faster.

Tesla’s gigafactory in Grünheide, in Berlin, Germany is set to regain power from as early as today, allowing it to restart production, having been shut down for the past week following a suspected arson attack.
The attack last week (March 5) on nearby Steinfurt power substation, run by E.DIS, set an electricity pylon close to the Tesla site on fire, shuttering production for a week and costing Tesla estimated losses of hundreds of millions of euros.
In an update yesterday on LinkedIn, Alexander Montebaur, managing director of energy supply company E.DIS, said that due to fast repair work, there is a chance that power could be restored by this evening. Work on the temporary structure is expected to be completed today and could be ready for commissioning again, once successful testing takes place.
The Berlin-Brandenburg plant, first announced in 2019 by CEO Elon Musk, is Tesla’s first manufacturing location in Europe. Slated for completion this year, it will manufacture hundres of thousands of Model Y vehicles and millions of battery cells.
A far-left organisation known as Vulkangruppe Tesla Abschalten, or ”The Vulcan (or Volcano) Group Shutting Down Tesla”, has taken responsibility for the attack, according to local German media. A letter apparently from the group made it clear that the attack was purposefully meant to target Tesla. “We sabotaged Tesla. Tesla consumes earth, resources, people, workers, and in return spits out 6,000 SUVs, killer cars and monster trucks each week,” it said.
The letter added that the site’s planned expansion was a contributing factor to the attack. “In addition to the dirty battery factory, Tesla now wants to expand its factory site by another 100 hectares, including for a freight station. An expansion of the storage and logistics areas directly at the factory, including the possibility of intensive rail logistics, should contribute to stabilising supply chains and production.”
The expansion plans at the site have been protested in recent months, with locals voting against the plans in February. Opponents of the expansion have said the project will impact a water protection zone in the region. However, the vote was not binding and local authorities have the final say in whether the project will go ahead.
In 2021, the group claimed responsibility for a fire at the then-under-construction site of the Tesla gigafactory.
German authorities have launched an investigation into last week’s attack, as it also affected critical infrastructure in neighbouring districts.",https://www.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/electrification/teslas-berlin-factory-set-to-restart-production-after-arson-attack/531235

Tesla CEO Elon Musk called the sabotage 'extremely dumb'
Power is restored earlier than expected at the Tesla gigafactory near Berlin after a week-long outage caused by arson, the factory's chief said Monday.
A far-left activist group called Vulkangruppe, translated as the Volcano Group, had claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a nearby electricity pylon that knocked out the factory's power on March 5.
""Lights ON!"" said Andre Theirig, senior director of manufacturing at Giga Berlin, in a LinkedIn post Monday. ""The power supply to the Gigafactory has been restored for a few minutes. Now, under all safety precautions, the measures for the restart are in full swing.""

E.dis, a division of German energy network firm E.ON, confirmed late Monday that the factory had been reconnected to the power grid over the weekend. It said Tesla was reconnected to the grid at 8:45 p.m. local time.

""It will certainly take some time before we have fully resumed production, but the most important step has been taken! Power ON!"" Theirig said.
""Many thanks to E.DIS for the quick recommissioning and to all those involved and especially to our employees for their support over the last few days,"" he added.
Tesla said earlier on Monday that production would gradually resume at the factory, which employs around 12,500 staff, after the power came back on.
""It is not yet possible to say how long it will take until production can be fully resumed,"" Tesla told Reuters in a statement.

The company had said last week it expected the outage to last at least until March 15.
Joerg Steinbach, the economy minister in Brandenburg, said E.dis employees had been working in a three-shift mode to ensure electricity could flow as soon as possible.
The outage prevented Tesla from meeting its production goal of around 1,000 cars per day, with the plant head saying the disruption would cost hundreds of millions of euros in damages.
The Volcano Group took credit for the arson in a 2,500-word letter attacking Tesla and CEO Elon Musk that was distributed to local media. Police said they were aware of the letter, which was signed ""Agua De Pau,"" the name of a volcanic mountain in the Azores, and said they were checking its authenticity.

""We sabotaged Tesla,"" the Agua De Pau letter stated, per Reuters. The letter described the attack as a gift for International Women's Day on March 8.
""Tesla consumes earth, resources, people, workers, and in return spits out 6,000 SUVs, killer cars and monster trucks each week,"" it stated.
Musk ripped the arson attack in several posts on X last week.

Fastest accelerating Porsche ever made has destroyed Model S’s benchmark in its own back yard
That curious new Porsche Taycan with a wing you’ve been seeing zipping around the Nürburgring in 7m 7s has a name. It’s the new Taycan Turbo GT.
Basically, it’s a range-topper above the Turbo S aiming to make life awkward for the Tesla Model S Plaid and Lucid Air Sapphire. It’s now been revealed in full, and it’s terrifyingly fast. Even if you drive a Plaid.
Power? 1,108bhp. Acceleration? 0-62mph in 2.3 seconds. Lap time? It’s just been hurled around Laguna Seca raceway in 1m 27.8s. That’s five seconds faster than the previous electric lap record (help by the Model S). It’s barely half a second slower than a McLaren Senna around the fearsome Californian track.
TopGear.com was there on the ground when the record was set, and then had a stomach-emptying passenger ride with certified bonkers racing driver Lars Kern at the wheel.
The car itself is probably more subtle than you might expect. It looks… like a Taycan. There are new air curtains at the front, forged wheels and lighter ceramic brakes, a token slab of carbon fibre on the B-pillar and a new ducktail spoiler at the back. Visually there’s little sense you’re eyeing a car with not far off TWICE the power of a Carrera GT.
If that’s a little disappointing to you – and you’d like your Turbo GT to announce its digestive tract-bothering speed with a little more gusto – then for the first time on an EV, Porsche will sell you one of its Weissach Packages.
This upgrade deletes the back seats, replacing them with a carbon fibre bulkhead. It swaps the ducktail for a fixed wing good for 140kg of claimed downforce. Lashings of carbon fibre are liberally applied, and the result is a 70kg weight saving.
At a claimed 2,290kg, the Turbo GT Weissach is by no means a light car. And Porsche reckons it’ll be a rare niche option, as the majority of customers will want some back seats. But there’s going to be at least a few folks who want to shave an extra tenth off the 0-62mph run. And the Weissach Pack does it.
Nought to sixty-two in two-point-two seconds. Hope your stomach is as robust as your wallet.
Prices will likely crest the £180,000 mark without too much bother, and the Weissach Pack mit many carbon trim pieces will be the first £200k Taycan. Porsche says it will be built in ‘limited numbers’, perhaps betraying that this is something of an unknown. A toe in the water. The big question you might like to sound off on in the comments is this: will Porsche fans really queue up to buy a hardcore track-focused EV like they do a GT3 RS, or 911 S/T?

The 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N will be the quickest and most powerful Hyundai model of all time, and now we know how much it will cost. The 641-horsepower electric vehicle will cost $66,100 (not including $1,375 freight) and will only be sold in a single, fully loaded trim level.
Here's a reminder of what you get with the Ioniq 5 N. It includes two electric motors that combine to produce 641 hp with N Grin Boost engaged. Those motors can rocket the car up to 60 mph in just 3.25 seconds and onto a top speed of 162 mph. It also gets a new N e-Shift feature, which simulates eight gears from a dual-clutch transmission. We know the N will get a larger 82-kWh battery pack, but the official range is not yet available. As of this writing, Hyundai faces two key competitors: the Kia EV6 GT and the Tesla Model Y Performance.
Competition From Kia EV6 GT
Hyundai's closest competitor comes from its own corporate cousin, the Kia EV6 GT. Since the EV6 is built on the same E-GMP architecture as the Ioniq 5, it boasts similar benefits in terms of charging speed and time. However, since it has a smaller 77.4-kWh battery that only enables a 218-mile driving range. With a bigger battery and other performance improvements, we expect the Ioniq 5 N to go further. The EV6 GT lacks the N e-Shift mode, which is also available on the Genesis GV60 under the name Virtual Gear Shift (VGS).
Kia does have Hyundai beat on pricing, with the EV6 GT starting at $61,600. It's slightly less potent with 576 hp and the official 0-60 mph time is a few ticks slower at 3.4 seconds. That being said, independent tests have measured the Kia as low as 3.2 seconds, so the Ioniq 5 N could be even quicker.
Cheaper Tesla Model Y Performance Not As Capable
The Tesla Model Y Performance is no slouch, and it's far cheaper than the Ioniq 5 N starting at $52,490. It's also eligible for the $7,500 tax credit, unlike the Korean-built Hyundai. In Hyundai's defense, the Ioniq 5 comes fully equipped with 21-inch forged wheels, rear-axle e-LSD, heated and ventilated front seats, and Highway Driving Assist 2. Adding Enhanced Autopilot to a Model Y costs $6,000 while Full Self-Driving Capability (still in beta) is a whopping $12,000. Those options bring the Tesla pretty close to the price of the Hyundai.
With 455 hp on tap, the Model Y Performance is slightly slower to 60 mph at 3.5 seconds. It's also slower flat out at 155 mph. It's unclear how far the Ioniq 5 N will go on a charge but the Tesla can manage 279 miles with its 85-kWh battery. Hyundai touts a 238 kW peak charge speed, which can get the Ioniq from 10% to 80% charge in just 18 minutes. That's around the same rate as the Tesla.",https://carbuzz.com/news/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-costs-more-than-a-tesla-model-y-performance/

- Automaker cancels existing reservations, declines future orders
- Tesla previously said Cybertruck owners who resell would be fined a minimum of $50,000
It looks like Tesla is following through on its anti-flipping Cybertruck clause, with one owner claiming the automaker canceled two of their orders after finding the pickup advertised on several automotive marketplace sites with the VIN.
Cybertruck Owner's Club user malinecentral claims Tesla discovered his Cybertruck for sale and has told him that future reservations will be canceled.
According to the owner, the electric truck hasn't been sold yet but is still listed for sale. ""I have not sold anything. I listed it on multiple sites to feel it out,"" they said. Despite this, Tesla has ensured the customer will not get their hands on another example of the desirable battery-electric pickup.
Per the post, Tesla's Loss and Prevention department flagged malinecentral due to the listings. Later, a Sales Leader confirmed that additional reservations had been canceled.
While the two reservations had been refunded, the automaker said future reservations would not be honored nor refunded. ""Moving forward, any future orders placed by you will be canceled without a refund of the $100 reservation or $250 order fee as official notification has been provided to you regarding this matter,"" read a letter from the company.
The user notes that it's unclear whether this pertains to all Tesla models or just the Cybertruck. If it's the latter, malinecentral won't be able to purchase a brand-new Tesla ever again. Thankfully, the automaker has said it would still offer service options. ""They did say I was welcome for service. I have two other Teslas,"" they added.
It will be interesting to see whether Tesla enforces this with all Cybertruck owners. A brief look at several used car sites shows multiple Cybertrucks for sale, all sporting hefty price tags. In Beverly Hills alone, there are six examples for sale, the cheapest of which is $199,900. Two examples are listed in Denver, Colorado, while five have come up for sale in or near Texas.
Due to solid demand, resellers are taking advantage of the market and selling Cybertrucks for more than double their original MSRP. A Porsche dealership in South Orlando recently got its hands on one and is now selling it for a scandalous $289,999.
Originally, Tesla said it would impose a resell fine of $50,000 or the ""value received as consideration for the sale or transfer, whichever is greater."" The automaker initially reneged on the contract but brought it back late last year, stipulating that customers could not sell their Cybertrucks without permission from Tesla.",https://carbuzz.com/news/tesla-bans-cybertruck-owner-for-listing-electric-truck-for-sale/

This article has been updated to reflect the latest information regarding the reliability of the Tesla Model X. To provide you with the most accurate and current insights, this revision incorporates recent developments and ongoing discussions surrounding the Model X's shortcomings.
In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla and other reliable sources such as NHTSA, Consumer Reports, CarBuzz, and HotCars.
2024 Tesla Model X
The Tesla Model X enters 2024 with no substantial changes. Here's everything you need to know before you buy one.
Design Flaws In The Tesla Model X
The Tesla Model X, once hailed as a revolutionary electric SUV, garnered significant attention for its innovative design and features. However, beneath its sleek exterior lie some shortcomings that have caused frustration for some owners.
From Wow Factor To Woe Factor
The signature falcon-wing doors, while undeniably eye-catching and conversation-starting, have become a source of significant trouble for some Model X owners. These complex, upwards-swinging doors are prone to malfunctions, ranging from inconsistent opening and closing to complete failure. This not only disrupts the intended smooth operation but can also lead to inconvenience and safety concerns. Additionally, sensor malfunctions designed to prevent the doors from hitting objects have resulted in accidents and costly repairs, further adding to the frustration.
The Windshield Conundrum
The Model X boasts a panoramic windshield, offering an impressive, unobstructed view for both driver and passengers. However, this expansive glass surface comes at a cost. Many owners have reported the windshield being susceptible to cracking, even from minor impacts like small stones. While Tesla maintains that these cracks don't pose a safety risk, they can be expensive to repair and hinder driver visibility, impacting both safety and driving experience.
A Bumpy Road
The suspension system, crucial for a comfortable and safe ride, has also raised concerns among some Model X owners. Reports of strange noises emanating from the system raise red flags, indicating potential underlying issues. Additionally, some owners have experienced premature wear and tear on the suspension, leading to costly repairs or replacements. This is particularly concerning for a vehicle positioned as a luxury SUV intended for long journeys under various conditions.

10 Things You Should Know About The Tesla Model X
The Tesla Model X has a lot to offer, from a zippy performance, and massive cargo space, to a tech-loaded cabin.
Power And Range Hampered By Battery And Charging Woes
While Tesla has established itself as a leader in the EV market, the Model X has faced its share of challenges. Despite boasting impressive initial range and performance figures, concerns surrounding battery life, charging difficulties, and a stark contrast to the Model 3's capabilities have tarnished the Model X's reputation.
Battery Deterioration and Reduced Range
Like all batteries, Tesla's, despite their extended life, eventually degrade. This has translated into a real-world concern for some Model X owners, particularly those with older models, who have reported a noticeable decrease in range and overall performance over time. This can be particularly frustrating, as the advertised range of the Model X, originally reaching up to 371 miles, becomes increasingly unattainable.
Charging System Frustrations
Adding to the Model X's woes, the charging system has been a persistent source of frustration for many owners. The car frequently falls short of the advertised range due to the issue of the battery draining too quickly. This is further compounded by reported difficulties in getting the car to charge consistently or maintain a charge.
Another significant drawback of the Model X, for the older models, is its lagging fast-charging capabilities compared to its more affordable sibling, the Model 3. This disparity has been particularly perplexing to consumers, contributing to the Model X's weaker sales performance compared to other Tesla models. The inability to keep pace with the fast-charging advancements of the Model 3 has undoubtedly discouraged potential buyers who prioritize quick and efficient charging experiences.
Tesla Charging: The Complete Guide
Tesla arguably changed the course of EVs in the world, and here's everything you need to know about its charging.
A Bumpy Ride For Model X Owners
The Tesla Model X boasts an impressive array of features and technology, but its air suspension system has been a persistent source of trouble for some owners. This complex system, responsible for adjusting the ride height and handling of the vehicle, has been plagued by issues including:
- Leaking Air Suspensions: Leaks occur in various components of the system, leading to a loss of air pressure and a gradual decline in ride height. This can not only affect the car's handling but also raise concerns about safety and stability.
- Loud Air Compressors: While the air compressor naturally cycles on and off to maintain pressure, some Model X owners have reported unusually loud operation. This can be a sign of wear and tear or potential compressor failure.
- Inconsistent And Uneven Ride Height: The air suspension is designed to automatically adjust the ride height based on various factors. However, some owners have experienced situations where the car sits unevenly, affecting its stance and potentially impacting handling.
Tesla Recalls 7,600 Model S And Model X Vehicles Due To Faulty Airbags
And nope, this actually has nothing to do with the wide-scale Takata airbag recall
Multiple Safety-related Recalls Plague The Model X
The decision to purchase a car hinges on various factors, but safety undoubtedly reigns supreme. The Tesla Model X, however, has cast a shadow over its image with a concerning history of safety-related recalls, raising serious questions about its reliability and adherence to safety standards.
A Concerning Track Record
The 2022 Model X alone paints a concerning picture, having been recalled over 15 times for safety issues. These issues encompass a wide range of crucial functionalities, including:
- Seat belt malfunction: In July 2023, Tesla recalled nearly 16,000 Model S and Model X due to a potential seat belt issue. The issue involved the front-row seat belts potentially not being properly connected, which could increase the risk of them detaching in a collision.
- Airbag malfunction: Improper deployment of side airbags during collisions poses a significant risk to passenger safety. A total of 7,600 Teslas (Model S & X) where affected by the recall in 2021.
Beyond The Model X
These issues extend beyond the Model X. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) prompted Tesla to recall nearly 362,000 vehicles, in February 2023, due to concerns with the Autopilot software. The NHTSA cited the system's ability to ""exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner,"" highlighting a potential risk of crashes arising from the software's functionality.
Tesla Recalls Over 2 Million Cars Over A Potential Safety Issue, And Here's Why
Tesla recalls millions of vehicles due to undersized fonts used for critical warning lights on the instrument panel, posing a potential safety risk.
Addressing Early Model Concerns
Though the Model X was a trailblazer in the electric SUV market, earlier models encountered reliability challenges, evident in multiple recalls and reports of build quality and software issues. It's important to distinguish these concerns from the 2024 Model X, which has only faced one recall to date and incorporates improvements addressing past issues.
Tesla Model X 2024 Updates
The 2024 Model X addresses some of the concerns raised about previous models.
- Improved Build Quality: While concerns persist in some reviews, Tesla claims to have made strides in enhancing the overall build quality.
- Steering Wheel Option: The controversial yoke steering wheel is no longer the only option. Buyers can now choose a traditional flat-bottomed steering wheel.
- Redesigned Glass Roof: The new glass roof allows for more natural light, improving the interior experience.
The 2024 Model X Is An Epitome Performance And Efficiency
The 2024 Tesla Model X boasts impressive performance, aiming to rival even modern sports cars. Offered in two configurations, the base Model X and the high-performance Plaid, both deliver exceptional acceleration and handling.
- Thrilling Acceleration: The standard Model X packs a punch with 670 horsepower and rockets from 0 to 60 mph in a claimed 3.8 seconds. Real-world tests have even shown even faster times, with older models achieving a 3.3-second sprint.
- Plaid Power: Upgrading to the Model X Plaid unleashes even more power, with a tri-motor setup generating 1,020 horsepower. This translates to a 2.5-second 0-60 mph time.
- Exceptional Handling: Both models benefit from a drag coefficient of 0.24. This translates to better handling and efficiency. Additionally, the Plaid boasts torque vectoring for sharper cornering and upgraded brakes for enhanced stopping power.
- Adaptive Comfort: Tesla equips both models with adaptive air suspension, providing a comfortable ride while maintaining impressive handling capabilities.
- Efficiency Considerations: While not the most frugal option in Tesla's lineup, the Model X offers decent efficiency. The base model leads the pack with a 102 MPGe EPA-estimated combined energy consumption. The Plaid's efficiency varies depending on wheel size, ranging from 91 to 98 MPGe.
- Towing and Payload: The Model X proves its versatility with a 5,000-pound towing capacity and a 654-pound payload capacity, making it a capable choice for hauling cargo or trailers.

The Tesla Cybertruck started its first deliveries in November of 2023 and has quickly taken the internet by storm. The truck, which features a very divisive design, has been popping up on YouTube and social media from anyone who has seen it or actually been able to get hands-on with it.
Tesla is ramping up production of the electric truck to keep up with initial demand but most people who preordered are waiting (and likely will be waiting) some time before they will actually get to take delivery of their new truck. However, if you were one of the people who managed to preorder the Foundation Series Cybertruck, you might be able to jump to the front of the line and get your delivery earlier than everyone else.
Tesla has launched a new page on its website that is accepting applications to get earlier delivery of your Foundation Series Cybertruck. People with preorders can sign up for early delivery by March 22nd but you can only sign up for one of your reservations. This early delivery program is also only available in the United States and Canada.
Sign up by Friday, March 22, 2024 11:59 PM CT CDT to take early delivery of a Foundation Series Cybertruck. If confirmed, you will receive an email with additional details prior to the delivery. This program is limited to one reservation per customer and currently available only in the US and Canada.
In order to qualify for earlier delivery, you'll need to meet all of the eligibility requirements which include your reservation date being before March 1st, that you haven't gotten a Cybertruck yet, and — here's the kicker — the fact that you need to own at least 500 shares of Tesla stock.
That Tesla stock one is brutal, although it feels like the people buying the Cybertruck are already so all-in on Tesla that there might actually be a chance that a lot of them actually own that much Tesla stock. To the moon, Elon!
You can check out all of the eligibility requirements below:
- The Cybertruck reservation must be in the participant's name and have been made prior to March 1st, 2024;
- The participant has not yet taken delivery of a Cybertruck;
- Each participant must provide brokerage statements showing that you owned TSLA shares on Feb. 28, 2021 and owned at least 500 TSLA shares on Feb. 29, 2024;
- The brokerage statements for Feb. 29, 2024 must show that you owned at least 50% of the TSLA shares that you owned on Feb. 28, 2021; and
- Brokerage statements proving shareholdings must clearly show first/last name, statement date, and Tesla shares. All other information may be redacted.
It seems that the company wants to thank those who have supported them not only by purchasing their vehicles but also by putting money into the company's stock as well. That's an interesting program and quite a unique way for people to jump the line ahead of others.
While you would have had to own Tesla stock since 2021 to qualify for the program, I wondered what it would cost to buy your way into early delivery today if the company allowed it. If you bought 500 shares of Tesla stock today to get early delivery of your Cybertruck (which you can't do) it would cost you over $88,000 — more than many configurations of the truck itself.
If you meet the qualifications, you can sign up for early delivery on Tesla's Early Cybertruck Delivery page.
This kind of early access program isn't new. Rivian, which just unveiled the R2, R3, and R3X at an event last week, is offering early delivery of the R2 to current R1T and R1S owners. That's a different strategy than requiring Rivian stock, but it does still give early supporters first dibs on its upcoming electric SUV.
The point of all of this? If you get in early, you might end up with some perks.",https://www.bgr.com/lifestyle/get-your-cybertruck-before-everyone-else-if-you-own-88000-of-tesla-stock/

In a remarkable incident on the South Eastern Freeway in Adelaide, Australia, a 67-year-old man credits Tesla’s Autopilot system for potentially saving his life and those of other motorists.
The driver, who prefers to remain anonymous, experienced a medical episode while driving his Tesla Model 3 RWD, leading to a near-catastrophic situation that was narrowly averted.
Terrifying dashcam footage from the incident, which occurred last year on June 18, shows the Tesla veering across multiple lanes and medians, miraculously avoiding collisions with oncoming traffic and bouncing off a cable fence.
The driver recounted the harrowing experience only now to Adelaide Now, saying, “I felt a tingling in my head and woke up in an ambulance,” he said. He later saw footage of the event at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, where a doctor showed him his car’s dashcam video, saying, “this is you mate!”
The driver believes Tesla’s Autopilot played a critical role in preventing a crash. “My interpretation of the events from the video is that as I was drifting across the lanes, the warnings from the car would have been coming,” he explained. He surmised that the car sensed danger and attempted to navigate to safety, despite the chaos.
The dashcam footage indicates the Tesla’s acceleration helped it dodge oncoming traffic. The driver expressed his uncertainty about the extent of the car’s autonomous intervention but noted, “the luck we all had was a bit too convenient.” He added, “The Tesla is capable of intervening, for better or for worse, and it seems that it had a say in the outcome.”
Expressing his gratitude, the man also acknowledged the distress caused to other motorists and thanked the emergency services for their prompt response. “I can only feel sympathy for the unfortunate people scared witless by a crazy car coming towards them,” he said.
It’s unclear if this Tesla had Full Self-Driving enabled to allow the car to steer away from danger, but with regular Autopilot, if a driver does not respond to audible warnings to keep hands on the wheel, the car will come to a complete stop and turn on hazard lights. The video below seems to show the car may have had its accelerator pressed based on the speed it was going. We’ll never really know, but Tesla likely has data on this vehicle’s crash.

In his recent post on the X social medial platform, formerly known as Twitter, the senior public policy and business development executive at Tesla said that Southeast Asia will undoubtedly be a major place of growth over the coming years in battery storage and electric vehicle adoption, noting that the region has emerged as one of the hottest EV markets inrecent years and could offer Tesla a large customer base at a time when demandis slowing in the US.
TheMalaysian government had last year given Tesla the license to sell its cars inthe country and said the firm would also establish a network of chargingstations there.
Teslais also in talks for expanding its operations in other countries, including inThailand, which is Southeast Asia's largest car producer and exporter.
AThai government official said earlier this month that the company had discusseda potential production facility after surveying a site late in 2023.
However,Tesla's ambitions for Southeast Asia will face competition fromBYD, which has overtook rivals to account for more than a quarter of the EVssold in the region.
Incontrast with Tesla's direct-to-consumer approach, BYD has partnered withlarge, local conglomerates that have allowed the carmaker to expand reach, testconsumer preferences and navigate complex government regulations in the region.
TheChinese EV maker sold more than 26% of all cars in Southeast Asia's small butfast-growing EV market in the second quarter of 2023, while Tesla accounted forabout 8%, according to the Hong Kong-based industry analysis firm Counterpoint.
EVs constituted 6.4% of allpassenger vehicle sales in the region in the quarter, up from 3.8% in thepreceding quarter./.",https://en.vietnamplus.vn/southeast-asia-becomes-teslas-priority-for-expansion-post282844.vnp

Chao, 50, died on Feb. 11 after her vehicle was found submerged in the pond located on her 900-acre ranch in Blanco County, Texas.
Chao left a Lunar New Year party with close friends at about 11:30 p.m. that night for a 4-minute drive from a guest house to her residence on the property, the Journal reported.
She then called one of her friends minutes after she left them, saying that her vehicle, a Tesla Model X SUV, wound up in a pond after she attempted to make a three-point turn. She said the vehicle was sinking.
Chao told her friend that she had put her car in reverse instead of drive, the Journal reported, something that she had done before, according to a report from Blanco County Emergency Services obtained by the Austin American-Statesman.
By the time some of Chao’s friends and a property ranch manager got to the pond, the SUV was submerged. Over the next several hours, her friends, then the ranch manager and his wife, and first responders tried to break the windows or find an escape hatch to get Chao out of the car, the Journal reported.
“The two deputies who were in the water standing on the submerged vehicle requested tools to break the window of the vehicle to perform a possible rescue. One EMS crew member donned water rescue PPE and entered the water with a Hallagan tool. One Fireﬁghter entered the water wearing proper water PPE relaying tools to attempt rescue, several tools were used to attempt access to the victim,” the report said.
Eventually, the vehicle was towed out of the water and Chao was removed and found unresponsive, the Journal reported. Chao was declared deceased at the scene and not taken to a hospital. No autopsy was performed.
According to the Journal, the Blanco County Sheriff’s Office has denied requests for information, citing its ongoing investigation.
“Although the preliminary investigation indicated that this was an unfortunate accident, the Sheriff’s Office is still investigating this accident as a criminal matter,” the Blanco County public information officer said in a Feb. 29 letter to the Texas attorney general to explain why public information requests should be denied.
The officer said in an email Friday to the Journal that the investigation hasn’t been completed.
Chao is the sister-in-law of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. In his announcement that he was stepping down as minority leader, McConnell referenced Chao’s death.
“This has been a particularly difficult time for my family,” he said. “We tragically lost Elaine’s younger sister Angela just a few weeks ago. ""
According to someone familiar with the matter, Chao’s death was a factor in the timing of his decision to step down, the Journal reported.

It has been four years since Elon Musk botched the exhibition of his company’s first electric pickup truck, by touting “unbreakable,” “bulletproof,” “Armor Glass” windows that broke easily after contact with a metal ball. (The windows being easy to break might have been a good thing, however: As the Wall Street Journal reported recently, the shipping executive Angela Chao died in a tragic accident after she backed her Tesla Model X into a pond and firefighters, police, and paramedics were unable to break the Tesla’s windows and rescue her.)
Having now recovered from myriad parts-sourcing and manufacturing issues, the Cybertruck has seen its belated introduction to prime time greeted with much hype—and worry. It’s not just the overwhelming size and weight of the thing, or its documented struggles in scaling off-road hills, or its sharp, stainless steel edges, all of which could prove fatal in the event of a collision with pedestrians, bikers, or other drivers. Really, it’s … basically everything about this boxy monstrosity. During the November rollout at Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory, tech reporters and other observers made note of the truck’s complicated doors, its floppy and lengthy windshield wipers (which … don’t cover the entire windshield, are rather expensive to replace, and apparently “flop around like a wet noodle”), its windows’ rebranding as “rock-proof” instead of “bulletproof,” and its incredibly faulty anti-crash features. Not long after the event, even more concerning elements came to the public’s attention, in the least ideal way possible: publicly, and dangerously.
Let’s lay out a little timeline here:
• Just a few days after the rollout, a transportation-focused TikTokker posted a popular video showing off the Cybertruck’s alarming “visibility fails,” including the driver’s obstructed front and rear views, and the lack of easy functionality for gear shifts and land-change indicators.
• A few days after that, Instagram user Matt Chambers shared videos from an off-road trail in Bear Valley, California, where a Cybertruck slid far from the track and had to get towed by a Ford pickup driven by his friends. It turns out, per an update to the caption, that this truck had “traction control issues due to software problems, not aired down, no pickup points, poor choice of tires and no recovery points!” Thanks to the popularity of the videos, Chambers is now selling a limited-edition “CyberStuck” sticker, in case you’re interested.
• A late-December head-on collision in Palo Alto between a Cybertruck and a teen-driven 2009 Toyota Corolla all but destroyed the latter’s front end, although, thankfully, no passengers in either vehicle were seriously hurt.
• By early January, it became apparent the Cybertruck was not up to the job of navigating an extremely snowy winter, thanks to faulty tires unable to find traction in fluttery conditions. Social media posts from drivers showed their trucks stranded on the side of the road, blanketed by snow.
• Later that month, after Cybertruck owners complained that their vehicles’ mileage capacities per charge were far lower than advertised, another off-road-driving YouTuber detailed his struggles with operating the truck’s locking software and the Cybertruck’s difficulty navigating the inclines in a Texas dirt-road park. Humiliatingly, his friends managed to tackle the park just fine in their Subaru Crosstrek and Toyota 4Runner.
• In early February, a immediately viral, now-deleted video from user @blakestonks showed us the worst of both worlds: a Cybertruck driver going hands-free on the highway while wearing an Apple Vision Pro headset and clearly occupied with some sort of virtual game. Other outlets reshared the clip:
• Also in early February, at the desert-racing King of the Hammers tournament, a Cybertruck’s rear wheels popped off after its driver put it through what Futurism called “some gnarly donuts.” The Cybertruck wasn’t the only vehicle there to undergo technical difficulties—but, because it’s an all-wheel drive, it was the only vehicle whose rear wheels broke off. Not great for a supposedly invincible juggernaut. (Oh, and did we mention that the Cybertruck’s tires are already weaker than most, thanks to tightly applied wheel covers that rub up against the rubber?)
• This has already earned quite a bit of attention at this point, but it’s worth reiterating that not only did Musk’s insistence on a stainless-steel exterior for the Cybertruck lead to yearslong manufacturing delays but has now fueled customer dissatisfaction with the discoloration and “orange rust” stains that affect the truck’s look whenever it gets wet. As Wired explains, “The Cybertruck does not ship with a clear coat,” but you can purchase a $5,000 Tesla-produced wrap if you’d like to keep your shiny truck from looking all corroded. So much for stainless!
• To kick off March, tweeter Matthew Chiarello shared this harrowing story in a now-deleted post: “Love @tesla and my @cybertruck but ‘catastrophe failure’ with steering and brakes while on a road trip with wife and toddler. … Pretty pretty pretty not good. Oh and service center not open today. @elonmusk.” Pretty much explains itself.
• Another early-March post from a Cybertruck owner that earned some attention: “I’ve had my truck for two days, got in this morning, everything was on. Went to press the brake to put it in reverse and everything went black. Power door button wouldn’t even let me out, had to use manual release to get out. I can not get back in either. My battery is at 40%, so no it’s not dead.” Ah, well, nevertheless.
• Last Tuesday, a local news channel in Monterey County filmed a Cybertruck that “got stuck while illegally driving on Marina State Beach.” The drivers could only push it away from the beach after the local fire department arrived to deflate the tires. Naturally, many online observers had fun with this image, recalling memories of the big ol’ boat that got stuck in the Suez Canal almost exactly three years ago.
• Only a few hours after sharing an Instagram video in which he flexed his new Cybertruck, the up-and-coming rap star 2Rare admitted that he’d crashed it into a sign outside the Beverly Hills Hotel, an incident that gained even Elon Musk’s attention. 2Rare’s reaction to seeing his whip literally go up in flames? “Iknoo i F#^ked that money upp yall iknoo.”
• On Friday, the popular YouTube reviewer JerryRigEverything decided to test the Cybertruck’s “bulletproof” claim by firing a .223-caliber AR-15 at its steel walls, which indeed gave way to the powerful rifle’s bullets.
• Oh, and by the way, if you wanna attach a “Basecamp” tent to the back of your Cybertruck, it’ll cost you $3,000, and the tent will be nowhere near as sturdy or as adaptable to your truck’s needs as advertised.
• Over the weekend, a Texas-based electric vehicle enthusiast tweeted a video of his Cybertruck’s screen flashing red with a “critical steering issue” warning, forcing him to pull over in a parking lot. What ended up fixing this? “Walking away from the vehicle and coming back resolved the issue,” he wrote.
• Also over the weekend, Tesla fan and TikTokker Jeremy Judkins posted a video of what will happen should you find yourself locked inside the Cybertruck’s trunk, or Cybertrunk: There is no glow-in-the-dark emergency release—normally a standard feature for passenger vehicles—and the space contains internal sound pretty effectively. Another issue Tesla just might wanna fix.
Well! That should suffice in bringing you up to speed on the fragile state of the Cybertruck, dear reader. Little wonder that fans of Golden State Warriors star Gary Payton II are begging him not to get one for himself—even as resale prices for the truck reach record lows, thanks to disaffected owners flooding the auction market with their discolored, damaged, unsafe, complicated, and possibly wheel-less vehicles. (But if you try to list your Cybertruck for resale, Tesla might retaliate against your account and cancel your other reservations with the company, according to Electrek.) For Elon Musk, who’s betting a lot on Cybertruck success for the sake of Tesla’s business, that may end up being the worst crash of all: the hit to his market share. Who knows? Maybe it’ll take another four years to helm a safer version.",https://slate.com/technology/2024/03/tesla-cybertruck-elon-musk-accident.html
