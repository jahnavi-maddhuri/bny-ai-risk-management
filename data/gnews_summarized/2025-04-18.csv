EXHIBIT #1: TOP 25 S&P500 DRAWDOWNS
Source: BNY, Bloomberg
The focus on retail over institutional money flows has been a long-standing tradition. Compared to larger institutional flows, retail has smaller tickets, trades less frequently and has a higher correlation to trend. However, in times of stress, retail buyers can help define tops and bottoms for markets via the animal spirits they unleash. There is a Wall Street adage learned during Covid and Meme stock eras saying to “never to fade retail flows”. Buying a 2% dip in the S&P500 makes money, but some analysts argue this is a sample error from the last 5 years. Many of the current U.S. retail traders in stocks have less than 10 years of experience, meaning they missed the pains of 1987, 1997, 1998, 2001, 2007 and 2008. The bigger question is whether there is a signal that can help differentiate when retail is proven wrong.
Our take
The last 5 years have had a 10% return using a straightforward process: buy-the-dip when the S&P500 moves more than 2%, hold for 1 month, then sell. This method has worked 75% of the time. The holding period could be longer, but that increases risk and volatility versus reward. The notable lesson post-Covid has been that markets are orderly and protected by policy expectation shifts. Retail investors have learned this lesson and were key drivers for overall market shifts in sentiment. The problem arises when drawdowns in equity markets are larger than 2%. The last 75 years of the S&P500 show that buying the dip doesn’t work, and instead loses 75% about 7% of the time. Buying during a bigger drop in stocks is only successful when the Fed eases. The bounce back last week was due to the pause on tariffs causing policy shifts, not monetary policies. Trade talk will prove if these changes are sufficient.
EXHIBIT #2 : IFLOW U.S. SECTOR CORRELATION VS. VIX
Source: BNY, Bloomberg
Our view
In the last 3 weeks of trading, investors saw a sharp rise in the VIX index, suggesting volatility was overwhelming returns. Our data suggests that institutional investors cut back risks in an orderly outflow. These changes can all been linked to uncertainty around U.S. tariffs and policies. Notably, in March and April our flow showed less stock picking and broader stock indices trading. This is where institutional flows and retail flows interact. Buying U.S. shares on the biggest outflows were mostly in ETFs linked to the S&P500 and the NASDAQ 100. The Magnificent 7 also played a role but little else was bought otherwise. The correlation between sectors for our institutional flows peaked last week and has since fallen from 0.55% correlation. This suggests a broad market deleveraging, rather than any one sector or set of stocks being sold. The April 3 and April 4 retail buying against ongoing volatility peaking stands out in our flows, showing “retail” interest at 2-3 times the normal amount for the month.
Forward look
The key component for equity market instability is how stocks trade as a market or a diversified bottom-up set of equity names, albeit at elevated volatility. Some of this information shows up cyclically in earnings seasons. Micro meets macro over the next 3 weeks while retail takes a pause and waits for institutional flows to lead. We see a high correlation of trading ETFs to retail dominance over institutional uncertainty.
EXHIBIT #3 : INSTITUTIONAL VS. RETAIL FLOW FOR U.S. EQUITIES
Source: BNY
On April 3 and 4 our data was dominated by retail flows volume spiking to 2-3 times the normal amount. Buying the SPY and VOO ETFs (S&P500) accounted for most of the flows, supported by some Magnificent 7 names. The lack of retail buying in fixed income ETFs over the last month started to switch this week but remains lower than January or February levels.
The role of “buying the dip” relates to the view of how long markets can last in a volatile and negative return state. The problem for investors simply following the retail buyer - or just buying every big dip in markets - is that this method can fail. The start of Q2 equity market trading has been notable for its volatility and persistence. Historically, the top 25 biggest S&P500 drawdowns show that only 25% have positive returns. This is a warning shot for April 2025, and I bought this dip. Outsized moves down have a tipping point linked to volatility and the state of the economy. The shocks of 1987 and 2008 were memorable, but still less painful than post-March 2020. The risk for the rest of April rests on how the FOMC reacts to financial conditions. The history of 2008 trading suggests you need bigger policy turn to get the dip to work."

Insight | 2025-04-18
16 minute read
Over the past two years since the emergence of large language models (LLMs) as the foundation for generative AI, the pace of progress has accelerated rapidly. In particular, AI agents capable of autonomously executing tasks based on generative AI have garnered increasing attention. These autonomous AI agents integrate generative AI with traditional AI technologies, offering flexible and advanced capabilities. As a result, AI agents can now handle complex tasks and meet a wide range of user needs.
On the other hand, the financial sector has a strong affinity with AI in both tasks that require language processing and tasks that involve data processing, such as analyzing vast amounts of transaction data. Currently, the financial services industry, which continues to undergo transformation through AI, is entering an era of change defined not just by generative AI, but also by AI agents.
This article will explore the structure and functionality of AI agents, examining their impact on the financial industry and how human-AI agent collaboration is shaping the future of financial services.
1．What are AI agents?
There are various definitions of AI agents, but simply put, an AI agent is a digital system capable of interacting independently within a dynamic environment. While such systems existed even before the advent of large language models (LLMs), AI agent systems based on generative AI (LLM-based) can understand given goals and contexts, create their own action plans, and use online tools and data to complete tasks. Furthermore, these agents can collaborate with other agents and humans, learn, and improve their performance through memory. In other words, AI agents consist of not only LLMs but also components such as database access, API integration, rule-based engines (traditional AI), and interfaces with external systems(1).
Figure 1 illustrates a conceptual diagram showing the differences in workflows between generative AI (LLM) and AI agents. With generative AI, humans are typically involved in the workflow, directly influencing the AI system's decisions and tasks. On the other hand, AI agents can autonomously complete the tasks assigned to them, with humans serving a supervisory role, intervening only when anomalies or unexpected situations arise. However, it’s important to understand that inference models like OpenAI-o1 can autonomously perform tasks that require multiple steps from a single prompt, making a direct comparison with AI agents difficult and highlighting that this is an evolutionary process.
Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)
The AI agents discussed so far are based on single-agent systems, which are designed to perform tasks or workflows for small teams or organizations. However, when it comes to complex workflows in larger organizations or ecosystems, single-agent systems have their limitations. This is because large-scale organizations and different domains require unique knowledge and workflows. To address this challenge, the concept of a ""Multi-Agent System (MAS)"" has been proposed.
MAS allows multiple agents to interact and share information, enabling them to handle tasks that span across multiple domains more efficiently. Additionally, through interactions between agents, collective intelligence and emergent solutions can be created, much like how humans collaborate.
When a multi-agent system is viewed as a set of single functions or attributes (refer to Figure 2), the AI agents dynamically construct a system to achieve the given task and its goals. The main functions and attributes are as follows:
１）Planning: Systematically designing and coordinating the necessary actions or tasks to achieve the goal.
２）Scalability: The AI effectively leverages external tools and resources (such as databases, APIs, specific software, etc.) to expand its capabilities.
3)Enrichment: Utilizing diverse data in various contexts to gain insights from multiple perspectives.
4)Connectivity: Multiple AI agents collaborate, sharing information and dividing tasks to address complex problems and large-scale projects.
5)Proactivity: Deciding what task to take on next, solving non-obvious tasks, and expanding knowledge to help the agent grow.
6)Adaptability: Continuously updating by incorporating basic information and changes in dynamic data.
Extending and Resolving Issues with LLMs
In addition to the core functions of AI agents discussed earlier, LLMs can be extended and their issues mitigated by integrating memory mechanisms, accessing external tools and information sources, and interacting with the environment.
(1) Memory and Context Retention
While LLMs are stateless and do not remember past interactions, AI agents typically incorporate memory mechanisms, allowing them to store past interactions and maintain consistency and continuity over long-term engagement. By leveraging past context, agents can improve future responses and enhance the user experience.
(2) Enhanced Functionality through Asynchronous and Parallel Processing
LLMs process inputs synchronously and sequentially, but AI agents can handle multiple tasks simultaneously and operate asynchronously. This allows agents to manage real-time interactions more effectively, improving efficiency and responsiveness when handling multiple queries or tasks at once.
(3) Fact-Checking and Real-Time Information Access
AI agents can mitigate the ""hallucination"" problem and incorrect outputs of LLMs by performing real-time data validation and integrating with external tools (such as databases, web APIs, or the internet). This is particularly valuable in applications where up-to-date and accurate information is crucial. Furthermore, by interfacing with specialized mathematical engines or software, agents can perform precise mathematical calculations, which enhances their utility in technical and scientific fields.
2. AI Agents in Financial Services: Impact, Use Cases, and Early Adoptions
Today’s financial industry faces challenges such as difficulty in securing talent and decreased productivity due to frequent task switching, all within an environment of fierce competition. Financial institutions are not only seeking systems that can perform tasks but also ones that can analyze risks, predict market changes, and make accurate, risk-informed decisions. Autonomous AI agents, equipped with vast knowledge and high expertise, have the potential to turn these challenges into opportunities.
Benefits of Utilizing AI Agents
By implementing AI agents, financial institutions and market participants can enhance workflow optimization, improve customer experiences, drive innovation in services and business models, strengthen compliance, and improve decision-making, all of which can help them achieve a competitive edge.
The benefits of utilizing AI agents in the financial services industry can be summarized in the following four points:
1)Streamlining Operations By automating repetitive tasks such as data entry, compliance checks, and transaction processing, AI agents enhance productivity, reduce human errors, and enable employees to focus on more strategic tasks.
2)Enhancing Customer Interactions AI agents provide highly personalized experiences for customers. These agents help individuals manage their finances, make optimal decisions, and adjust strategies based on personal goals and risk levels, empowering users like never before.
3)Driving Innovation AI agents enable the creation of new financial tools, such as personalized robo-advisors and adaptive asset management systems, that can adjust strategies in real time based on market changes and customer preferences.
4)Improving Risk Management and Compliance AI agents enhance real-time risk assessments, monitor suspicious transactions, and dynamically respond to emerging threats and anomalies. They also streamline compliance by automating regulatory reporting and ensuring adherence to complex financial regulations.
Use Cases of AI Agents in Financial Services
Financial services span multiple domains, including banking, insurance, securities, asset management, and credit card services. The development of AI agent use cases in these areas is progressing, with some use cases being applicable across multiple domains and others being specific to particular sectors. Table 1 below shows the primary use cases expected for four common functional areas across financial institutions.
Our research indicates that the use of generative AI in the financial industry is currently limited to specific tasks such as customer support and knowledge acquisition, leading to improvements in operational efficiency. However, its application to core business functions has been slow. This delay can be attributed to several factors, including technical challenges in implementing generative AI, inaccuracies in output caused by the model's hallucination issues, concerns about data security, and the difficulty of evaluating return on investment. However, the advantages of AI agents, such as memory retention, context awareness, enhanced asynchronous and parallel processing, fact-checking, and access to real-time information, can be leveraged to expand their use in core financial services operations.
Early Adoptions of AI Agents in Financial Services
AI agents are leading the digital transformation in the financial industry. Evolving from traditional rule-based AI to large language model (LLM)-based generative AI, they are at the forefront of change. While the financial sector is still in the learning phase, several early-use cases have been successfully implemented. Below are three such examples.
Moody’s – Financial Analysis Agent
Moody’s developed 35 agents, including specialized AI agents for tasks like project management, and integrated them into a ""multi-agent system"" where they collaborate with supervising agents(2). This system is used to analyze SEC filings and industry data, enhancing their research capabilities. The AI agents are specialized in specific tasks, and by having other agents verify the results, they can efficiently execute complex workflows.
Auquan – Financial Industry-Specific Digital Analyst
The automation of analyst tasks using AI agents is progressing. The startup Auquan developed an AI agent that specializes in creating financial industry reports, which is different from OpenAI's ""Deep Research,"" designed for general purposes(3). For example, it collects and analyzes financial data (including unstructured data such as presentations and PDFs) and internet information to generate reports. This method is 80–90% cheaper and significantly more productive than manual report generation. Clients include MetLife, UBS, and Capital Group. Auquan has announced plans to extend its AI solutions to risk management, compliance, and sustainability workflows, and it is believed that these are now being implemented.
Capital One – Chat Concierge Agent
Capital One has introduced a chat concierge that uses multiple AI agents to comprehensively address customer inquiries related to car purchases(4). The concierge supports the entire purchase process, from vehicle comparison to test-drive reservations, easing the customer's burden. With a customized Llama AI-based model, it responds instantly to customer questions and can perform multiple tasks at once, such as providing trade-in estimates and setting appointments with sales representatives.
BNY– The Approach to Multi-Agent Systems
BNY has implemented a multi-agent system that includes 13 specialized agents, providing sales representatives with lead generation and recommendations through AI agents. The AI tool ""Eliza"" quickly understands client needs, improving sales efficiency, while multiple agents collaborate to produce the best outcomes(5). In addition, through a partnership with OpenAI, BNY is integrating new features into Eliza via an API, enabling the resolution of complex tasks and the acquisition of insights. By leveraging cutting-edge reasoning models and agent functions (Deep Research, Operator), BNY expects to enhance Eliza's accuracy and autonomy(6).
Summary
The use cases of AI agents in the financial industry, as demonstrated by the above examples, are currently limited to market trend intelligence analysis, extracting information from messy metadata, addressing complex customer needs, and managing compliance. However, the development of use cases and the evolution of related technologies are progressing steadily. For example, Fujitsu has developed technologies such as risk-response agents(7) and meeting agents(8), working with internal teams and financial institution clients to assess the impact of AI agents on operations and explore the optimal process for their implementation.
3. A Vision for the Future of Financial Services: Human-AI Agent Collaboration
Building on the discussions thus far, the evolution of AI’s natural language understanding is making human-machine interactions increasingly intuitive and flexible. Against this backdrop, we can envision a future where AI agents autonomously execute business processes, driving the transformation of financial services. However, the introduction of AI agent systems also brings potential challenges, such as an increase in systemic risks and volatility in financial markets, disruptions in the labor market, and the emergence of new security risks. Additionally, ethical and privacy concerns, as well as the opacity of outcomes resulting from autonomous decision-making, are important considerations. Therefore, it is essential to balance the pursuit of AI agent autonomy in financial services with addressing the challenges that arise from it.
In reality, the role of humans in financial services will need to be redefined in the age of AI agents. Specifically, the role of humans will shift from being ""operators"" of daily tasks to ""orchestrators"" who oversee and adjust AI systems. Humans will monitor the progress of business operations and intervene or adjust when necessary. As advancements are made in areas like improved reasoning abilities, hallucination mitigation, and the reduction of ethical and privacy risks, human intervention will gradually become minimal. Furthermore, humans are expected to focus more on creative tasks that leverage their emotional intelligence, cognitive skills, and physical dexterity, working in collaboration with AI to expand these capabilities.
The rapid innovation of AI agent technology requires the financial services industry to set value-driven goals, enhance the necessary skills and capabilities, and establish a robust governance framework that includes change management and risk management. By making these preparations, we can realize a future in which humans and AI agents work together to shape the financial services of tomorrow.

Firms such as PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard could have direct benefits, while Charles Schwab and BlackRock could gain indirectly.
The passage of the Stablecoin Transparency and Accountability for a Better Ledger Economy (STABLE) Act would substantially benefit major regulated players in the US financial and crypto sectors, according to a Nansen report.
The firm highlighted that the STABLE Act’s licensing and reserve requirements create a regulatory moat favoring established institutions already aligned with US compliance standards.
Additionally, the report predicted that Coinbase could be among the biggest winners in crypto. As a major distributor of USDC and a partner of Circle, the exchange's model already fits the regulatory vision for fiat-backed stablecoins.
Coinbase’s custody and exchange operations may also see expanded demand for compliant storage solutions and increased liquidity consolidation.
The STABLE Act proposes establishing a comprehensive federal framework for payment stablecoins, restricting issuance to licensed entities, and requiring full backing with cash or short-term Treasury securities.
Advantages for TradFi and crypto firms
Payment companies such as PayPal, which issued PYUSD in collaboration with Paxos, are positioned to leverage new regulatory clarity to expand stablecoin-enabled payment services across peer-to-peer transfers, e-commerce, and cross-border transactions.
Visa and Mastercard, which previously piloted stablecoin settlement projects, could further integrate regulated stablecoins into B2B payments, treasury management, and real-time settlement layers.
Traditional custodians, including BNY Mellon and State Street, as well as infrastructure providers like Nasdaq, are poised to benefit from the demand for custody and compliance services. BNY Mellon’s relationship with Circle, managing USDC reserves, is a model for this emerging service line.
Meanwhile, asset managers, like BlackRock and Charles Schwab, are also expected to benefit indirectly. As regulated stablecoin issuers park reserves in government money market funds, these firms may see increased inflows. BlackRock, which already manages USDC reserves, could expand its role in this area.
Global and DeFi implications
The report notes that international firms such as Payoneer, MUFG, and Nomura may also benefit from using compliant stablecoin infrastructure for cross-border US dollar-denominated transfers.
In contrast, decentralized stablecoins such as DAI, crvUSD, and GHO, which do not meet the Act’s definition of payment stablecoins, face a diminished role within US markets. These tokens will likely shift activity offshore, explore legal workarounds, or operate in a regulatory gray zone.
The report expects lending protocols like Aave and Compound to adapt by prioritizing compliant stablecoins in their US offerings. At the same time, DEXs like Uniswap and Curve will need to geofence or de-emphasize pools tied to non-compliant assets.
The STABLE Act also bans direct interest payments to stablecoin holders, restricting yield-bearing stablecoins like the Origin Dollar (OUSD) unless they register as securities with the SEC.
As a result, the future stablecoin market may favor tokenized money market funds and compliant DeFi lending products."
