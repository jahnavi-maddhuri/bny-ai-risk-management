BNY has successfully piloted the first intraday repo trade settled through its triparty infrastructure.
The transaction took place between UBS and Swiss Re in February, where UBS borrowed cash from Swiss Re while delivering collateral through BNY's platform.
BNY says that the successful transaction marks the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo, where the allocation and return of collateral will be settled intraday against payment.
The tri-party solution also allows firms such as UBS to source liquidity at a specified time, without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period.
Gesa Johannsen, BNY's executive platform owner, global collateral, says: ""Our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
Jason Crosskey, head of EMEA funding and optimisation solutions at UBS, adds: “This facility enhances intraday capabilities by allowing institutions to provide or access cash at specific times to better manage liquidity.”

EXHIBIT #1: RISING VOLATILITY ACROSS THE G10 AND EM COMPLEX
Source: Source: BNY Markets, Bloomberg
Our take
Tariff uncertainty and heightened volatility have led to a surge of risk aversion. The sharp asset repricing has triggered some capitulation and the liquidation of trading patterns, with significant intraday volatility across asset classes in foreign exchange, equities and fixed income. This market stress can be observed in a widening of the cross-currency basis, a widening of credit spreads, including on higher-rated investment-grade corporate bonds, and greater equity and currency volatility. The volatility this week has been indiscriminate, with no currency or region spared. As shown in Exhibit #1, both emerging market and G7 currency volatilities have been moving in tandem compared with the more common differentiation of market volatility in a particular region. For example, emerging market FX was more volatile in Q4 2024, before being overtaken by the G7 region in the first quarter of this year. This situation was exacerbated by the response of the U.S. bond market. In contrast to the flight to quality bid on bonds, the U.S. Treasury curve bear steepened significantly, with 2-10y curve at 70bp, nearly 30bp steeper on the month, and 30y U.S. Treasurys hitting a high of 5% before settling around 40bp higher on the month.
This led to a surge in bond volatility, with the MOVE index, which measures U.S. bond market volatility, soaring past its November 2024 highs. Indeed, the MOVE index is at its highest level since September 2023, when the U.S. Federal Reserve telegraphed that it might keep rates higher for longer.
Forward look
At the time of writing, there is no sign of global trade tensions easing, with the U.S. imposing a record 125% import tariff on China, and China retaliating with tariffs as high as 84% on U.S. products. In response to U.S. tariffs, the European Union has approved retaliatory tariffs on around €21bn of U.S. goods, and Canada is reported to be imposing a 25% tariff on certain vehicle imports from the U.S. In other words, tariff uncertainty is here to stay, not to mention the risks of a further tightening of trade restriction in critical sectors.
EXHIBIT #2: EURO SCORED HOLDINGS
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Our take
The ECB policy meeting next week will be crucial for determining the direction of travel for the euro in the near term. ECB members seem to be shifting toward further rate cuts despite the less dovish tone at the March meeting, saying the trade war will have a “non-negligible” direct impact on the economy and warning about the disinflation threat from the euro’s strength. Euro appreciation this year has been spectacular, from testing 1.01 in early February to moving above 1.10 in April, a gain of nearly 6% year to date. Looking at the pricing dynamic of the euro in recent days, we have noticed an unusual dislocation, with EUR/USD going higher and a narrowing of the bond spread. The 2-year Eurozone and U.S. Treasury yield spread narrowed this week, driven by a lower Eurozone yield and a higher U.S. Treasury yield. This dislocation might continue for technical reasons but is typically not sustainable.
Forward look
Looking at iFlow, aggregate euro flows have been strong. iFlow data, especially from cross-border transactions, showed persistent short covering in Q1 2025, at almost as fast a pace as the liquidation that occurred in Q4 2024. As shown in Exhibit #2, euro scored holdings from cross-border investors, at around -1, are narrower than at the beginning of 2024. Looking at the euro as a whole, the currency’s high valuation might have resulted in some selling pressure. Indeed, iFlow showed weekly euro outflows for the first time this week after 11 straight weeks of inflows since mid-January 2025. Trading will continue to be volatile up ahead given the downside growth risk in the Eurozone, the direction of monetary policy and continued cross-border investor demand for the euro as a diversification play.
EXHIBIT #3: APAC WEEKLY AVERAGE SCORED FLOW
Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
Our take
The reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S. hit Asia hard, especially China, which was slapped with a minimum tariff of 125%. Most APAC countries face high reciprocal tariffs, with the exception of Singapore, which is subject to the minimum tariff of 10%. Other APAC countries saw high tariff rates, too, including Vietnam at 46%, followed by Thailand (36%), Taiwan and Indonesia (32%), India (26%), South Korea (25%), Malaysia (24%) and the Philippines (17%). Though there might be some consolation in the 90-day period for lower 10% reciprocal tariffs on non-retaliating countries, tariffs will likely pose significant downside growth risks to the region. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand has said that the tariffs imposed by the U.S. and any retaliatory levies by other nations will adversely impact domestic economic activity.
APAC equities have experienced severe market volatility in recent days, including a 13% selloff on the Hang Seng Index, the bourse’s largest one-day selloff since October 1997. And Taiwan equities recorded a decline of 10% on Monday, the biggest one-day drop on record. Foreign investor sentiment about equities has been bearish and shows no signs of improving. This was especially true in South Korea, where foreign investors have sold over $6bn in equities so far in April, more than the previous high of $5.7bn net sold in September 2024. Similar selling pressure can be seen across the APAC region, including in India and Taiwan.
APAC foreign exchange price action has been volatile as markets must navigate between risk-off and a capital outflow-triggered selloff against the softer U.S. dollar-induced rallies in foreign exchange. Capital outflows and uncertainty have won the argument. This and the loosening of the PBoC’s grip on the Chinese yuan have exacerbated the downside risk for Asian currencies. China’s official daily CNY fixings breached 7.20 this week, the first time since September 2023 and USDCNH reached historic highs this week, with an intraday high of 7.4290.
Forward look
In the context of the acute market uncertainty, capital outflows and negative market technical features, the selloff in APAC currencies over the past week has been relatively contained. Indeed, looking at iFlow, the weekly average scored flows for APAC currencies has been broadly positive, led by CNY, HKD, KRW and SGD, with outflows in MYR and IDR (see Exhibit #3). The observed inflows cannot be entirely explained by the unwinding of hedges, as overall investor flows in the government bond complex have been positive. One primary stabilizing force in the region, in our view, is the stepped-up smoothing activities by regional central banks, notably Bank Indonesia, which intervened in onshore IDR and offshore NDF. A similarly firm intervention stance can be seen in Taiwan, where USDTWD is kept firmly at a critical level of 33.0. While the pressure continues for APAC currencies, we do not expect depreciation momentum to be unhinged. We will continue to monitor asset flows as a swing factor for Asian currencies."

The pilot demonstrated the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo with a specified start and end time through BNY’s triparty platform – whereby the allocation and return of eligible collateral is settled and matured intraday against payment.
“We are continuously evolving BNY’s platform infrastructure to unlock new trading patterns for the market,” said Gesa Johannsen, executive platform owner, global collateral, BNY. “Complementing our new early morning maturity option for triparty transactions in the US, our intraday triparty repo solution is an important step towards providing more flexible liquidity management possibilities to our clients, enabling them to more efficiently fund their day-to-day operations.”
The intraday repo solution is designed to enable market participants to source liquidity for specified periods of time without the need to borrow for a full 24-hour period. For lenders, such as Swiss Re in this case, the solution can provide an opportunity to generate additional income on excess, idle cash.
Richard Hochreutiner, head of global collateral at Swiss Re, said: “This is a great way to deploy any otherwise dormant intraday cash and to contribute to market liquidity. Using BNY’s platform seamlessly builds on existing infrastructure and documentation.”
In April, Banco Santander and Rabobank also completed an intraday triparty repo transaction, executing trades in both directions — borrowing and lending — through BNY’s collateral platform.
In March, the custodian also announced a partnership with GLMX to enable buy-side clients to direct repo trades at the point of execution to BNY Mellon’s triparty platform.
The two firms said the integration comes off the back of growing demand from clients seeking to expand their BNY Mellon triparty usage beyond uncleared margin into repo financing, helping them to capture more benefits from being on the collateral platform."

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK) has successfully piloted the first intraday repo trade settled through its triparty infrastructure.
The USD-denominated pilot transaction, which took place in February, saw UBS borrowing cash from Swiss Re while delivering collateral via BNY’s global collateral platform.
The success of this pilot demonstrates the ability for market participants to instruct a same-day repo with a specified start and end time through BNY’s triparty infrastructure, whereby the allocation and return of eligible collateral is settled and matured intraday against payment. Additionally, market participants can access intraday repo through their existing triparty legal documentation on the BNY platform.

In April, Banco Santander and Rabobank also successfully completed an intraday triparty repo transaction, executing trades in both directions — borrowing and lending – through BNY’s collateral platform. Settling both legs of the repo trade intraday provided the parties with enhanced flexibility, streamlined collateral management, and improved short-term funding efficiency. As triparty agent, BNY provided the infrastructure, collateral servicing, and settlement support required to enable this trade.
“We are pleased to have collaborated on one of the first intraday triparty repo trades in both directions,” said Enrique Verdu, Managing Director – Securities Finance, Banco Santander. “This represents meaningful progress in how we can manage and optimize intraday liquidity.”
“There is clear appetite from market participants like Rabobank for more dynamic and efficient short-term funding solutions,” added Allan Bolk, European Head – Securities Finance and Repo, Rabobank. “Executing both sides of the transaction intraday through a triparty setup delivers valuable optionality and operational ease.”"

eToro is working with BNY, which will act as the custodian, and stock lending platform EquiLend, which will identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+ and Diamond Club members, followed at a later date by lower-tier Club members.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way. Yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets. Leveraging BNY’s Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,” said Yossi Brandes, VP Execution Services at eToro.
Eligible eToro users will be given the option to opt into the programme, at which point their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending. Once opted in, they will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earned in the specific period.
Only whole unit ‘real’ stock positions are eligible for lending, meaning that CFDs and fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share. Stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
eToro users who lend their stock temporarily give ownership of the stocks to the borrower and lose voting rights while the stock is on loan. However, they can still receive dividends, sell the stocks or opt out of the programme at any time at no cost.
This launch of stock lending represents an expansion of the growing clearing relationship between eToro and BNY which leverages BNY’s Global Clearing platform, offering integrated solutions across US and international clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing. Through a jointly-created value proposition, the firms have developed a scalable global operating model enabling eToro’s underlying client base to access over 19 exchanges globally.
Yossi Brandes adds: “Since the inception of our relationship, BNY has enabled us to expand our offering of investment opportunities through their global clearing and custody services, which provide the financial structure for our global, fully funded stock and ETF offerings across 19 exchanges. This new collaboration marks a significant step in our commitment to adding features and products to the platform that enrich the investing experience and help users to grow their knowledge and wealth.”
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with eToro, supporting a holistic solution set across clearing, settlement, custody, foreign exchange, cash management. This development represents the very best of eToro, Equilend and the heritage and innovation of BNY’s world-class platform, as investors look to access a cutting edge feature in their investing journey,” said Victor O’Laughlen, Head of Global Clearing at BNY.
“The collaboration between EquiLend Spire and eToro marks a significant advancement in the securities lending market, enabling eToro to enhance its services with a fully paid lending program that benefits from cutting-edge technology. This move not only demonstrates EquiLend Spire’s commitment to innovation but also eToro’s dedication to providing efficient and modern financial solutions to its users,” said Dan Dougherty, Managing Director, Global Head of Sales & Account Management at EquiLend.

Source: BNY Markets, iFlow
By announcing sweeping tariffs, the U.S. is fundamentally changing its role in the global trading order. There are also uncertainties about the relative attractiveness of U.S. financial assets to overseas investors. It’s only been a few days since the tariff announcement on April 1, and the volatility of financial assets may obscure clear conclusions at this early stage, but early implications shed some light on how international investors are treating U.S. equities, Treasurys and the dollar. Initial conclusions suggest an air of caution in cross-border investment flows.
Let’s start with equities. We have argued, with evidence (see here, for example), that there is waning demand for U.S. equities following a long period of outperformance through most of the post-pandemic period. Until late last year, that is. As Exhibit #1 shows, U.S. equity holdings have been in almost steady decline since early December last year. Our 2025 annual outlook foreshadowed an end to so-called American exceptionalism, and we have indeed observed this phenomenon quite clearly. While U.S. holdings have declined since the end of last year, there has been a clear shift in equity allocations to Europe. Of course, there has been an appreciable drawdown in equity exposure across the world since tariffs were announced, as both U.S. and Eurozone equities have repriced lower on the news.
Again, we emphasize that it’s too early after the tariff storm has been unleashed to extrapolate short-term movements into long-term trends, but this is one that has persisted for a while, and one which makes a lot of sense. U.S. valuations had become stretched and market depth narrow, while growth prospects abroad were less ebullient – to say the least – than in the U.S. However, with tariff uncertainty now at its apex, and the effects on the U.S. relative the rest of the world equally uncertain, the unique attractiveness of U.S. assets is significantly diminished.
EXHIBIT #2: WHERE HAVE CROSS-BORDER INVESTORS GONE?

Overseas demand for U.S. Treasurys has been a key concern of ours, and something we watch closely. Exhibit #2 shows cumulative daily flows (a way of measuring longer-term movements in underlying demand) since the beginning of 2024. As the chart shows, outside of the resolution of the 2024 debt ceiling episode, when cross-border investors piled into new T-bill issuance, flows have been mixed at best over this period. Note, in particular, over the same period – early December last year – when equity flows left the U.S. and headed into the Eurozone, U.S. Treasury flows have been generally underwater.
U.S. fiscal uncertainty is one plausible explanation, and again something we have been concerned about since the election. Extending the 2017 tax cuts will cost an estimated $4.5trn over the next 10 years, and it’s not clear that tariffs and budget cuts can offset the red ink from this policy. Static analysis suggests around $600bn per year will be raised from tariff revenues, but changing import behavior, declining domestic demand for higher priced and harder-to-source imports, and changing trade patterns could lead to merely half (or less) of that annual revenue actually being realized.
Yields on bonds outside the United States are competitive. Furthermore, fixed income investors typically hedge their overseas sovereign exposure back to local currency. Hedging costs for covering UST investments back into euros, for example are now at their highest level since mid-2022, at 2.1% reduce the overall take-home yield on, say, a 10y US T-note paying 4.2% by around half, whereas 10y German Bunds currently yield 2.6% in local terms, without the bother and volatility of hedging.
This is not to say that safe haven buying of USTs will no longer take place during times of market stress, and undoubtedly, the move in the 10y yield to below 4% at the end of last week was at least partially the result of a flight to safety. We have daily data on UST flows from abroad, shown in Exhibit #3. Thursday, April 3, the day after the tariff announcement, saw one of the biggest one-day inflows from abroad in several years. However, within a day, this flow had almost fully reversed and by yesterday was slightly negative. Total (i.e., cross-border and local) flows were still quite high on Friday, April 4 and Monday, April 7, but the absence of significant cross-border flow suggests it was primarily from U.S.-based investors.
EXHIBIT #3: A ONE-DAY RUSH INTO SAFE HAVENS, BUT PRECIOUS LITTLE OTHERWISE

These data are of great importance and something we monitor constantly. Tuesday’s barely passing 3-year auction and upcoming additional coupon placements the rest of this week could be illustrative of overall cross-border demand. The upcoming budget debate is also key, as we try to account for any increases in the deficit over the next several years. Our bias is to expect more – not less – red ink, potentially crimping demand from abroad."

eToro announced today (Thursday) the launch of a stock lending program that will allow its users in the UK and Europe to earn passive income by lending their stocks to borrowers. The Israeli fintech is thus following in the footsteps of its competitors in the online retail trading market, including Robinhood, which has been offering similar solutions for some time.
Passive Income with eToro
The initiative represents a significant expansion of eToro's existing relationship with BNY, which will act as the custodian for the new offering. Stock lending platform EquiLend will identify potential borrowers and facilitate the lending process.
“Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions and it's been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way,” said Yossi Brandes, VP of Execution Services at eToro.
“Leveraging BNY's Global Clearing services, we want to level the playing field by enabling millions of eToro users across the UK and Europe to engage with stock lending in an easy and transparent way,” he added.
The program will initially be available to higher-tier eToro Club members—those with Platinum, Platinum+, and Diamond status—before being extended to other users at a later date.
eToro has been in the spotlight recently due to its planned IPO on Nasdaq under the ticker ETOR. The latest market disruption caused by Donald Trump's tariff announcements has led the company to pause its IPO roadshows as it “evaluates market conditions.”
How It Works
Users who choose to participate must opt in, after which their entire portfolio of eligible stock positions will be considered for lending. Only whole unit “real” stock positions qualify. CFDs and fractional shares are excluded.
Participating users will receive monthly statements tracking their income when their stocks are successfully loaned out. Securities with low market liquidity, high volatility, and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings.
While stocks are on loan, users temporarily transfer ownership to borrowers and forfeit voting rights. However, they continue to receive dividends and retain the ability to sell their stocks or opt out of the program at any time without incurring costs.
How Mach Can You Earn
While not explicitly detailed in the initial announcement, eToro has provided a formula in its help center for calculating potential earnings.
“Participants will receive monthly payments, equivalent to 50% of the net revenue eToro earns and receives from our partners for these lending transactions. The actual income from stock lending will likely vary from month to month depending on the market demand for the stock,” eToro explains in their FAQ.
The final values will depend on which assets are lent, the number of shares, and the variable lending fee, which fluctuates due to market supply and demand.
In eToro's example, they indicate that the lending fee rate is 1%, the facilitation and maintenance cost is 15%, and eToro's revenue share is 50% (remember those values are not fixed). The example referenced a relatively substantial investment of 2,000 Tesla shares at a price of $350 each, totaling $700,000. How much does eToro offer for a loan lasting 112 days (nearly 4 months) with this amount? Just over $925.
Is that a lot? Considering that the funds are already tied up in stocks, it's certainly a nice bonus and additional “dividend” from owning shares. However, for retail investors with typically much smaller portfolios, the profits will likely be rather symbolic.
For comparison, the stock lending program introduced by Swissquote, which has been functioning since 2024, offers an annual interest rate of over 5% for selected, most popular stocks. However, looking at Robinhood's offering, which implemented a similar solution in 2022, the terms are very comparable. The same applies to the Stock Yield Enhancement Program (SYEP) Derivatives introduced by Interactive Brokers in 2023.
Therefore, it can be concluded that eToro is not deviating from market averages in this regard.
Expanding Financial Access
Through BNY's Global Clearing platform, eToro's users can access over 19 exchanges globally, with integrated solutions for clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing.
“We are pleased to expand our relationship with eToro, supporting a holistic solution set across clearing, settlement, custody, foreign exchange, cash management,” Victor O'Laughlen, Head of Global Clearing at BNY, commented on the expansion. “This development represents the very best of eToro, Equilend and the heritage and innovation of BNY's world-class platform.”
eToro is providing educational resources on its platform to help users understand potential income opportunities and risks associated with stock lending.
Dan Dougherty, Managing Director, Global Head of Sales & Account Management at EquiLend, noted that the collaboration “marks a significant advancement in the securities lending market,” enabling eToro to enhance its services with a fully paid lending program.
The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has issued guidance noting that while securities lending may generate extra returns, it can also introduce additional risks, including counterparty and collateral shortfall risk. The authority unveiled some measures in 2023 to curb securities lending to retail investors.
As FinanceMagnates.com informed this week, Shir Shalom, who led various projects related to risk management at eToro, has announced her departure from the financial trading platform after serving nearly four years in various leadership roles. “Forever an eTorian,” she wrote on her socials."

Trading and investing platform eToro has expanded its relationship with BNY to launch a fully-paid stock lending programme, enabling Europe-based users to earn passive income.
BNY will act as the custodian, while EquiLend Spire will identify borrowers and facilitate the stock lending process.
Yossi Brandes, vice president of execution services at eToro, comments: “Stock lending has traditionally been the preserve of large financial institutions, and it’s been much harder for retail investors to earn passive income in this way. Yet it is an important practice that helps to support liquidity in financial markets.”
The feature will be rolled out gradually to members of the eToro Club, starting with Platinum, Platinum+, and Diamond Club members, followed by lower-tier club members at a later date.
Eligible users will be given the option to opt into the programme, at which point their entire portfolio of stock positions will be considered for lending.
Once opted in, users will begin receiving monthly statements if their stock is successfully lent to keep track of the income they earned in the specific period.
Only whole unit ‘real’ stock positions are eligible for lending, meaning that contracts for difference (CFDs) and fractional shares are excluded, with eligible shares rounded down to the nearest whole share.
Stocks with low market liquidity, high volatility, and high demand are more likely to be borrowed and generate higher earnings, according to eToro, with loaned-out stocks backed by collateral.
This launch of stock lending represents an expansion of the growing clearing relationship between eToro and BNY, which utilises BNY’s Global Clearing platform, offering integrated solutions across US and international clearing, custody, settlement, execution, and financing.
Brandes adds: “Since the inception of our relationship, BNY has enabled us to expand our offering of investment opportunities through their global clearing and custody services, which provide the financial structure for our global, fully funded stock and ETF offerings across 19 exchanges.
“This new collaboration marks a significant step in our commitment to adding features and products to the platform that enrich the investing experience and help users to grow their knowledge and wealth.”
