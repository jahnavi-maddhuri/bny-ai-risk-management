from the anticipated results expressed or implied in
these forward-looking statements as a result of a

• a cybersecurity incident, or a failure in our
computer systems, networks and information, or

impacted, and will in the future continue to
impact, our profitability and capital levels, at
times adversely;

conditions, reducing our capital levels and/or
earnings;

business;
• we could incur losses if our allowance for credit
losses, including loan and lending-related
commitment reserves, is inadequate or if our
expectations of future economic conditions
deteriorate;

• our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected if we do
not effectively manage our liquidity;
• failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more
generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our business and
financial condition;

and, as a result, is dependent on dividends from
its subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its
IHC to meet its obligations, including with
respect to its securities, and to provide funds for
share repurchases, payment of income taxes and
payment of dividends to its stockholders;

material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations and on the
value of the securities we issue;

strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly
liquidation authority could adversely affect the
Parent’s liquidity and financial condition and the

failure to implement these initiatives could affect
our results of operations;

uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of
operations;

benefits of our transition to a platforms operating
model;

terrorism, war, natural disasters, the physical
effects of climate change, pandemics and other
similar events may have a negative impact on our

ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Description of Business
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a
global company headquartered in New York, New
York, with $52.1 trillion in assets under custody and/
or administration and $2.0 trillion in assets under

subsidiaries, BNY has been in business since 1784.
We divide our businesses into three principal business
segments: Securities Services, Market and Wealth
Services and Investment and Wealth Management.
We also have an Other segment, which includes the
leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities
(including our securities portfolio), derivatives and
other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life
insurance, tax credit investments and other corporate
investments and certain business exits.
For a further discussion of BNY’s lines of business,

section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is
incorporated herein by reference, for a description of
how to access financial and other information
regarding BNY.
Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in
trust and custody activities, investment management
services, banking services and various securitiesrelated activities. Our two principal U.S. banking
subsidiaries are:
• The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York
state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities
Services businesses, including Asset Servicing
and Issuer Services and certain Market and
Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury
Services and Clearance and Collateral
Management, as well as the bank-advised
business of Investment Management; and
• BNY Mellon, National Association (“BNY
Mellon, N.A.”), a national bank, which houses
our Wealth Management business and certain
activities of our Pershing businesses.
We have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company
subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and
services across the United States: The Bank of New
York Mellon Trust Company, National Association,
BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon
Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY
Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our
Investment Management business and Pershing
businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries
of BNY.
Each of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is
subject to regulation by the applicable bank
regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S.
banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided
by law.
BNY’s banking subsidiaries outside the United States
are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory
authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”).
The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV (“BNY SA/
NV”) is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of
New York Mellon in continental Europe. It is
authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the
European Central Bank and the National Bank of
Belgium under the Single Supervisory Mechanism

Services and Markets Authority for conduct of

Annual Report.
Primary Subsidiaries
Exhibit 21.1 to this Form 10-K presents a list of
BNY’s primary subsidiaries as of Dec. 31, 2024.
PART I
BNY 5
Human Capital Management
Our enduring ambition is to build the best global team
—one that includes varying perspectives,
backgrounds and experiences, and reflects the
increasingly varied markets and clients we serve. Our
core objective is to empower our teams to do their
best work, make unique contributions and build
purposeful careers in an environment where they are
treated with fairness, dignity and respect.
Belonging
Belonging is integral to who we are as a company,
what our people experience as members of our global
team, and how we serve all of our stakeholders. Our
strategy is not separate, it includes all of our
employees and is embedded in the way we do
business, our operating model, talent experience and
client value proposition.
At the end of 2024, women represented 40% of
BNY’s global workforce and 43% of BNY’s U.S.
workforce. Further, 39% of BNY’s U.S. workforce
were from U.S. underrepresented ethnic and/or racial
backgrounds.
At the end of 2024, 43% of BNY’s Executive
Committee were women and 26% of BNY’s
Executive Committee were from underrepresented
ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.
At the end of 2024, 45% of our Board of Directors
were women and 27% of our Board of Directors was
composed of individuals from underrepresented
ethnic and/or racial backgrounds.
Retention, Training and Development
We seek to attract and retain employees by providing
a rewarding employee experience. We recognize that
employees seek a supportive and safe workplace, and
we continually evaluate our employee engagement
and wellbeing programs in an effort to meet those
expectations. We offer a 401(k) plan for U.S.
employees and other defined contribution retirement
plans worldwide, where consistent with market
practice. We also maintain defined benefit plans for
certain current and former employees, some of which
are frozen (including in the U.S.). At Dec. 31, 2024,
we had approximately 41,500 participants in our
401(k) plan, including former employees. In
addition, our frozen U.S. defined benefit pension plan
covered approximately 6,400 U.S. participants, and
our non-U.S. defined benefit plans (some frozen)
covered approximately 18,400 non-U.S. participants.
In 2024, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
again provided eligible employees an award of 10
restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or “BK Shares”. BK
Shares is an equity grant that allows for eligible
employees to become equity owners, or increase their
equity holdings in the Company, and share in the
Company’s success.
At key career transition points, from internship to
executive management, we offer programs and
development opportunities to help employees
advance their careers and progress within our
organization. Our extensive training and
development opportunities are designed to enable
employees to grow professionally and advance within
our organization.
We engage with employees to encourage innovation,
show appreciation for their contributions, and gather
feedback on how we can build a more rewarding,
inclusive workplace. For example, we regularly
gather feedback through an all-employee survey.
Employee Wellbeing, Health and Safety
BNY’s holistic approach to employee wellbeing is
designed to create a healthy, resilient and vibrant
workforce. Our programs are designed to provide
employees access to resources to help improve their
physical health, emotional resilience, financial
wellbeing and social connections. Further, we work
to ensure the safety of our employees and clients in
all of our facilities.
BNY fosters a high-performance culture and supports
employee work/life balance, while also delivering on
our regulatory requirements and business imperatives.
We endeavor to promote a collaborative and effective
workplace for our people, while continuing to
embrace the concept of flexibility and enhancing our
culture and commercial impact.
Employees and International Operations
Globally, at Dec. 31, 2024, BNY and its subsidiaries
had approximately 51,800 full-time employees.
We pride ourselves on providing dedicated service
through our multilingual sales, marketing and client
6 BNY
service teams. At Dec. 31, 2024, approximately 60%
of our total employees (full-time and part-time
employees) were based outside the U.S., with
approximately 10,900 employees in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), approximately
18,900 employees in the Asia-Pacific region
(“APAC”) and approximately 800 employees in other
global locations, primarily Brazil.
Supervision and Regulation
Information on the supervision and regulation of
BNY can be found in the “MD&A – Supervision and
Regulation” section in the Annual Report, which is
incorporated herein by reference.
Competition
BNY is subject to competition in all aspects and areas
of our business. Our Securities Services and Market
and Wealth Services businesses compete with
domestic and international financial services firms
that offer custody services, corporate trust services,
clearing services, collateral management services,
credit services, securities brokerage, foreign exchange
services, derivatives, depositary receipt services and
integrated cash management solutions and related
products, as well as a wide range of technology
service providers, such as financial services data
processing firms. Our Investment and Wealth
Management business competes with domestic and
international investment management and wealth
management firms, hedge funds, investment banking
companies and other financial services companies,
including trust banks, brokerage firms and insurance
companies, as well as a wide range of technology
service providers.
Competition in the financial services industry
continues to be intense. Competition is based on a
number of factors including, among others, customer
service and convenience, transaction execution,
capital or access to capital, quality and range of
products and services offered, performance,
technological innovation and expertise, including
adaptation to technological change, price, reputation
and lending limits. Competition also varies based on
the types of clients, customers, industries and
geographies served. Our ability to continue to
compete effectively also depends in large part on our
ability to attract new employees, retain, develop and
motivate our existing employees, amid heightened
regulatory restrictions and an inflationary or uncertain
interest rate environment. Our competitive position
may be affected by institutions that are not similarly
subject to extensive regulation, such as financial
technology firms, and as further technological
advances enable more companies, such as financial
technology firms, to provide financial services.
For additional discussion regarding competition, see
“MD&A – Risk Factors – Operational Risk – Our
business may be adversely affected if we are unable
to attract, retain, develop and motivate employees”
and “MD&A – Risk Factors – Strategic Risk – We
are subject to competition in all aspects of our
business, which could negatively affect our ability to
maintain or increase our profitability” in the Annual
Report, which are incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with
participation by the members of the Disclosure
Committee, has responsibility for ensuring that there
is an adequate and effective process for establishing,
maintaining, and evaluating disclosure controls and
procedures that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in our SEC
reports is timely recorded, processed, summarized
and reported and that information required to be
disclosed by BNY is accumulated and communicated
to BNY’s management to allow timely decisions
regarding the required disclosure. In addition, our
ethics hotline can be used by employees and others
for the anonymous communication of concerns about
financial controls or reporting matters. There are
inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system
of disclosure controls and procedures, including the
possibility of human error and the circumvention or
overriding of the controls and procedures.
Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and
procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of
achieving their control objectives.
As of Dec. 31, 2024, an evaluation was carried out
under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the
Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were effective.

Exhibit 4.2
THE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION
DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES REGISTERED PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2024
The following is a summary description of each class of securities of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation (the “Company”) that is registered under Section 12 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”).
The following summary is not complete. It is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the
pertinent sections of the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (including, but not limited to,
the Series A Certificate of Designations (as defined below)), and Amended and Restated By-Laws, each of which
are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and to the applicable provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”) and federal law governing bank holding companies.
DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK
General
The Company is authorized to issue 3,500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
“Common Stock”). The Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BK.”
The rights of holders of Common Stock are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of
holders of any of the Company’s preferred stock that have been issued and may be issued in the future.
Dividends
The holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive dividends, when, as and if declared by the Company’s
board of directors out of any funds legally available therefor, subject to the preferences applicable to any
outstanding preferred stock.
The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its Common Stock:
• depends primarily upon the ability of its subsidiaries, including The Bank of New York Mellon,
BNY Mellon, National Association and Pershing LLC, to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to
it;
• is subject to policies established by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “Federal Reserve”).
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Supervision and Regulation—Capital Planning and Stress Testing—Payment of Dividends, Stock
Repurchases and Other Capital Distributions” and Part I, “Item 1. Business—Supervision and
Regulation” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K; and
• will be prohibited, subject to certain restrictions, in the event that the Company does not declare and
pay in full preferred dividends for the then-current dividend period of its Series A Noncumulative
Preferred Stock, $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) or the last
preceding dividend period of its Series F Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $100,000
liquidation preference per share (the “Series F Preferred Stock”), its Series G Noncumulative Perpetual
Preferred Stock, $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the “Series G Preferred Stock”), its Series H
Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $100,000 liquidation preference per share (the “Series H 
Preferred Stock”) and its Series I Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, $100,000 liquidation
preference per share (the “Series I Preferred Stock”).
Voting
Holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters as to which
shareholders are entitled to vote. The holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights.
In any uncontested election of directors, each director will be elected under a majority voting standard as
opposed to a plurality voting standard. Under a majority voting standard, a nominee for director is elected if the
votes cast “for” such nominee’s election exceed the votes cast “against” such nominee’s election (with
“abstentions” not counted as a vote cast either “for” or “against” that director’s election). A plurality standard will
apply in any contested election of directors, which is an election in which the number of nominees for director
exceeds the number of directors to be elected. Under the Company’s Corporate Governance Guidelines, in an
election of directors, any incumbent director who fails to receive more “for” votes than “against” votes in any
uncontested election must tender his or her resignation to the independent Chair or Lead Director (or such other
director designated by the Company’s board of directors if the director failing to receive the majority of votes cast is
the independent Chair or Lead Director) promptly after the certification of the stockholder vote. The matter will
then be referred to the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Social Responsibility Committee. The Corporate
Governance, Nominating and Social Responsibility Committee will promptly consider the tendered resignation and
recommend to the Company’s board of directors whether to accept or reject it, or whether other action should be
taken. If, because of recusals, the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Social Responsibility Committee is
unable to meet and consider the issue with a quorum of its members participating in the discussion, the Company’s
board of directors may assign the issue to another committee consisting solely of independent directors. The
Corporate Governance, Nominating and Social Responsibility Committee (or other committee to which the matter is
assigned) will consider whatever factors its members deem relevant, including, without limitation, the stated reasons
for the “against” votes, the length of service and qualifications of any incumbent director whose resignation has
been tendered, the incumbent director’s contributions to the Company, and the mix of skills and backgrounds on the
Company’s board of directors. The board of directors will act on the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Social
Responsibility Committee’s recommendation (or the recommendation of such other committee to which the matter
is assigned) no later than 90 days following the certification of the election in question, considering the factors
considered by the committee (or such other committee) and such additional information and factors as it deems
relevant. Following the decision by the Company’s board of directors, the Company will publicly disclose such
decision (and, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation) in a Current Report on Form 8-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. If the board of directors does not accept the director’s
resignation, it may elect to address the underlying stockholder concern or to take such other actions as it deems
appropriate and in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. A director who tenders his or her
resignation pursuant to the above-described Corporate Governance Guidelines will not vote on the issue of whether
his or her tendered resignation will be accepted or rejected. If the board of directors accepts an incumbent director’s
resignation pursuant to the above-described Corporate Governance Guidelines, or if a nominee for director is not
elected and the nominee is not an incumbent director, then the board of directors may fill the resulting vacancy
pursuant to the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws.
Liquidation Rights
Upon liquidation of the Company, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive pro rata the net assets of
the Company after satisfaction in full of the prior rights of creditors of the Company (including holders of the
Company’s debt securities) and holders of any of the Company’s preferred stock.
Miscellaneous
Holders of Common Stock do not have any preferential or preemptive right with respect to any securities of
the Company or any conversion rights. The Common Stock is not subject to redemption. The outstanding shares of
Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable.
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. is the Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Common Stock.
Computershare, Inc. is the Dividend Disbursement Agent for the Common Stock.

Certain Provisions of Delaware Law and the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws
The Company is also subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Section 203 prohibits the Company from
engaging in any business combination (as defined in Section 203) with an “interested stockholder” for a period of
three years subsequent to the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless:
• prior to such date, the board of directors of the Company approves either the business combination or
the transaction in which the stockholder became an interested stockholder;
• upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder,
the interested stockholder owns at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock (with certain exclusions);
or
• the business combination is approved by the Company’s board of directors and authorized by a vote
(and not by written consent) of at least 66 2/3% of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the
interested stockholder.
For purposes of Section 203, an “interested stockholder” is defined as an entity or person beneficially
owning 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, based on voting power, and any entity or person
affiliated with or controlling or controlled by such an entity or person.
A “business combination” includes mergers, asset sales and other transactions resulting in financial benefit
to a stockholder. Section 203 could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control attempts with
respect to the Company and, accordingly, may discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market
price for the shares held by stockholders.
Such provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control of
management or the Company.
Under the provisions of Section 203, a corporation can expressly elect not to be governed by the business
combination provisions in its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated By-Laws, but, as of
the date of this report, the Company has not done so.
The Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws establish advance notice procedures with regards to
proposals by stockholders to be brought before a meeting of stockholders and for nominations by stockholders of
candidates for election as directors. In general, written notice must be received by the Secretary of the Company:
• for proposals by stockholders to be brought before a meeting of stockholders in the case of an annual
meeting, not less than 90 calendar days or more than 120 calendar days before the anniversary date of
the Company’s proxy statement released to the stockholders in connection with the previous year’s
annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30
calendar days from the date of the most recent previous annual meeting, notice by the stockholder will
be timely if it is received (A) on or before the later of (1) 120 calendar days before the date of the
annual meeting at which such business is to be presented, or (2) 10 calendar days following the first
public announcement by the Company of the annual meeting date and (B) not later than 15 calendar
days prior to the scheduled mailing date of the Company’s proxy materials for that annual meeting;
• for nominations of candidates to be properly brought before a meeting by a stockholder for the election
of directors, (i) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than 90 calendar days or more than 120
calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the previous year’s annual meeting; provided, however,
that in the event that the date of the annual meeting at which directors are to be elected is more than 30
calendar days from the date of the most recent previous annual meeting, notice by the stockholder of
intent to make a nomination for director will be timely if it is received (A) on or before the later of (1)
120 calendar days before the date of the annual meeting at which such business is to be presented or
such election is to take place, as the case may be, or (2) 30 calendar days following the first public
announcement by the Company of the annual meeting date and (B) not later than 15 calendar days prior
3
to the scheduled mailing date of the Company’s proxy materials for that annual meeting or (ii) in the
case of a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, not later than the close of
business on the tenth calendar day following the earlier of the day on which notice of the meeting date
was mailed and the day on which public announcement of the meeting date was made.
The notice associated with a stockholder nominee for the board of directors must also provide certain
information, questionnaires, representations and agreements and be updated and supplemented as set forth in the
Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws. A stockholder that complies with the procedures set forth in the
Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws and the Exchange Act, including Rule 14a-8 thereunder, would be
permitted to nominate individual(s) for the board of directors at a stockholders meeting, and any stockholder may
vote in person or by proxy for any individual who has been nominated in accordance with the Company’s Amended
and Restated By-Laws. In addition, the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws permit a stockholder, or a
group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of the outstanding Common Stock continuously for at least
three years, to nominate and include in the Company’s proxy materials for an annual meeting directors constituting
up to two individuals or 20% of the board of directors, whichever is greater, provided that the stockholder(s) and the
nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws. Further, the
Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws establish that the Company need not present and may disregard a
stockholder nomination if the proposing stockholder fails to meet applicable requirements, including the failure to
meet the requirements under the Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws or Rule 14a-19 of the Exchange Act,
or failure of the stockholder or qualified representative to appear at such meeting to present the nomination.
The Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws set forth the information that must be provided in
connection with any proposal by stockholders to be brought before a meeting of the stockholders. In general, the
advance notice of the stockholder’s proposal must set forth a description of the business that the stockholder intends
to bring before the meeting, including the text of the proposal, and certain information regarding the proposing
stockholder, including the name and address of the stockholder, the classes and numbers of shares of the Company’s
capital stock beneficially owned by each such stockholder, a representation that such stockholder is and will at the
time of the annual meeting be a holder of record of the Company’s capital stock who is entitled to vote at the
meeting on the date of the meeting and that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting
to present such proposal(s), the name and address of any beneficial owners of the Company’s stock on whose behalf
such business is to be presented, the reasons for conducting the business at the meeting and any material interest of
the stockholder or any such beneficial owner in such business proposed at the meeting, information on any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (including any hedging, derivative, or other similar transactions,
regardless of the form of settlement) that is in place or has been entered into by or for the benefit of such
stockholder or any such beneficial owner with respect to the Company’s securities, debt instruments or credit
ratings within the prior six months preceding the date of delivery of the stockholder’s notice, the effect or intent of
which transaction is to give rise to gain or loss as a result of changes in the trading price of such securities or debt
instruments or changes in the credit ratings of the Company or to increase or decrease the voting power of such
stockholder or any such beneficial owner, and if so, a summary of the material terms thereof, and a representation
that the stockholder or any such beneficial owner intends, or is part of a group that intends to deliver a proxy
statement to and solicit proxies from stockholders of at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of
capital stock required under applicable law to approve the proposal or otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in
support of such proposal in compliance with applicable legal requirements.
The Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws provide stockholders holding an aggregate “net long
position” (as defined in the Amended and Restated By-Laws) representing at least 20% of the outstanding Common
Stock the right to request that the Secretary of the Company call a special meeting of stockholders. The Company’s
Amended and Restated By-Laws also set forth the requirements and procedures of such a stockholder special
meeting request, including with respect to (i) when multiple requests will be considered together, (ii) the
information required when submitting a request, (iii) limitations on when requests may be made, (iv) the time for
holding a special meeting following a request and (v) the appropriate scope of business at any meeting held pursuant
to a request.
The Company’s Amended and Restated By-Laws also provide that vacancies on the board of directors may
only be filled by a majority of directors then in office, except that those vacancies resulting from removal from
4
office by a vote of the stockholders may be filled by a vote of the stockholders at the same meeting at which such
removal occurs.

DESCRIPTION OF THE 6.244% FIXED-TO-FLOATING RATE NORMAL PREFERRED CAPITAL
SECURITIES OF MELLON CAPITAL IV (FULLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY GUARANTEED BY THE
BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION) AND THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK
Description of the 6.244% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Preferred Capital Securities
General
The 6.244% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Normal Preferred Capital Securities (“PCS”) are beneficial interests in
Mellon Capital IV, a Delaware statutory trust (the “Trust”) organized pursuant to the Amended and Restated Trust
Agreement (the “Trust Agreement”) among the Company, Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company, as the
property trustee (the “Property Trustee”), M&T Trust Company of Delaware, as the Delaware trustee (the
“Delaware Trustee”), the administrative trustees, who are employees or officers of, or affiliated with, the Company
and the several holders of the Trust securities.
The Trust will pass through, as distributions on or the redemption price of PCS, amounts that it receives on
its assets that are the “corresponding assets” for the PCS. The corresponding asset for each PCS is a 1/100th, or a
$1,000, interest in one share of Series A Preferred Stock.
PCS
Holders of PCS are entitled to receive distributions corresponding to non-cumulative dividends on the
Series A Preferred Stock held by the Trust. The Trust must make distributions on the PCS on the relevant
distribution dates to the extent that it has funds available therefor. The Trust’s funds available for distribution to a
holder of PCS will be limited to payments received from the Company on the assets held by the Trust corresponding
to the PCS. The Company guarantees the payment of distributions on the PCS out of moneys held by the Trust to
the extent of available Trust funds, as described under “Description of the Guarantee” below. The distribution dates
for PCS are each March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20, or if any such day is not a business day, the
next succeeding business day.
Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will be payable if, as and when declared by the Company’s
board of directors, on March 20, June 20, September 20 and December 20 of each year (each, a “Dividend Payment
Date”) (or if such day is not a business day, the immediately succeeding business day).
Dividends on each share of Series A Preferred Stock will be calculated on the liquidation preference of
$100,000 per share for each related Dividend Period (as defined below) at a rate per annum equal to the greater of
(x) from and including September 2023, three-month CME Term SOFR (as defined below) (plus a spread
adjustment of 0.26161%) plus 0.565% and (y) 4.000%.
Mandatory Redemption of PCS upon Redemption of Series A Preferred Stock
The PCS have no stated maturity but must be redeemed on the date the Company redeems the Series A
Preferred Stock, and the Property Trustee or paying agent will apply the proceeds from such repayment or
redemption to redeem a like amount of the PCS. The Series A Preferred Stock is perpetual but the Company may, at
its option, redeem it in whole at any time or in part from time to time, subject to certain limitations. The redemption
price per PCS will equal the redemption price of the Series A Preferred Stock. See “Description of the Series A
Preferred Stock—Redemption” below. If notice of redemption of any Series A Preferred Stock has been duly given
and if on or before the redemption date specified in the redemption notice all funds necessary for the redemption
have been set aside by the Company in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of any shares of Series A
Preferred Stock called for redemption, then, on and after the redemption date, such shares of Series A Preferred
Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders with respect to such shares (including the
right to receive any dividends) will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price without interest.
6
If less than all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by the Trust are to be redeemed on a
redemption date, then the proceeds from such redemption will be allocated pro rata to the PCS being redeemed and
the common securities issued to the Company by the Trust (the “Trust Common Securities”), except as set forth
under “—Ranking of Trust Common Securities” below.
The term “like amount” as used above means PCS having a liquidation amount equal to that portion of the
liquidation amount of the Series A Preferred Stock to be contemporaneously redeemed, the proceeds of which will
be used to pay the redemption price of such PCS.
Redemption Procedures
Notice of any redemption will be mailed by the Property Trustee at least 30 days but not more than 60 days
before the redemption date to the registered address of each holder of PCS to be redeemed.
Each notice shall state:
• the redemption date;
• estimate of the redemption price together with a statement that it is an estimate and that the actual
Redemption Price will be calculated on the third Business Day prior to the Redemption Date (and if an
estimate is provided, a further notice shall be sent of the actual Redemption Price on the date that such
Redemption Price is calculated);
• if less than all of the outstanding PCS are to be redeemed, the identification and the total liquidation
amount of the particular PCS to be redeemed;
• that on the redemption date, the redemption price will become due and payable upon each PCS to be
redeemed and distributions thereon will cease to accumulate on and after said date; and
• if the PCS are not held in book-entry on the redemption date, the place or places where certificates for
the PCS are to be surrendered for payment of the redemption price.
If (i) the Trust gives a notice of redemption of PCS for cash and (ii) the Company has paid to the Property
Trustee a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, then
on the redemption date, the Property Trustee will irrevocably deposit with DTC funds sufficient to pay the
redemption price for the PCS being redeemed. The Trust will also give DTC irrevocable instructions and authority
to pay the redemption amount in immediately available funds to the beneficial owners of the global securities
representing the PCS. Distributions to be paid on or before the redemption date for any PCS called for redemption
will be payable to the holders on the record date for the related Distribution Date. If the PCS called for redemption
are no longer in book-entry form, the Property Trustee, to the extent funds are available, will irrevocably deposit
with the paying agent for the PCS funds sufficient to pay the applicable redemption price and will give such paying
agent irrevocable instructions and authority to pay the redemption price to the holders thereof upon surrender of
their certificates evidencing the PCS.
If notice of redemption shall have been given and funds deposited as required, then upon the date of such
deposit:
• all rights of the holders of such PCS called for redemption will cease, except the right of the holders of
such PCS to receive the redemption price and any distribution payable in respect of the PCS on or prior
to the redemption date, but without interest on such redemption price; and
• the PCS called for redemption will cease to be outstanding.
If any redemption date is not a business day, then the redemption amount will be payable on the next
succeeding business day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay).
If payment of the redemption amount for any shares of Series A Preferred Stock called for redemption is
improperly withheld or refused and accordingly the redemption amount of the relevant PCS is not paid either by the
7
Trust or by the Company under the Guarantee, then dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock will continue to
accrue and distributions on such PCS called for redemption will continue to accumulate at the applicable rate then
borne by such PCS from the original redemption date scheduled to the actual date of payment. In this case, the
actual payment date will be considered the redemption date for purposes of calculating the redemption amount.
Redemptions of the PCS will require prior approval of the Federal Reserve.
If less than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed on a redemption
date, then the aggregate liquidation amount of PCS and Trust Common Securities to be redeemed shall be
allocated pro rata to the PCS and Trust Common Securities based upon the relative liquidation amounts of such
series, except as set forth under “—Ranking of Trust Common Securities” below. The Property Trustee will select
the particular PCS to be redeemed on a pro rata basis not more than 60 days before the redemption date from the
outstanding PCS not previously called for redemption or, if that is not practical, by lot or any other method the
Property Trustee deems fair and appropriate, or if the PCS are in book-entry only form, in accordance with the
procedures of DTC. The Property Trustee shall promptly notify the Transfer Agent in writing of the PCS selected
for redemption and, in the case of any PCS selected for partial redemption, the liquidation amount to be redeemed.
For all purposes of the Trust Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, all provisions relating to the
redemption of PCS shall relate, in the case of any PCS redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion of
the aggregate liquidation amount of PCS that has been or is to be redeemed. If less than all of the PCS are
redeemed, the PCS held through the facilities of DTC will be redeemed pro rata in accordance with the procedures
of DTC.
Subject to applicable law, including, without limitation, U.S. federal securities laws and subject to the
Federal Reserve’s risk-based capital rules applicable to bank holding companies, the Company or its affiliates may
at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding PCS by tender, in the open market or by private agreement.
Liquidation Distribution upon Dissolution
Pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Trust shall dissolve on the first to occur of:
• certain events of bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the holder of the Trust Common Securities;
• upon the direction of the holder of the Trust Common Securities to terminate the Trust and distribute
corresponding assets in exchange for the PCS;
• redemption of all of the PCS as described above; and
• the entry of an order for the dissolution of the Trust by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Except as set forth in the next paragraph, if an early dissolution occurs as a result of certain events of
bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of the holder of Trust Common Securities, the Property Trustee and the
administrative trustees will liquidate the Trust as expeditiously as they determine possible by distributing, after
satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each holder of PCS a like amount
of corresponding assets as of the date of such distribution. Except as set forth in the next paragraph, if an early
dissolution occurs as a result of the entry of an order for the dissolution of the Trust by a court of competent
jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by applicable law, the Property Trustee and the administrative trustees will
liquidate the Trust as expeditiously as they determine to be possible by distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to
creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, to each holder of PCS a like amount of corresponding assets as
of the date of such distribution. The Property Trustee or the administrative trustees shall give notice of liquidation to
each holder of PCS at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date of liquidation.
If, whether because of an order for dissolution entered by a court of competent jurisdiction or otherwise, the
Property Trustee determines that distribution of the corresponding assets in the manner described above is not
practical, or if the early dissolution occurs as a result of the redemption of all the PCS, the Property Trustee shall
liquidate the property of the Trust and wind up its affairs. In that case, upon the winding-up of the Trust, except with
8
respect to an early dissolution that occurs as a result of the redemption of all the PCS, the holders will be entitled to
receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to holders and, after satisfaction of liabilities to
creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, an amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount per Trust
security plus accrued and unpaid distributions to the date of payment. If, upon any such winding-up, the Trust has
insufficient assets available to pay in full such aggregate liquidation distribution, then the amounts payable directly
by the Trust on its Trust securities shall be paid on a pro rata basis based upon liquidation amounts, except as set
forth under “—Ranking of Trust Common Securities” below.
The term “like amount” as used above means, with respect to a distribution of Series A Preferred Stock to
holders of PCS in connection with a dissolution or liquidation of the Trust therefor, Series A Preferred Stock having
a Liquidation Preference equal to the liquidation amount of the PCS of the holder to whom such Series A Preferred
Stock would be distributed.
Distribution of Trust Assets
Upon liquidation of the Trust other than as a result of an early dissolution upon the redemption of all the
PCS and after satisfaction of the liabilities of creditors of the Trust as provided by applicable law, holders of the
Trust will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust an amount equal to the liquidation amount per Trust
security plus accumulated and unpaid distributions thereon to the date of payment.
After the liquidation date fixed for any distribution of assets of the Trust:
• the PCS will no longer be deemed to be outstanding;
• if the assets to be distributed are shares of Series A Preferred Stock, DTC or its nominee, as the record
holder of the PCS, will receive a registered global certificate or certificates representing the Series A
Preferred Stock to be delivered upon such distribution;
• any certificates representing the PCS not held by DTC or its nominee or surrendered to the exchange
agent will be deemed to represent shares of Series A Preferred Stock having a Liquidation Preference
equal to the PCS until such certificates are so surrendered for transfer and reissuance; and
• all rights of the holders of the PCS will cease, except the right to receive Series A Preferred Stock upon
such surrender.
Since each PCS corresponds to 1/100th of a share of Series A Preferred Stock, holders of PCS may receive
fractional shares of Series A Preferred Stock or depositary shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock upon
this distribution.
Ranking of Trust Common Securities
If on any Distribution Date the Trust does not have funds available from payments of dividends on the
Series A Preferred Stock to make full distributions on the PCS and the Trust Common Securities, then if the
deficiency in funds results from the Company’s failure to pay a full dividend on shares of Series A Preferred Stock
on a Dividend Payment Date, then the available funds from dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
applied first to make distributions then due on the PCS on a pro rata basis on such Distribution Date up to the
amount of such distributions corresponding to dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock (or if less, the amount of
the corresponding distributions that would have been made on the PCS had the Company paid a full dividend on the
Series A Preferred Stock) before any such amount is applied to make a distribution on Trust Common Securities on
such Distribution Date.
If on any date where PCS and Trust Common Securities must be redeemed because the Company is
redeeming Series A Preferred Stock and the Trust does not have funds available from the Company’s redemption of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock to pay the full redemption price then due on all of the outstanding PCS and Trust
Common Securities to be redeemed, then (i) the available funds shall be applied first to pay the redemption price on
the PCS to be redeemed on such redemption date and (ii) Trust Common Securities shall be redeemed only to the
9
extent funds are available for such purpose after the payment of the full redemption price on the PCS to be
redeemed.
If an early dissolution event occurs in respect of the Trust, no liquidation distributions shall be made on the
Trust Common Securities until full liquidation distributions have been made on the PCS.
In the case of any event of default under the Trust Agreement resulting from the Company’s failure to
comply in any material respect with any of its obligations as issuer of the Series A Preferred Stock, including
obligations set forth in its Restated Certificate of Incorporation or arising under applicable law, the Company, as
holder of the Trust Common Securities, will be deemed to have waived any right to act with respect to any such
event of default under the Trust Agreement until the effect of all such events of default with respect to the PCS have
been cured, waived or otherwise eliminated. Until all events of default under the Trust Agreement have been so
cured, waived or otherwise eliminated, the Property Trustee shall act solely on behalf of the holders of the PCS and
not on the Company’s behalf, and only the holders of the PCS will have the right to direct the Property Trustee to
act on their behalf.
Events of Default; Notice
Any one of the following events constitutes an event of default under the Trust Agreement, or a “Trust
Event of Default,” regardless of the reason for such event of default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary
or be effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or
regulation of any administrative or governmental body:
• the failure of the Company to comply in any material respect with any of its obligations as issuer of the
Series A Preferred Stock, under the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, or arising under
applicable law;
• the default by the Trust in the payment of any distribution on any Trust security of the Trust when such
becomes due and payable, and continuation of such default for a period of 30 days;
• the default by the Trust in the payment of any redemption price of any Trust security of the Trust when
such becomes due and payable;
• the failure to perform or the breach, in any material respect, of any other covenant or warranty of the
trustees in the Trust Agreement for 90 days after the trustees and the Company have been given notice
specifying such default or breach from holders of at least 25% in aggregate liquidation amount of the
outstanding PCS and requiring it to be remedied; or
• the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to the Property Trustee and
the Company’s failure to appoint a successor Property Trustee within 60 days thereof.
Within 30 days after any Trust Event of Default actually known to the Property Trustee or the
administrative trustees occurs, the Property Trustee or the administrative trustees will transmit notice of such Trust
Event of Default to the holders of each affected series of Trust securities, unless such Trust Event of Default shall
have been cured or waived. The Company, as depositor, and the administrative trustees are required to file annually
with the Property Trustee a certificate as to whether or not the Company or they are in compliance with all the
conditions and covenants applicable to the Company and to them under the Trust Agreement.
Mergers, Consolidations, Amalgamations or Replacements of the Trust
The Trust may not merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or
lease its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to the Company or any other person, except as described
below or as otherwise described in the Trust Agreement. The Trust may, at the Company’s request, with the consent
of the administrative trustees but without the consent of the holders of the PCS, the Property Trustee or the
Delaware Trustee, merge with or into, consolidate, amalgamate, or be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its
properties and assets substantially as an entirety to, the Trust organized as such under the laws of any state if:
10
• such successor entity either:
o expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Trust with respect to the PCS, or
o substitutes for the PCS other securities having substantially the same terms as the PCS, or the
“Successor Securities,” so long as the Successor Securities rank the same as the PCS in priority
with respect to distributions and payments upon liquidation, redemption and otherwise;
• the Successor Securities of any series are listed or will be listed upon notification of issuance, on any
national securities exchange or other organization on which the PCS are listed;
• a trustee of such successor entity possessing the same powers and duties as the Property Trustee is
appointed to hold the Series A Preferred Stock then held by or on behalf of the Property Trustee;
• such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not cause
the PCS, including any Successor Securities, to be downgraded by any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization;
• such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not
adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the PCS, including any
Successor Securities, in any material respect;
• such successor entity has purposes substantially identical to those of the Trust;
• prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease, the
Property Trustee has received an opinion from counsel to the Trust experienced in such matters to the
effect that:
o such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease does not
adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the holders of the PCS, including any
Successor Securities, in any material respect, and
o following such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, replacement, conveyance, transfer or lease,
neither the Trust nor such successor entity will be required to register as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”);
• the Property Trustee, the Delaware Trustee and the administrative trustees have received an opinion of
counsel experienced in such matters that such merger, consolidation, amalgamation, conveyance,
transfer or lease will not cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as an association or a
publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and
• the Company or any permitted transferee owns all of the common securities of such successor entity
and guarantees the obligations of such successor entity under the Successor Securities at least to the
extent provided by the Guarantee.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trust may, with the consent of holders of 100% in liquidation amount of
the PCS, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by or convey, transfer or lease its properties
and assets substantially as an entirety to any other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate,
merge with or into, or replace it even if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger, replacement, conveyance,
transfer or lease would cause the Trust or the successor entity to be classified as other than one or more grantor
trusts or agency arrangements or to be classified as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Voting Rights; Amendment of the Trust Agreement
Except as provided herein and under “Description of the Guarantee—Amendments and Assignment” below
and as otherwise required by law and the Trust Agreement, the holders of the PCS will have no voting rights or
control over the administration, operation or management of the Trust or the obligations of the parties to the Trust
11
Agreement, including in respect of Series A Preferred Stock beneficially owned by the Trust. Under the Trust
Agreement, however, the Property Trustee will be required to obtain their consent before exercising some of its
rights in respect of these securities.
Trust Agreement. The Company and the administrative trustees may amend the Trust Agreement without
the consent of the holders of the PCS, the Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, unless in the case of the first
two bullets below such amendment will adversely affect in a material respect the interests of any holder of PCS, the
Property Trustee or the Delaware Trustee, to:
• cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provisions in the Trust Agreement that may be
inconsistent with any other provision, or to make any other provisions with respect to matters or
questions arising under such Trust Agreement, which may not be inconsistent with the other provisions
of the Trust Agreement;
• modify, eliminate or add to any provisions of the Trust Agreement to such extent as shall be necessary
to ensure that the Trust will not be taxable as a corporation or classified as a partnership for U.S. federal
income tax purposes at all times that any Trust securities are outstanding, to ensure that the Trust will
not be required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act or to ensure
the treatment of the PCS as Tier 1 capital under prevailing Federal Reserve rules and regulations;
• provide that certificates for the PCS may be executed by an administrative trustee by facsimile signature
instead of manual signature, in which case such amendment(s) shall also provide for the appointment by
the Company of an authentication agent and certain related provisions;
• require that holders that are not U.S. persons for U.S. federal income tax purposes irrevocably appoint a
U.S. person to exercise any voting rights to ensure that the Trust will not be treated as a foreign trust for
U.S. federal income tax purposes; or
• conform the terms of the Trust Agreement to the description of the Trust Agreement, the PCS and the
Trust Common Securities in the prospectus supplement relating to the PCS, in the manner provided in
the Trust Agreement.
Any such amendment shall become effective when notice thereof is given to the Property Trustee, the
Delaware Trustee and the holders of the PCS.
The Company and the administrative trustees may generally amend the Trust Agreement with:
• the consent of holders representing not less than a majority, based upon liquidation amounts, of the PCS
affected by the amendments; and
• receipt by the administrative trustees of the Trust of an opinion of counsel to the effect that such
amendment or the exercise of any power granted to the trustees of the Trust or administrative trustees in
accordance with such amendment will not affect the Trust’s status as one or more grantor trusts or
agency arrangements for U.S. federal income tax purposes, cause the Trust to be classified as an
association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes
or affect the Trust’s exemption from status as an “investment company” under the Investment Company
Act.
However, without the consent of each affected holder of Trust securities, the Trust Agreement may not be
amended to:
• change the amount or timing, or otherwise adversely affect the amount, of any distribution required to
be made in respect of Trust securities as of a specified date; or
• restrict the right of a holder of Trust securities to institute a suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or after such date.
12
Prior to the issuance of definitive certificates representing the PCS upon any termination of the global
securities, without the consent of the holders of the PCS, the Company and the trustees of the Trust will enter into
such amendments or supplements to the Trust Agreement as are necessary to provide for exchanges of PCS in
definitive form and vice versa.
Series A Preferred Stock. So long as the Series A Preferred Stock is held by the Property Trustee on
behalf of the Trust, the trustees of the Trust will not waive any rights in respect of the Series A Preferred Stock
without obtaining the prior approval of the holders of at least a majority in liquidation amount of the PCS then
outstanding. The trustees of the Trust shall also not consent to any amendment to the Trust’s or the Company’s
governing documents that would change the dates on which dividends are payable or the amount of such dividends,
without the prior written consent of each holder of PCS. In addition to obtaining the foregoing approvals from
holders, the Property Trustee shall obtain, at the Company’s expense, an opinion of counsel to the effect that such
action shall not cause the Trust to be taxable as a corporation or classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes.
General. Any required approval of holders of the PCS may be given at a meeting of holders of the PCS
convened for such purpose or pursuant to written consent. The Property Trustee will cause a notice of any meeting
at which holders the PCS are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action by written consent of such holders
is to be taken, to be given to each record holder of such PCS in the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement.
No vote or consent of the holders of PCS will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel the PCS in
accordance with the Trust Agreement.
Notwithstanding that holders of the PCS are entitled to vote or consent under any of the circumstances
described above, any of the PCS that are owned by the Company or its affiliates or the trustees or any of their
affiliates shall, for purposes of such vote or consent, be treated as if they were not outstanding.
Voting and consensual rights available to or in favor of holders or beneficial owners under the Trust
Agreement may be exercised only by a United States Person that is a beneficial owner of a Trust security or by a
United States Person acting as irrevocable agent with discretionary powers for the beneficial owner of a Trust
security that is not a United States Person. Holders that are not United States Persons must irrevocably appoint a
United States Person with discretionary powers to act as their agent with respect to such voting and consensual
rights. For this purpose, “United States Person” means a citizen or resident of the United States, a domestic
partnership, a domestic corporation, an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation
regardless of its source, and a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over
the administration of the trust, and (ii) one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial
decisions of the trust.
Listing
The PCS are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BK/P.”
Payment and Paying Agent
Payments on the PCS shall be made to DTC, which shall credit the relevant accounts on the applicable
Distribution Dates. If any PCS are not held by DTC, such payments shall be made by check mailed to the address of
the holder as such address shall appear on the register.
The paying agent is The Bank of New York Mellon.
Registrar and Transfer Agent
The Bank of New York Mellon is the registrar and transfer agent, or the “Transfer Agent,” for the PCS.
13
Information Concerning the Property Trustee
Other than during the occurrence and continuance of a Trust Event of Default, the Property Trustee
undertakes to perform only the duties that are specifically set forth in the Trust Agreement. After a Trust Event of
Default, the Property Trustee must exercise the same degree of care and skill as a prudent person would exercise or
use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs, subject to the protections and limitations on
liability afforded to the Property Trustee under the Trust Agreement and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”). Subject to this provision, the Property Trustee is under no obligation to
exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Trust Agreement at the request of any holder of PCS unless it is
offered indemnity satisfactory to it by such holder against the costs, expenses and liabilities that might be incurred.
If no Trust Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Property Trustee is required to decide between
alternative courses of action, construe ambiguous or inconsistent provisions in the Trust Agreement or is unsure of
the application of any provision of the Trust Agreement, and the matter is not one upon which holders of PCS are
entitled under the Trust Agreement to vote, then the Property Trustee will take any action that the Company directs.
If the Company does not provide direction, the Property Trustee may take any action that it deems advisable and in
the interests of the holders of the Trust securities and will have no liability except for its own bad faith, negligence
or willful misconduct.
The Company and its affiliates may maintain certain accounts and other banking relationships with the
Property Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.
Governing Law
The Trust Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
Miscellaneous
The administrative trustees are authorized and directed to conduct the affairs of and to operate the Trust in
such a way that it will not be required to register as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act
or characterized as other than one or more grantor trusts or agency arrangements for U.S. federal income tax
purposes.
In this regard, the Company and the administrative trustees are authorized to take any action, not
inconsistent with applicable law, the certificate of trust of the Trust or the Trust Agreement, that the Company and
the administrative trustees determine to be necessary or desirable to achieve such end, as long as such action does
not materially and adversely affect the interests of the holders of the PCS.
Holders of the PCS have no preemptive or similar rights. The PCS are not convertible into or exchangeable
for the Company’s common stock or Series A Preferred Stock.
Description of the Guarantee
General
The following payments or distributions on the PCS, also referred to as the “guarantee payments,” if not
fully paid or made by or on behalf of the Trust, will be paid by the Company under a guarantee (the “Guarantee”)
for the benefit of the holders of PCS. Pursuant to the Guarantee, the Company will irrevocably and unconditionally
agree to pay in full the guarantee payments, without duplication:
• any accumulated and unpaid distributions required to be paid on each series of PCS, to the extent the
Trust has funds available to make the payment;
• the redemption price with respect to any PCS called for redemption by the Trust; and
• upon a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, winding-up or liquidation of the Trust, other than in
connection with a distribution of a like amount of corresponding assets to the holders of the PCS, the
lesser of:
14
o the aggregate of the liquidation amount and all accumulated and unpaid distributions on the PCS to
the date of payment, to the extent the Trust has funds available to make the payment; and
o the amount of assets of the Trust remaining available for distribution to holders of the PCS upon
liquidation of the Trust.
The Company’s obligation to make a guarantee payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required
amounts by the Company to the holders of the PCS or by causing the Trust to pay the amounts to the holders.
If the Company does not make a regular dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock, the Trust will
not have sufficient funds to make the related payments on the PCS. The Guarantee does not cover payments on the
PCS when the Trust does not have sufficient funds to make these payments. Because the Company is a holding
company, the Company’s rights to participate in the assets of any of its subsidiaries upon the subsidiary’s
liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors except to the extent that
the Company may itself be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary. The Guarantee does not limit
the incurrence or issuance by the Company of secured or unsecured indebtedness.
The Guarantee is issued pursuant to a Guarantee Agreement (the “Guarantee Agreement”) that the
Company entered into with Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company (“M&T”). The Guarantee Agreement is
qualified as an indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. M&T will act as “Guarantee Trustee” under the Guarantee
Agreement for purposes of compliance with the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act. The Guarantee Trustee will
hold the Guarantee for the benefit of the holders of the PCS.
Effect of the Guarantee
The Guarantee and the Trust’s obligations under the Trust Agreement, including the obligations to
pay costs, expenses, debts and liabilities of the Trust, other than with respect to the Trust securities, has the effect of
providing a full and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, of payments due on the PCS. The Company
also agreed separately to irrevocably and unconditionally guarantee the obligations of the Trust with respect to the
Trust Common Securities to the same extent as the Guarantee.
Status of the Guarantee
The Guarantee is unsecured and ranks pari passu with other guarantees for payments on securities issued by
the Company’s trusts in the future to the extent the preferred stock held by such trusts ranks pari passu with the
Series A Preferred Stock and the Company’s preferred stock that it issues in the future to the extent that by its terms
it ranks pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock.
The Guarantee constitutes a guarantee of payment and not of collection, which means that the guaranteed
party may sue the guarantor to enforce its rights under the Guarantee without suing any other person or entity. The
Guarantee will be held for the benefit of the holders of the PCS. The Guarantee will be discharged only by payment
of the guarantee payments in full to the extent not paid by the Trust.
Amendments and Assignment
The Guarantee may be amended only with the prior approval of the holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate liquidation amount of the outstanding PCS. No vote will be required, however, for any changes that do
not adversely affect the rights of holders of the PCS in any material respect. All guarantees and agreements
contained in the Guarantee will bind the Company’s successors, assignees, receivers, trustees and representatives
and will be for the benefit of the holders of the PCS then outstanding.
Termination of the Guarantee
The Guarantee will terminate:
• upon full payment of the redemption price of all PCS; or
15
• upon full payment of the amounts payable in accordance with the Trust Agreement upon liquidation of
the Trust.
The Guarantee will continue to be effective or will be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any
holder of PCS must restore payment of any sums paid under the PCS or the Guarantee.
Events of Default
An event of default under the Guarantee will occur if the Company fails to perform any payment obligation
or if the Company fails to perform any other obligation under the Guarantee and, except with respect to a default in
payment of a guarantee payment, receives a notice of a default and such default remains uncured for 30 days.
The holders of a majority in liquidation amount of the PCS have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Guarantee Trustee in respect of the Guarantee
or to direct the exercise of any trust or power conferred upon the Guarantee Trustee under the Guarantee
Agreement. Any holder of PCS may institute a legal proceeding directly against the Company to enforce such
holder’s rights, without first instituting a legal proceeding against the Trust, the Guarantee Trustee or any other
person or entity.
As guarantor, the Company is required to file annually with the Guarantee Trustee a certificate as to
whether or not the Company is in compliance with all applicable conditions and covenants under the Guarantee.
Information Concerning the Guarantee Trustee
Prior to the occurrence of an event of default relating to the Guarantee, the Guarantee Trustee is required to
perform only the duties that are specifically set forth in the Guarantee. Following the occurrence of an event of
default, the Guarantee Trustee will exercise the same degree of care as a prudent person would exercise in the
conduct of his or her own affairs. Provided that the foregoing requirements have been met, the Guarantee Trustee is
under no obligation to exercise any of the powers vested in it by the Guarantee at the request of any holder of PCS,
unless offered adequate security and indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
might be incurred thereby.
The Company and its affiliates may maintain certain accounts and other banking relationships with the
Guarantee Trustee and its affiliates in the ordinary course of business.
Governing Law
The Guarantee is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
Description of the Series A Preferred Stock
General
Under the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the Company has authority to issue up to
100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. The Company has 5,001 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock outstanding. The Series A Preferred Stock is validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
The Company’s Certificate of Designations of Series A Preferred Stock (the “Series A Certificate of
Designations”) was filed on June 15, 2007 with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, and is incorporated
by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Series A Preferred Stock has a fixed liquidation
preference of $100,000 per share. The Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock or any other
class or series of the Company’s securities and is not subject to any sinking fund or any other obligation of the
Company for their repurchase or retirement. The Series A Preferred Stock represents non-withdrawable capital, is
not an account of an insurable type, and is not insured or guaranteed by FDIC or any other governmental agency or
instrumentality.
16
The Company issued the Series A Preferred Stock to the Trust. Unless the Trust is dissolved, prior to the
redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of PCS will not receive shares of Series A Preferred Stock, and
their interest in the Series A Preferred Stock will be represented by their PCS. If the Trust is dissolved, the
Company may elect to distribute depositary shares representing the Series A Preferred Stock instead of fractional
shares. Since the Series A Preferred Stock is held by the Property Trustee, holders of PCS may be able to exercise
voting or other rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock only through the Property Trustee.
Ranking
With respect to the payment of dividends and the distributions of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up, the Series A Preferred Stock ranks:
• senior to the Company’s Common Stock and all other equity securities issued by the Company, the
terms of which specifically provide that such equity securities will rank junior to the Series A Preferred
Stock (for purposes of the description of the Series A Preferred Stock, the “junior stock”);
• on a parity with the Company’s Series F Preferred Stock, Series G Preferred Stock, Series H Preferred
Stock and Series I Preferred Stock;
• senior to or on a parity with each other series of preferred stock the Company may issue (except for any
senior series that may be issued upon the requisite vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of
the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding and entitled to vote and the requisite
vote or consent of all other series of preferred stock) with respect to the payment of dividends and
distributions of assets upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company; and
• junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other non-equity claims on the Company.
During any Dividend Period, so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain outstanding, unless
(a) the full dividends for the then-current Dividend Period on all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock have been
declared and paid, or declared and funds set aside therefor, and (b) the Company is not in default on its obligation to
redeem any shares of Series A Preferred Stock that have been called for redemption, no dividend whatsoever shall
be paid or declared on the Company’s common stock or other junior stock, other than a dividend payable solely in
junior stock. The Company and its subsidiaries also may not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for
consideration any shares of common stock or other junior stock (other than as a result of reclassification of junior
stock for or into junior stock, or the exchange or conversion of one share of junior stock for or into another share of
junior stock, and other than through the use of the proceeds of a substantially contemporaneous sale of other shares
of junior stock), nor will the Company pay to or make available any monies for a sinking fund for the redemption
of, any of its common stock or other junior stock during a Dividend Period, unless it has paid full dividends on the
Series A Preferred Stock for the most recently-completed Dividend Period (or set aside a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof). However, the foregoing provisions shall not restrict the ability of the Company or any of its
affiliates to engage in any market-making transactions in the Company’s junior stock in the ordinary course of
business.
On any Dividend Payment Date for which full dividends are not paid, or declared and funds set aside
therefor, upon the Series A Preferred Stock, the Series F Preferred Stock, the Series G Preferred Stock, the Series H
Preferred Stock, the Series I Preferred Stock and other equity securities designated as ranking on a parity with the
Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends (“Dividend Parity Stock”), all dividends paid or declared for
payment on that Dividend Payment Date with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock and the Dividend Parity Stock
shall be shared:
• first ratably by the holders of any such shares who have the right to receive dividends with respect to
Dividend Periods prior to the then-current Dividend Period for which such dividends were not declared
and paid, in proportion to the respective amounts of the undeclared and unpaid dividends relating to
prior Dividend Periods; and
• thereafter by the holders of these shares on a pro rata basis.
17
The Company has agreed, in the Series A Certificate of Designations, not to issue preferred stock having
dividend payment dates that are not also Dividend Payment Dates for the Series A Preferred Stock.
Subject to the foregoing, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be determined by the
board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board of directors) may be declared and paid on the
Company’s common stock and any other stock ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock from time to time out
of any funds legally available for such payment, and the Series A Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate
in any such dividend.
Dividends
Dividends on shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not be mandatory. Holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock, in preference to the holders of the Company’s common stock and of any other shares of the Company’s stock
ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends, will be entitled to receive, only when, as
and if declared by the board of directors or a duly authorized committee of the board of directors, out of funds
legally available for payment, non-cumulative cash dividends. These dividends will be payable at a rate per
annum that will be reset quarterly and will equal the greater of (i) from and including September 2023, three-month
CME Term SOFR (plus a spread adjustment of 0.26161%) plus 0.565% and (ii) 4.000% (the “Dividend Rate”),
each applied to the $100,000 liquidation preference per share and will be paid on March 20, June 20, September 20
and December 20 of each year (each, a “Dividend Payment Date”), with respect to the Dividend Period, or portion
thereof, ending on the day preceding the respective Dividend Payment Date. A “Dividend Period” means each
period commencing on (and including) a Dividend Payment Date and continuing to (but not including) the next
succeeding Dividend Payment Date. Dividends will be paid to holders of record on the respective date fixed for that
purpose by the board of directors or a committee thereof in advance of payment of each particular dividend. The
Dividend Rate will be reset quarterly. If any day that would otherwise be a Dividend Payment Date is not a business
day, then the next business day will be the applicable Dividend Payment Date.
The amount of dividends payable per share of Series A Preferred Stock on each Dividend Payment Date
will be calculated by multiplying the per annum Dividend Rate in effect for that Dividend Period by a fraction, the
numerator of which will be the actual number of days in that Dividend Period and the denominator of which will be
360, and multiplying the rate obtained by $100,000.
“CME Term SOFR” means the CME Term SOFR Reference Rates published for one-, three-, six-, and 12-
month tenors as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration, Ltd. (or any successor administrator
thereof).
“Dividend Determination Date” means the second London Banking Day immediately preceding the first
day of the relevant Dividend Period.
“London Banking Day” means any day on which commercial banks are open for general business
(including dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars) in London.
If the Company determines not to pay any dividend or a full dividend, it will provide prior written notice to
the Property Trustee, who will notify holders of PCS and the administrative trustees.
The Company’s ability to pay dividends on its Series A Preferred Stock is subject to policies established by
the Federal Reserve. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
—Supervision and Regulation—Capital Planning and Stress Testing—Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases
and Other Capital Distributions” and Part I, “Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.
Redemption
The Series A Preferred Stock may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company’s option. Any such
redemption will be at a cash redemption price of $100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends,
18
without regard to any undeclared dividends. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have no right to require the
redemption or repurchase of the Series A Preferred Stock.
If fewer than all of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are to be redeemed, the shares to be
redeemed will be selected either pro rata from the holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred Stock in
proportion to the number of shares held by those holders or by lot or in such other manner as the board of directors
or a committee thereof may determine to be fair and equitable.
The Company will mail notice of every redemption of Series A Preferred Stock by first class mail, postage
prepaid, addressed to the holders of record of the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their respective last
addresses appearing on its books. This mailing will be at least 30 days and not more than 60 days before the date
fixed for redemption (provided that if the Series A Preferred Stock is held in book-entry form through DTC, the
Company may give this notice in any manner permitted by DTC). Any notice mailed or otherwise given as
described in this paragraph will be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder
receives this notice, and failure duly to give this notice by mail or otherwise, or any defect in this notice or in the
mailing or provision of this notice, to any holder of Series A Preferred Stock designated for redemption will not
affect the redemption of any other Series A Preferred Stock. If the Company redeems the Series A Preferred Stock,
the Trust, as holder of the Series A Preferred Stock, will redeem the corresponding PCS as described above under
“Description of the PCS—Mandatory Redemption of PCS upon Redemption of Series A Preferred Stock.”
Each notice shall state:
• the redemption date;
• the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed and, if less than all shares of Series A
Preferred Stock held by the holder are to be redeemed, the number of shares to be redeemed from the
holder;
• the redemption price; and
• the place or places where certificates for the Series A Preferred Stock are to be surrendered for payment
of the redemption price.
If notice of redemption of any Series A Preferred Stock has been given and if the funds necessary for the
redemption have been set aside by the Company for the benefit of the holders of any shares of Series A Preferred
Stock so called for redemption, then, on and after the redemption date, those shares shall no longer be deemed
outstanding and all rights of the holders of those shares (including the right to receive any dividends) will terminate,
except the right to receive the redemption price.
The Company’s right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock once issued is subject to the prior approval of
the Federal Reserve. Under the capital adequacy rules currently applicable to the Company, prior to exercising the
Company’s right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company must either (i) demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Federal Reserve that, following redemption, the Company will continue to hold capital
commensurate with the Company’s risk; or (ii) replace the Series A Preferred Stock redeemed or to be redeemed
with an equal amount of instruments that will qualify as Tier 1 capital under regulations of the Federal Reserve
immediately following or concurrent with redemption.
Liquidation Rights
In the event that the Company voluntarily or involuntarily liquidates, dissolves or winds up its affairs,
holders of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive an amount per share (the “Total Liquidation
Amount”) equal to the fixed liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, plus any declared and unpaid dividends
prior to the date of payment of such distribution (but without any amount in respect of dividends that have not been
declared prior to such payment date). Holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive the Total
Liquidation Amount out of the Company’s assets or proceeds thereof (whether capital or surplus) that are available
for distribution to stockholders, after payment or provision for payment of its debts and other liabilities but before
19
any distribution of assets or proceeds is made to holders of the Company’s common stock or any other shares
ranking, as to that distribution, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock.
If the Company’s assets or proceeds thereof are not sufficient to pay the Total Liquidation Amount in full to
all holders of Series A Preferred Stock and all holders of any shares of its stock ranking as to any such distribution
on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, the amounts paid to the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and to
such other shares will be paid pro rata in accordance with the respective Total Liquidation Amount for those
holders. If the Total Liquidation Amount per Series A Preferred Stock has been paid in full to all holders of Series A
Preferred Stock and the liquidation preference of any other shares ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred
Stock has been paid in full, the holders of the Company’s common stock or any other shares ranking, as to such
distribution, junior to the Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive all of the Company’s remaining assets
according to their respective rights and preferences.
For purposes of the liquidation rights, neither the sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer of all or
substantially all of the Company’s property and assets, nor the consolidation or merger by the Company with or into
any other corporation or by another corporation with or into the Company, will constitute a liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of the Company’s affairs.
Voting Rights
Except as indicated below or otherwise required by law, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will not
have any voting rights.
Right to Elect Two Directors upon Non-Payment of Dividends. If and when the dividends on the Series
A Preferred Stock and any other class or series of the Company’s stock, whether bearing dividends on a noncumulative or cumulative basis but otherwise ranking on a parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to payment of
dividends and that has voting rights equivalent to those described in this paragraph (“Voting Parity Stock”), have
not been declared and paid in an aggregate amount (i) in the case of the Series A Preferred Stock and Voting Parity
Stock bearing non-cumulative dividends, equal to at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether
or not consecutive), or (ii) in the case of Voting Parity Stock bearing cumulative dividends, in an aggregate amount
equal to full dividends for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive) (a
“Nonpayment Event”), the authorized number of directors then constituting the board of directors will automatically
be increased by two. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock, together with the holders of Voting Parity Stock, voting
as a single class, will be entitled to elect the two additional members of the board of directors (the “Series A
Preferred Stock Directors”) at any annual or special meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected or
any special meeting of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and any voting parity stock for which dividends have
not been paid, called as described below, but only if the election of any Series A Preferred Stock Directors would
not cause the Company to violate the corporate governance requirement of the New York Stock Exchange (or any
other exchange on which the Company’s securities may be listed) that listed companies must have a majority of
independent directors. In addition, the board of directors shall at no time have more than two Series A Preferred
Stock Directors.
At any time after this voting power has vested as described above, the Company’s Secretary may, and upon
the written request of holders of record of at least 20% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and
Voting Parity Stock (addressed to the Secretary at the Company’s principal office) must, call a special meeting of
the holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Voting Parity Stock for the election of the Series A Preferred Stock
Directors. Notice for a special meeting will be given in a similar manner to that provided in the Company’s
Amended and Restated By-laws for a special meeting of the shareholders, which the Company will provide upon
request, or as required by law. If the Secretary is required to call a meeting but does not do so within 20 days after
receipt of any such request, then any holder of shares of Series A Preferred Stock may (at the Company’s expense)
call such meeting, upon notice as described in this section, and for that purpose will have access to the Company’s
stock books. The Series A Preferred Stock Directors elected at any such special meeting will hold office until the
next annual meeting of shareholders unless they have been previously terminated as described below. In case any
vacancy occurs among the Series A Preferred Stock Directors, a successor will be elected by the board of directors
to serve until the next annual meeting of the shareholders upon the nomination of the then remaining Series A
20
Preferred Stock Director or, if none remains in office, by the vote of the holders of record of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a single class. The Series A Preferred Stock Directors shall
each be entitled to one vote per director on any matter.
Whenever full dividends have been paid on the Series A Preferred Stock and any non-cumulative Voting
Parity Stock for at least one year after a Nonpayment Event and all dividends on any cumulative Voting Parity
Stock have been paid in full, then the right of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to elect the Series A Preferred
Stock Directors will have ceased (but subject always to the same provisions for the vesting of these voting rights in
the case of any similar non-payment of dividends in respect of future Dividend Periods), the terms of office of all
Series A Preferred Stock Directors will immediately terminate and the number of directors constituting the board of
directors will be reduced accordingly.
Other Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, in addition to any
other vote or consent of shareholders required by law or by the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the
vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the time outstanding,
voting separately as a single class, given in person or by proxy, either in writing without a meeting or by vote at any
meeting called for the purpose, shall be necessary for effecting or validating:
• Amendment of Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of any
provision of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws
of the Company so as to adversely affect the special rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of
the Series A Preferred Stock. However, any amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize
or create, or to increase the authorized amount of, any junior stock or any class or series or any
securities convertible into shares of any class or series of Dividend Parity Stock or other series of
preferred stock ranking equally with the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to the distribution of
assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company will not be deemed to adversely
affect the rights, preferences, privileges or voting powers of the Series A Preferred Stock; or
• Certain Mergers and Consolidations. Any consummation of a binding share exchange or
reclassification involving the Series A Preferred Stock, or of a merger or consolidation of the Company
with or into another corporation or other entity, or any merger or consolidation of the Company with or
into any entity other than a corporation unless in each case (i) the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock
remain outstanding or, in the case of any such merger or consolidation with respect to which the
Company is not the surviving or resulting corporation, are converted into or exchanged for preference
securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or a corporation controlling such corporation and
(ii) such shares remaining outstanding or such preference securities have such rights, preferences,
privileges and voting powers, and limitations and restrictions thereof that, if such change were effected
by amendment of the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, would not require a vote of the
holders of the Series A Preferred Stock under the preceding paragraph.
Each holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote per each $100,000 liquidation
preference to which his or her shares are entitled on any matter on which holders of Series A Preferred Stock are
entitled to vote, including any action by written consent.
The foregoing voting provisions will not apply if, at or prior to the time when the act with respect to which
the vote would otherwise be required shall be effected, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall have
been redeemed or called for redemption upon proper notice and sufficient funds shall have been set aside by the
Company for the benefit of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock to effect the redemption.
Form
The Series A Preferred Stock will be issued only in fully registered form. No fractional shares will be issued
unless the Trust is dissolved and the Company delivers the shares, rather than depositary receipts representing the
shares, to the registered holders of the PCS. If the Trust is dissolved and depositary receipts or shares of Series A
Preferred Stock are distributed to holders of PCS, the Company would intend to distribute them in book-entry form
21
only and the procedures governing holding and transferring beneficial interests in the Series A Preferred Stock, and
the circumstance in which holders of beneficial interests will be entitled to receive certificates evidencing their
shares or depositary receipts, will be as described under “Book-Entry System” in the prospectus relating to the
Series A Preferred Stock. If the Company determines to issue depositary shares representing fractional interests in
the Series A Preferred Stock, each depositary share will be represented by a depositary receipt. In such an event, the
Series A Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement among
the Company, a depositary and the holders from time to time of the depositary receipts representing depositary
shares. Subject to the terms and conditions of any deposit agreement, each holder of a depositary share will be
entitled, through the depositary, in proportion to the applicable fraction of a share of the Series A Preferred Stock
represented by such depositary share, to all the rights and preferences of the Series A Preferred Stock represented
thereby (including dividends, voting, redemption and liquidation rights).
Title
The Company, the transfer agent and registrar for the Series A Preferred Stock, and any of their agents may
treat the registered owner of the Series A Preferred Stock, which shall be the Property Trustee unless and until the
Trust is dissolved, as the absolute owner of that stock, whether or not any payment for the Series A Preferred Stock
shall be overdue and despite any notice to the contrary, for any purpose.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
If the Trust is dissolved and shares of Series A Preferred Stock or depositary receipts representing the Series
A Preferred Stock are distributed to holders of PCS, the Company may appoint a transfer agent, registrar and
dividend disbursement agent for the Series A Preferred Stock. The registrar for the Series A Preferred Stock will
send notices to shareholders of any meetings at which holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to vote on
any matter.

subject to Lessor’s prior approval. Lessor will use reasonable efforts to accommodate Lessee’s
needs and avoid conflicts in scheduling; provided however, that Lessor shall not be liable to
Lessee or any other person for loss, injury, or damage occasioned by any delay or failure to
furnish the Aircraft, with a flight crew, pursuant to this Agreement for any reason. Lessor shall
not be obligated to retain or contract for additional flight crew or maintenance personnel or
equipment in order to accommodate a flight request submitted by Lessee.

6.3. Subordinated Use of Aircraft. Lessee’s rights to schedule the use of the Aircraft

the extent requested by Owner or Lessor, or their respective and assigns, Lessee shall take all

assigns in the Aircraft under Applicable Law against any claims of Lessee and any persons
claiming by, through, or under Lessee.
7.2. Aircraft Maintenance. Lessor shall be solely responsible for maintenance,
preventative maintenance, and required or otherwise necessary inspections of the Aircraft, and
shall take such requirements into account in scheduling the Aircraft. No period of maintenance,
preventative maintenance, or inspection shall be delayed or postponed for the purpose of
scheduling the Aircraft, unless said maintenance or inspection can be safely conducted at a later
time in compliance with all Applicable Law, and with the sound discretion of the Pilot in
Command.
7.3. Flight Crews. Lessor shall provide to Lessee a qualified flight crew for each
flight conducted in accordance with this Agreement. Lessor may, if it so chooses, elect not to
hire its own pilots for any given flight hereunder, but to contract instead for pilot services from a
third party. Whether or not the flight crew is supplied by a third party, the flight crew is under
the exclusive command and control of Lessor in all phases of all flights conducted hereunder.
7.4. OPERATIONAL CONTROL. THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT

Operational Control of the Aircraft during any flight conducted pursuant to this Agreement,
Lessor and Lessee expressly agree that the Pilot in Command, in his or her sole discretion, may
terminate any flight, refuse to commence any flight, or take any other flight-related action which
in the judgment of the Pilot in Command is necessitated by considerations of safety. The Pilot in
Command shall have final and complete authority to postpone or cancel any flight for any reason
or condition which in his or her judgment would compromise the safety of the flight. No such
action of the Pilot in Command shall create or support any liability of Lessor to Lessee for loss,
injury, damage, or delay.
 6
7.6. Base of Operation. For purposes of this Agreement, the base of operation is
means the airport described on Schedule 2; provided, however, that the base of operation for
purposes of this Agreement may be changed temporarily or permanently by Lessor without
notice. Lessor will make reasonable efforts to notify Lessee of changes in the base of operations
at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to Lessee’s scheduled flights.
7.7. Force Majeure. Lessor shall not be liable for delay or failure to furnish the
Aircraft and flight crew pursuant to this Agreement when such failure is caused by government
regulation or authority, mechanical difficulty, war, civil commotion, strikes or labor disputes,
weather conditions, acts of God, or other unforeseen or unanticipated circumstances.
8. Insurance and Limitation of Liability. Lessor represents that the flight operations for
the Aircraft as contemplated in this Agreement will be covered by the Lessor’s aircraft all-risk
physical damage insurance (hull coverage), aircraft bodily injury and property damage liability

policies of hull insurance maintained by Lessor that may be payable as a result of any incident or
occurrence while an Aircraft is being operated on behalf of Lessee under this Agreement.
8.1. Additional policy requirements. Any policies of insurance carried in accordance
with this Agreement and any policies taken out in substitution or replacement of any such
policies shall:

maintained by Lessee; and
8.1.4. as respects hull physical damage, waive any right of set off or subrogation
against Lessee.
8.2. Limitation of Liability. Lessee agrees that the insurance specified in this Section
8 provides its sole recourse for all claims, losses, liabilities, obligations, demands, suits,
judgments or causes of action, penalties, fines, costs and expenses of any nature whatsoever,
including attorneys’ fees and expenses for or on account of or arising out of, or in any way
connected with the use of the Aircraft by Lessee or its guests, including injury to or death of any
persons, including Lessee and its guests which may result from or arise out of the use or
operation of the Aircraft during the term of this Agreement (“Claims”), regardless of whether
such Claims arise out of or are caused by, in whole or in part, the negligence, gross negligence,
or strict liability of Lessor.
8.3. In no event shall Lessor be liable to Lessee or his employees, agents,
representatives, guests, or invitees for any claims or liabilities, including property damage or
injury and death, and expenses, including attorney’s fees, in excess of the amount paid by
Lessor’s insurance carrier in the event of such loss.

evidencing the insurance required to be maintained by Lessor under this Article.
8.5. This Section shall survive termination of this Agreement.
9. Representations and Warranties. Lessee represents and warrants that Lessee shall:

only, and will not use the Aircraft for the purpose of providing transportation of passengers or
cargo for compensation or hire, for or in connection with any illegal purpose, in violation of any

FORM OF EXHIBIT A
Risk Adjustment/Forfeiture Decision Process
For any performance year in which you remain a covered employee (including as an MRT), your risk performance will be
assessed via a Risk Culture Summary Scorecard (“RCSS”) Rating and/or a Performance Management Platform (“PMP”)
Risk Goal Rating, as applicable. If, in any year, you receive an RCSS Rating or a PMP Risk Goal Rating, as applicable, of
“Partially Met Expectations” or “Did Not Meet Expectations,” your unvested awards (including any accrued dividend
equivalents) will be subject to review by the Incentive Compensation Review Committee (“ICRC”) or the Human Resources
and Compensation Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “HRCC”) for consideration of forfeiture, as
applicable. If you are no longer a covered employee (including as an MRT) or have left the Corporation, any unvested
portion of your awards (including any accrued dividend equivalents) granted while you were a covered employee (including
as an MRT) will also be subject to a risk review by the ICRC/HRCC.
In that event, as part of its review, the ICRC/HRCC will ask –
• Did your rating reflect poor risk behavior by you in a prior year?
• Did you receive an award in that year?
If the answer to both questions is yes, the ICRC/HRCC asks the following questions with respect to each of the designated
prior years:
• Financial Impact: How much did/will the issue cost the Company?
• Reputational Impact: How much of a regulatory impact did/will it have on the Company?
The ICRC/HRCC selects the impact answer that falls into the highest category below to determine the impact forfeiture
percentage.
Criteria Metric None Low Medium High

As used in this Exhibit A, the term “Company” shall mean the Corporation and its Affiliates.
Then the ICRC/HRCC asks how much, if any, control/responsibility you had regarding the situation. The answer to the last
question determines the modifier to be applied to the impact forfeiture percentage.

OF PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS – EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE US
The Performance Share Units (“PSUs”) with respect to Common Stock of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation (the “Corporation”) granted to you on the Grant Date are subject to the Notice of Award -
Performance Share Units – Executive Committee US (the “Award Notice”), these Terms and Conditions
of Performance Share Units – Executive Committee US (the “Terms and Conditions”) and all of the
terms and conditions of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
“Plan”), which is incorporated herein by reference. In the case of a conflict between the Award Notice,
these Terms and Conditions and the terms of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. A copy of
the Plan can be found on the Corporation’s equity award website (the “Award Website”),
NetBenefits.com, under “Quick Links.” Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the same
meaning as provided or reflected in the Award Notice or the Plan, as applicable. For purposes of these
Terms and Conditions, “Employer” means the Corporation or any Affiliate that employs or employed
you on the applicable date.
SECTION 1: Performance Share Unit Award
 1.1 Grant of Award. Subject to these Terms and Conditions and the terms of the Plan, the
Corporation grants you the number of PSUs as reflected in the Award Notice. The PSUs shall vest in
accordance with the Vesting Schedule and shall be subject to the Risk Adjustment Process as reflected in
the Award Notice.
 1.2 Dividend Equivalents. During the period prior to vesting, dividend equivalents shall be
determined with respect to the PSUs as if reinvested as additional PSUs on the dividend payment date and
shall be paid to you pursuant to Section 4 of these Terms and Conditions only if and to the extent that the
underlying PSUs become vested as provided in the Award Agreement, and any remaining dividend
equivalents (including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalents) shall be forfeited. In the event that
you receive any additional PSUs as an adjustment with respect to the Grant Amount, such additional
PSUs will be subject to the same restrictions as if granted under the Award Agreement as of the Grant
Date and paid pursuant to Section 4 of this Agreement.
 1.3 No Voting Rights. Prior to the settlement of your PSUs pursuant to these Terms and
Conditions, you shall not be entitled to vote the shares of Common Stock underlying the PSUs.
 1.4 Nontransferable. The PSUs shall be transferable only by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. Any other attempt to transfer the PSUs shall be null and void.
SECTION 2: Vesting, Performance Period, Forfeiture, Termination of Employment and Disability
 2.1 Vesting, Performance Period and Forfeiture.
 (a) Vesting. Subject to Sections 3 and 5.4 of these Terms and Conditions, PSUs (as may be
adjusted from the Grant Amount by reference to the performance goals and the Risk Adjustment Process)
may be earned as set forth in Attachment A for the period [Insert Performance Period] (the
“Performance Period”); provided that you remain continuously employed with your Employer through
the end of the Performance Period; and provided further that unvested PSUs (including any PSUs arising 
from dividend equivalents) are subject to forfeiture based upon the Risk Adjustment Process each year
and following completion of the Performance Period as set forth on Exhibit A. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in the Award Agreement and in accordance with Section 4.1, a vesting may be
delayed if, on the vesting date, you are the subject of ongoing disciplinary or performance management
investigations or proceedings concerning circumstances under which forfeiture or clawback of this award
could apply or such other actual or potential compensation recovery processes are ongoing under which
forfeiture or clawback of this award could apply. In such cases, the applicable portion of the award, if
any, will vest following the completion of such investigations, proceedings and/or processes to the extent
the Corporation determines that forfeiture and/or clawback does not apply.
 (b) Forfeiture upon Termination of Employment. Subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of these
Terms and Conditions, if you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer through the end of
the Performance Period, you shall cease vesting in your PSUs as of your Termination Date and any
unvested PSUs (including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalents) immediately shall terminate and
be forfeited, except in situations where vesting would have occurred but for the fact that a determination
has not yet been made as to whether a risk adjustment pursuant to Exhibit A is required, in which case
vesting shall occur in accordance with the terms of the Award Agreement provided that the Committee
determines the effect, if any, of a risk adjustment. As used herein, “Termination Date” shall mean the
last day on which you are an employee of your Employer.
(c) Forfeiture upon Termination of Employment for Cause. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in these Terms and Conditions, if your Employer terminates your employment for
Cause, your PSUs, whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including any dividend equivalent
rights (including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalents), immediately shall terminate and be
forfeited. For purposes of these Terms and Conditions, “Cause” shall mean:
(i) you have been convicted of, or have entered into a pretrial diversion or entered a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere (plea of no contest) to a crime or offense constituting a felony
(or its equivalent under applicable laws outside of the United States), or to any other crime or
offense involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, fraud, breach of trust, money laundering, or any
other offense that may preclude you from being employed with a financial institution;
(ii) you are grossly negligent in the performance of your duties or have failed to
perform the duties of your employment, including, without limitation, failure to comply with any
lawful directive from your Employer or the Corporation, other than by reason of incapacity due to
disability or from any permitted leave of absence required by law;
(iii) you have violated the Corporation’s Code of Conduct or any of the policies of the
Corporation or your Employer governing the conduct of business or your employment, including
without limitation, those relating to discrimination and retaliation;
(iv) you have engaged in any misconduct which has the effect or potential of being
injurious to the Corporation, any Affiliate or your Employer, including, but not limited to, its
reputation;
(v) you have engaged in an act of fraud or dishonesty, including, but not limited to,
taking or failing to take actions intending to result in personal gain; or
2
(vi) if you are employed outside the United States, any other circumstances (beyond
those listed above) that permit the immediate termination of your employment without notice or
payment in accordance with the terms of your employment agreement or Applicable Laws (as
defined in Section 5.2).
The determination of whether your actions will be considered Cause for purposes of these Terms and
Conditions will be determined by the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, at its or their sole discretion, as
applicable. Any determinations of Cause will be considered conclusive and binding on you.
 2.2 Specified Terminations of Employment.
 (a) Death. If you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer by reason of your
death prior to the date that your PSUs become fully vested, all unvested PSUs may vest as provided in
Section 2.1(a) above following completion of the Performance Period and the balance of the PSUs that do
not vest with respect to the Performance Period shall be deemed forfeited at the end of the Performance
Period. In such case, the Corporation will issue your legal representative or your estate the vested PSUs
settled in shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.
 [(b) Retirement Rule. If you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer by
reason of your retirement as determined by your Employer (i) on or after your attainment of age 60, and
(ii) the combination of your age and years of credited employment with your Employer (in both instances,
full and partial years) on your Termination Date equals or exceeds 65 (a “Retirement-Eligible Event”),
all unvested PSUs may vest as provided in Section 2.1(a) above following completion of the Performance
Period, so long as you fully comply with the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof and
provided that, if requested by your Employer, you execute and do not revoke a Transition/Separation
Agreement and Release acceptable to your Employer. The balance of the PSUs that do not vest with
respect to the Performance Period shall be deemed forfeited at the end of the Performance Period. As a
condition for continued vesting of your PSUs (including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalent
rights) following a Retirement-Eligible Event, the Corporation and/or your Employer may require you to
periodically certify your compliance with the covenants set forth in Section 3 of these Terms and
Conditions as more fully described in such Section. For purposes of the foregoing, partial years shall be
determined based upon the number of days since your prior birthday or the number of days of credited
employment since your prior employment anniversary, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the case of continued vesting following a Retirement-Eligible Event, if you commence
employment with a new employer that grants you a new award that replaces all or any portion of this
award, any portion of this award that has been replaced by your new employer will be forfeited and will
no longer vest and, where relevant, will be promptly repaid by you if the award or any portion of this
award has already vested.]
(c) Termination Providing Transition/Separation Pay. Provided that you execute and do not
revoke a Transition/Separation Agreement and Release acceptable to your Employer, if you cease to be
continuously employed with your Employer by reason of a termination by your Employer (or such other
termination of employment that qualifies you for transition/separation pay under a plan, program or
policy of the Corporation or your Employer) and in connection with such termination you receive
transition/separation pay from the Corporation or your Employer, all unvested PSUs may vest as provided
in Section 2.1(a) above following completion of the Performance Period so long as you fully comply with
the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof. As a condition for continued vesting of your PSUs,
the Corporation and/or your Employer may require you to periodically certify your compliance with the
3
covenants set forth in Section 3 of these Terms and Conditions as more fully described in such Section.
The balance of the PSUs that do not vest with respect to the Performance Period shall be deemed forfeited
at the end of the Performance Period. For purposes of the foregoing, “transition/separation pay” means
any severance, redundancy or ex-gratia compensation payment to you from the Corporation or your
Employer in connection with your termination of employment that is in excess of the amount payable to
you on account of any notice period to which you are entitled pursuant to the terms of your contract of
employment or otherwise (or payment in lieu of such notice).
 (d) Sale of Business. If you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer due to a
sale of a business unit or your Employer and you are not otherwise entitled to transition/separation pay,
all unvested PSUs may vest as provided in Section 2.1(a) above following completion of the Performance
Period so long as you fully comply with the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof. The
balance of the PSUs that do not vest with respect to the Performance Period shall be deemed forfeited at
the end of the Performance Period.
 (e) Change in Control. If your employment is terminated by your Employer without Cause
within two (2) years after a Change in Control occurring after the Grant Date, and your PSU award is
assumed, substituted or replaced in connection with such Change in Control, all unvested PSUs may vest
as provided in Section 2.1(a) above following completion of the Performance Period so long as you fully
comply with the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof. The balance of the PSUs that do not
vest with respect to the Performance Period shall be deemed forfeited at the end of the Performance
Period. In the event that your PSU award is not assumed, substituted or replaced in connection with a
Change in Control occurring after the Grant Date including if such a Change in Control occurs following
termination of employment, your unvested PSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, will become
fully vested as of the date of the Change in Control (such date then being the vesting date) and will be
settled in cash, shares or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee (except to the extent that
settlement of your PSUs must remain payable on the vesting date as reflected in the Award Notice in
order to comply with Section 409A or other Applicable Laws).
(f) Termination of Employment Prior to the Grant Date. If your Termination Date (as
defined in Section 2.1(b) above) occurred prior to the Grant Date for this award, you agree that any
references to you as an “employee” and “employment” in the Award Agreement means the period of time
during which you were still an employee of the Corporation or any of its Affiliates.
[Additional Vesting Provisions, if any.]
2.3 Disability. If you receive current benefits under a long-term disability plan maintained
by the Corporation or your Employer while any portion of your PSUs remains unvested, all unvested
PSUs will remain eligible to vest as provided in Section 2.1(a) above following completion of the
Performance Period so long as you are eligible to receive such benefits provided you fully comply with
the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof. The balance of the PSUs that do not vest with
respect to the Performance Period shall be deemed forfeited at the end of the Performance Period.
SECTION 3: Notice of Resignation, Non-Solicitation, Non-Competition, Confidential Information,
Non-Disparagement and Cooperation

3.1 Notice of Resignation. As consideration for this award, you will provide your Employer
with 180 days’ advance written notice of any voluntary termination of your employment with your
4
Employer or such longer period as may be set forth in any other agreement that you may have with the
Corporation or your Employer or any policy of the Corporation or of your Employer.
3.2 Non-Solicitation of Clients, Contractors and Employees; Non-Competition.
To protect the Corporation’s and its Affiliates’ legitimate business interests, including its
confidential information and goodwill, and for the good and valuable consideration offered pursuant to
the Award Agreement, which is in excess of any consideration you are otherwise entitled to receive, and
to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree as follows:
(a) Non-Solicitation of Clients, Contractors and Employees. Your PSUs, whether vested
(but unsettled) or unvested, and including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalent rights, shall be
immediately forfeited if, prior to one (1) year from the Termination Date or, if later, the final vesting date
set forth in the Award Notice (the “Restricted Period”), you directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, divert or
appropriate, or attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate for the benefit of any Competitive Enterprise any
client or prospective client of the Corporation or an Affiliate with whom you had contact, or with respect
to whom you obtained or had access to Confidential Information, or whose identity you learned, during
your employment with your Employer; (ii) interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt any relationship,
contractual or otherwise, between the Corporation or an Affiliate and any of its respective clients or
prospective clients with whom you had contact, or with respect to whom you obtained or had access to
Confidential Information, or whose identity you learned, during your employment with your Employer, or
otherwise cause, induce or encourage any such client to diminish or terminate its relationship with the
Corporation or an Affiliate; or (iii) hire or employ any employee or contractor of the Corporation or an
Affiliate, or influence, solicit or induce such an individual or entity to terminate or diminish their
employment or engagement, whichever is applicable, with the Corporation or an Affiliate. For purposes
of the Award Agreement, “prospective clients” means any person or entity with whom the Corporation
or an Affiliate is or was engaged for the purposes of entering into a client or business relationship within
the twelve (12) months preceding your Termination Date. During the Restricted Period, you agree to (i)
advise any person or entity that seeks to employ you of the terms of these covenants; and (ii) immediately
notify People Team equity administration if you are not in compliance with your obligations above.
(b) Non-Competition. Your PSUs, whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including
any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalent rights, shall be immediately forfeited if, after your
separation from employment with the Corporation or its Affiliates by reason of your (i) RetirementEligible Event or (ii) termination providing transition/separation pay as specified in Sections 2.2(b) and
2.2(c) respectively, and before the end of the Restricted Period, you, directly or indirectly (without the
prior written consent of the Corporation), (i) associate (including as a director, officer, employee, partner,
consultant, investor, agent or advisor) with a Competitive Enterprise, or (ii) transact business on behalf of
a Competitive Enterprise. For purposes of the Award Agreement, “Competitive Enterprise” means any
business enterprise, person or entity: (i) that is a member of any of the Corporation’s competitive peer
groups as disclosed in the Corporation’s proxy statement that was most recently filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission preceding the Termination Date; or (ii) that is otherwise engaged in or is
undertaking efforts to engage in any actual or planned or substantially similar service offering of the
Corporation or the Affiliate, product line of the Corporation or the Affiliate, or any other business of the
Corporation or an Affiliate within the two (2) years preceding your Termination Date; or (iii) for whom
you would otherwise be performing services through which you would disclose or inevitably disclose
Confidential Information. However, nothing in the Award Agreement shall preclude you from investing
your personal assets in the securities of any Competitive Enterprise if such securities are (i) traded on a
national stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market and if such investment is as a passive investor
5
and if such investment does not result in you beneficially owning, at any time, more than five (5%) of the
publicly-traded equity securities of such competitor; or (ii) not traded on a national stock exchange or in
the over-the-counter market and if such investment is as a passive investor and such investment does not
result in you beneficially owning, at any time, more than five (5%) of any class of equity securities of
such competitor. You acknowledge and agree that the Corporation’s and its Affiliates’ business is global
in nature, and in light of your executive level role and responsibilities and your access to Confidential
Information concerning the Corporation’s and its Affiliates’ global operations, in providing your services
to your Employer you will have a material presence or influence on behalf of your Employer throughout
the world. You further acknowledge and agree that, in light of current technology, your services and the
business of any Competitive Enterprise can be conducted anywhere in the world.
For the sake of clarity, the foregoing non-compete restriction does not prohibit you from being employed
by the government or a not-for profit organization (i.e. an organization exempt from local and national tax
laws). In view of the limited scope of the non-compete obligation assumed under this Section, which
does not prevent you from working in other entities that are not affected by it, you acknowledge and agree
that: (i) the foregoing non-compete obligation is reasonable and necessary to protect the Corporation’s
and its Affiliates’ legitimate business interests including its confidential information and goodwill, and
(ii) the ability to continue to vest in your PSUs, including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalent
rights, following a Retirement-Eligible Event or termination providing transition/separation pay is fair
and reasonable consideration for the foregoing non-compete obligation. During the Restricted Period, you
further agree to (i) advise any person or entity that seeks to employ you of the terms of these covenants;
and (ii) immediately notify People Team equity administration if you are not in compliance with your
obligations above (i.e., if you begin to associate with or transact business on behalf of a Competitive
Enterprise).
3.3 Confidential Information.
(a) Except as may be permitted in accordance with Section 3.6 below, during the course of
your employment with the Corporation or any Affiliate and continuing thereafter, you will maintain in
secrecy all Confidential Information of the Corporation and its Affiliates and will not, either directly or
indirectly, at any time, while an employee of the Corporation or any Affiliate or thereafter, make known,
divulge, reveal, furnish, make available, disclose, appropriate or use (except for use in the regular course
of your duties for the Corporation or its Affiliates) any Confidential Information (as defined below)
without the written consent of the Corporation. Upon the Termination Date, or any time the Corporation
makes a request, you will deliver promptly to the Corporation all Confidential Information and all copies
of Confidential Information, or any analyses, compilations, summaries, studies, or other documents
based, in whole or in part, upon the Confidential Information and, to the extent any Confidential
Information is stored on any PDA or personal computer, cloud, email account or other storage device,
you will fully cooperate with the Corporation or its Affiliates to return and permanently delete all such
Confidential Information from such devices. Upon the Corporation’s request, you agree to provide
access to any such device(s) to the Corporation or a third-party vendor selected by the Corporation to
assist with such identification and removal of Confidential Information and Corporation material in a
manner that includes steps to protect your personal information. Upon the Corporation’s request at any
time, you will certify in writing to the Corporation that no Confidential Information or any analyses,
compilations, summaries, studies, or other documents based, in whole or in part, upon the Confidential
Information, remains in your possession or control. You also agree that this obligation is in addition to,
and not in limitation or preemption of, all other obligations of confidentiality that you may have to the
Corporation or its Affiliates under the Code of Conduct, Securities Trading Policy or other rules or
6
policies governing the conduct of their respective businesses, or general or specific legal or equitable
principles.
(b) As used herein, “Confidential Information” means the information you have been
given or to which you have access or become informed of, directly or indirectly, which the Corporation
or its Affiliates possess or have access and which relates to the Corporation or its Affiliates, is not
generally known to the public or in the trade or is a competitive asset and/or otherwise constitutes a
“trade secret,” as that term is defined by Applicable Laws, of the Corporation or its Affiliates, including
without limitation, non- public: (i) planning data and marketing strategies, including marketing ideas,
mailing lists, and sales and marketing plans; (ii) terms of any new products and investment strategies;
(iii) information relating to other officers and employees of the Corporation or its Affiliates, including
personal information, social security numbers, medical information, addresses, and telephone numbers;
(iv) financial results and information about the business condition of the Corporation or its Affiliates,
including results and data about Corporation conditions, operations, strategies and plans, pending
projects and proposals, and potential acquisitions or divestitures; (v) terms of any investment,
management or advisory agreement or other material contract; (vi) proprietary software and other
product or technical information, including product formulations, new product ideas, new business
developments, plans, designs, compilations, methods, processes, procedures, program devices, data or
market information processing programs, hardware firmware, research and development products, and
related documents and information; (vii) customer and potential customer information, including client
lists, prospecting lists, information about client accounts, pricing strategies, and current or proposed
transactions and contact persons at such customers and customer prospects); and (viii) material
information or internal analyses concerning customers or customer prospects of the Corporation or its
Affiliates or their respective operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or plans. Confidential
Information does not include information which: (i) was or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by you or any of your agents, advisors or representatives or the
wrongdoing of a third party; (ii) was within your possession prior to its being furnished to you by or on
behalf of the Corporation or its Affiliates, provided that the source of the information was not bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Corporation or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information
to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation or otherwise wrongfully came into possession of
such information; or (iii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Corporation or its Affiliates, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the Corporation or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to you by a
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation or otherwise wrongfully came into possession of such
information.
(c) You acknowledge and agree that the Confidential Information is not generally known or
available to the general public; has been developed, compiled, and/or acquired by the Corporation or its
Affiliates at their great effort and expense; and includes such information as it exists in any form,
including written, oral, electronic, digital or other form. You further acknowledge that disclosing,
divulging, revealing or using any Confidential Information, other than on behalf of the Corporation and
its Affiliates, would be highly detrimental to the Corporation and its Affiliates, and that immediate and
irreparable harm to the Corporation and its Affiliates, including loss of business and financial damage,
would result therefrom.
3.4 Non-Disparagement. Subject to Section 3.6 below, during the course of your
employment with the Corporation or any Affiliate and continuing thereafter, you will not, directly or
indirectly make, issue, authorize or publish any comments or statements (orally or in writing) to the
media, including without limitation traditional vehicles and social media, to any individual or entity with
7
whom or which the Corporation, or any of its Affiliates, has a business relationship, or to any other
individual or entity, which disparages, criticizes or otherwise reflects adversely upon the Corporation,
any of its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers or directors.
3.5 Cooperation. Upon the termination of your employment for any reason or no reason,
including but not limited to resignation of employment, you will fully cooperate with the Corporation and
its Affiliates upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, in the prosecution and defense of
complaints, investigations, litigation, arbitration and mediation of any complaints, claims or actions now
in existence or that may be threatened or brought in the future relating to events or occurrences that
transpired while employed by the Corporation or any Affiliate.
3.6 Governmental Authorities. Nothing in the Award Agreement prohibits or interferes with
your right to disclose any relevant and necessary information in any action or proceeding relating to the
Award Agreement or as otherwise required by law or legal process. In addition, nothing in the Award
Agreement prohibits or interferes with your or your attorney’s right: (a) to initiate communications
directly with or report or disclose possible violations of law or regulation to, any governmental agency or
entity, legislative body, or any self-regulatory organization, including but not limited to the U.S.
Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the U.S.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (“EEOC”), or U.S. Congress, and such reports or disclosures do not require prior notice to,
or authorization from, the Corporation; (b) to participate, cooperate, or testify in any action, investigation
or proceeding with, provide information to, or respond to any inquiry from any governmental agency or
legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, including but not limited to the IRS, SEC, FINRA, the
EEOC, DOJ, U.S. Congress (“Governmental Authorities”), or the Corporation’s Legal or Compliance
Departments and such communications do not require prior notice to, or authorization from the
Corporation. However, with respect to such communications, reports, participation, cooperation or
testimony to the Governmental Authorities, as set forth above in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section, you
may not disclose privileged communications with the Corporation’s counsel. To the extent permitted by
law, upon receipt of a subpoena, court order or other legal process compelling the disclosure of any
information, you will give prompt written notice to the Corporation so as to provide the Corporation
ample opportunity to protect its interests in confidentiality to the fullest extent possible unless the
subpoena, court order or other legal process pertains to an action described above in clauses (a) or (b) of
this Section, in which event no such notice is required. Notwithstanding any confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations you may have, you are hereby advised as follows pursuant to the U.S. Federal
Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016: “An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any
Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a
Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely
for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or
other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual
who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose
the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court
proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does
not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.”
3.7 Periodic Certification of Compliance. In connection with your separation from
employment with the Corporation or its Affiliates, upon request by your Employer, you agree to
periodically certify your compliance with the covenants set forth in this Section 3 through the end of the
Restricted Period. If you fail to provide any such certification(s) as requested by your Employer, the
8
PSUs whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including any PSUs resulting from dividend
equivalent rights, shall be immediately forfeited.
3.8 Existing Obligations. The terms of the Award Agreement shall not in any way (a) limit
your obligations pursuant to any other agreements with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates or other
corporate plans or policies applicable to you; or (b) limit the Corporation’s or your Employer’s rights to
exercise any remedies it may have under Applicable Laws or under the terms of such other agreements,
plans or policies.
3.9 Failure to Comply with Covenants. If you fail to comply with any of the foregoing
applicable covenants, the PSUs, whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including any PSUs
resulting from dividend equivalent rights, shall be immediately forfeited and may be subject to repayment
as provided in Section 5.4 of these Terms and Conditions. The Corporation and any Affiliate that
employs or employed you on the applicable date has the right to enforce Section 3 of these Terms and
Conditions.
SECTION 4: Settlement
 4.1 Time of Settlement.
(a) Time of Settlement. Vested PSUs shall be settled within two and one-half (2 ½) months
following the end of the Performance Period, contingent upon the Committee’s determination of the
earnout achieved and subject to the individual per-employee limitations included in the Plan; provided, if
you are a “specified employee” under Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”), upon separation from service and if such settlement is deferred compensation
conditioned upon a separation from service and not compensation you could receive without separating
from service, then settlement shall not be made until the first day following the six (6) month anniversary
of your separation from service (or upon your death, if earlier).
(b) Acceleration Due to Conflicts of Interest or Ethics Laws (Governmental Service).
Notwithstanding Section 4.1(a), the Corporation may accelerate the vesting and settlement of all or part of
your outstanding PSUs if each of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) you cease to be continuously
employed with your Employer by reason of an event described in Section 2.2(b), (c), (d), or (e); (ii)
pursuant to such section, you continue to vest in your PSUs following your Termination Date; (iii)
following your Termination Date, you become employed by a Governmental Employer; and (iv) you
present the Corporation with satisfactory evidence demonstrating that as a result of such employment with
a Governmental Employer, the divestiture of your PSUs is reasonably necessary to avoid the violation of
United States federal, state or local conflicts of interest or ethics law applicable to you; provided that, no
accelerated distribution shall occur pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) unless the Corporation determines that
such acceleration is consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(iii)(B). In the event that
the Corporation determines to accelerate the vesting and settlement of your PSUs in accordance with this
Section 4.1(b), the number of PSUs which shall be vested and settled shall be equal to the lesser of (I) the
number of PSUs that would have vested in accordance with the applicable subsection of Section 2.2 if
Performance Goals were achieved resulting in a final earnout percentage of 100% (target), (II) the number
of PSUs that would have vested in accordance with the applicable subsection of Section 2.2 if the
Performance Period ended with the last Corporation quarter ending simultaneously with or before your
commencement of employment at a Governmental Employer for which the respective Form 10-K or
Form 10-Q has been filed with the SEC (or such other date as determined by the Corporation in its
9
discretion for which performance results are readily ascertainable), subject to any adjustments as
determined by the Corporation in its discretion in light of the truncated Performance Period, or (III) such
other amount as determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion. In the event that vesting and
settlement of the PSUs are accelerated pursuant to this Section 4.1(b), you shall remain subject to these
Terms and Conditions as if the PSUs had remained outstanding through the original vesting date and had
been settled in accordance with Section 4.1(a), including, but not limited to, for purposes of (A)
determining the duration of the Restricted Period set forth in Section 3.2 (so that the Restricted Period
shall be determined based on the originally scheduled vesting date without regard to any acceleration) and
(B) determining whether the PSUs have been settled for purposes of Section 3.9 (so that the PSUs shall
not be deemed to have been vested or settled until the date on which they would have been vested or
settled (as applicable) without regard to acceleration under this Section 4.1(b)). In the event that the
settlement of the PSUs is accelerated in accordance with this Section 4.1(b), upon such settlement, you
shall cease to have any further rights with respect to your PSUs, and for the avoidance of doubt, any PSUs
which are not settled shall be deemed immediately forfeited. As a condition for acceleration pursuant to
this Section 4.1(b), the Corporation may require that you sign an agreement satisfactory to the
Corporation addressing the circumstances of such acceleration and acknowledging these Terms and
Conditions. For purposes of this Section 4.1(b), “Governmental Employer” means a United States
federal, state or local governmental agency, branch, department, or entity and any court or other tribunal.
 4.2 Form of Settlement. PSUs, including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalents,
shall be settled in the form of Common Stock delivered in book-entry form, except as determined by the
Committee as provided in Section 2.2(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as determined by
the Committee as provided in Section 2.2(e), the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, (a) settle any
vested PSUs in the form of a cash payment, or (b) settle any vested PSUs in the form of Common Stock
but require an immediate sale of such shares of Common Stock (in which case, these Terms and
Conditions shall give the Corporation the authority to issue sales instructions on your behalf).
SECTION 5: Other Terms and Conditions
 5.1 No Right to Employment. Neither the award of PSUs nor anything else contained in
these Terms and Conditions nor the Plan shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right of your Employer to
terminate your employment at any time, for any reason, with or without Cause.
 5.2 Compliance with Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and
Conditions, you agree to take any action, and consent to the taking of any action by the Corporation and
your Employer with respect to the PSUs awarded hereunder necessary to achieve compliance with
applicable laws, regulations or relevant regulatory requirements or interpretations in effect from time to
time (“Applicable Laws”). Any determination by the Corporation in this regard shall be final, binding
and conclusive. The Corporation shall in no event be obligated to register any securities pursuant to the
U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as the same shall be in effect from time to time) or other applicable foreign
securities laws, or to take any other affirmative action in order to cause the delivery of shares in bookentry form or otherwise therefore to comply with any Applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, you
understand and agree that if any payment or other obligation under or arising from these Terms and
Conditions, including without limitation dividend equivalent rights, or the Plan is in conflict with or is
restricted by any Applicable Laws, the Corporation may reduce, revoke, cancel, clawback or impose
different terms and conditions to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, to
effect such compliance. If the Corporation determines that it is necessary or appropriate for any payments
under these Terms and Conditions to be delayed in order to avoid additional tax, interest and or penalties
under Section 409A of the Code, then the payments would not be made before the date which is the first
10
day following the six (6) month anniversary of the date of your termination of employment (or upon
earlier death).
5.3 Tax Withholding. Regardless of any action the Corporation or your Employer take with
respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local taxes or non-U.S. taxes), social
insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), you
acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your
responsibility and that the Corporation and your Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings
regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the PSUs, including
the grant of the PSUs, the vesting of the PSUs, the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock
acquired pursuant to the PSUs and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents (including any
PSUs resulting from dividend equivalents), and (b) do not commit to structure the terms of the grant or
any aspect of the PSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items. Further, if you are or
become subject to taxation in more than one country you acknowledge that the Corporation and/or your
Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related
Items in more than one country.
Prior to the delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the vesting of your PSUs, if your country of
residence (and/or the country of employment, if different) requires withholding or payment of TaxRelated Items, the Corporation shall be authorized to withhold a sufficient number of whole shares of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the vesting of the PSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market
Value sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the shares of
Common Stock. The cash equivalent of the shares of Common Stock withheld will be used to settle the
obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items. In the event that withholding in shares of Common Stock
is prohibited or problematic under Applicable Laws or otherwise may trigger adverse consequences to the
Corporation or your Employer, your Employer is authorized to withhold the Tax-Related Items required
to be withheld with respect to the shares of Common Stock in cash from your regular salary and/or wages
or any other amounts payable to you. In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through
the withholding of shares of Common Stock by the Corporation or through your regular salary and/or
wages or other amounts payable to you by your Employer, no shares of Common Stock will be issued to
you (or your estate) upon vesting of the PSUs unless and until satisfactory arrangements have been made
by you with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items that the Corporation or your Employer
determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such PSUs. By accepting
this grant of PSUs, you expressly consent to the withholding of shares of Common Stock and/or
withholding from your regular salary and/or wages or other amounts payable to you as provided for
hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to the PSUs and any shares of Common Stock delivered
in payment thereof are your sole responsibility. Without limiting the Corporation’s or your Employer’s
authority to satisfy their withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items as set forth herein, by accepting
this grant of PSUs, you authorize the Corporation and/or your Employer to withhold shares of Common
Stock otherwise deliverable to you upon vesting of your PSUs to satisfy Tax-Related Items, regardless of
whether the Corporation and/or your Employer have an obligation to withhold such Tax-Related Items.
The Corporation or your Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering
applicable statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in your
jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount
in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Common Stock). In the event of under-withholding, you
may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the
Corporation and/or your Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in
shares of Common Stock, you shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common
11
Stock subject to the vested PSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held
back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
 5.4 Forfeiture and Repayment. If, directly or indirectly:
 (a) during the course of your employment with your Employer, you violate any obligations
set forth in the Award Agreement (including without limitation those obligations set forth in Section 3 of
these Terms and Conditions) or engage in conduct or it is discovered that you engaged in conduct that is
adverse to the interests of the Corporation or its Affiliates, including but not limited to failures to comply
with the Corporation’s or any of its Affiliate’s rules or regulations, fraud, or conduct contributing to any
financial restatements or irregularities;
(b) during the course of your employment with your Employer, you engage (other than for
the benefit of the Corporation or its Affiliates) in solicitation and/or diversion of customers or employees;
(c) during the course of your employment with your Employer, you engage in competition
with the Corporation or its Affiliates;
(d) following termination of your employment with your Employer for any reason, with or
without Cause, you violate any post-termination obligations or duties owed to the Corporation or its
Affiliates under any agreement with the Corporation or its Affiliates, including without limitation, any
employment, confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition or other agreement restricting postemployment conduct (including without limitation those obligations set forth in Section 3 of these Terms
and Conditions); or
(e) any compensation that the Corporation or its Affiliates has promised or paid to you is
required to be forfeited and/or repaid to the Corporation or its Affiliates pursuant to applicable regulatory
requirements;
then the Corporation may cancel all or any portion of the PSUs and/or require repayment of any sums
(including, in the case of shares of Common Stock, the value of those shares of Common Stock) or other
amounts which were acquired pursuant to the PSUs (including without limitation any dividends paid on
the shares of Common Stock and dividend equivalents). The Corporation shall have sole discretion to
determine what constitutes grounds for forfeiture and/or repayment under this Section 5.4, and, in such
event, the portion of the PSUs that shall be cancelled and the sums or amounts that shall be repaid. For
purposes of the foregoing, you expressly and explicitly authorize the Corporation to issue instructions, on
your behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Corporation to hold the
shares of Common Stock and other amounts acquired pursuant to the PSUs to re-convey, transfer or
otherwise return such shares and/or other amounts to the Corporation.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Corporation will also cancel all or any portion of the PSUs and/or require
repayment of any shares of Common Stock (or the value thereof) and other amounts which were acquired
pursuant to the PSUs (including without limitation any dividends paid on the shares of Common Stock
and dividend equivalents) as required by Applicable Laws and/or the Corporation’s Policy for the
Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation (the “Recovery Policy”), if
applicable. To the extent that you are subject to the Recovery Policy, you agree that, notwithstanding the
terms of any indemnification arrangement or insurance policy, the Corporation shall not indemnify you
against the loss of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined in the Recovery
Policy), including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of insurance obtained by you to fund
12
amounts recoverable under the Recovery Policy. In order to satisfy any recoupment obligation arising
under any clawback or recovery policy of the Corporation or otherwise under Applicable Laws, you
expressly and explicitly authorize the Corporation to issue instructions, on your behalf, to any brokerage
firm or stock plan service provider engaged by the Corporation to hold any shares of Common Stock or
other amounts acquired pursuant to the PSUs to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return the shares of
Common Stock and/or other amounts to the Corporation upon the Corporation’s enforcement of any
clawback or recovery policy or Applicable Laws.
 5.5 Governing Law and Choice of Forum. The Award Agreement shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, other than any choice of law provisions
calling for the application of laws of another jurisdiction. For purposes of litigating any dispute that
arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or the Award
Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of New
York and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of New York County, New York,
or the federal courts for the United States for the Southern District of New York, and no other courts,
where this grant is made and/or to be performed and agree to such other choice of forum provisions as are
included in the Plan.
5.6 Nature of Plan. By participating in the Plan, you acknowledge, understand and agree
that:
(a) The Plan is discretionary in nature and limited in duration, and may be amended,
cancelled, or terminated by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, at any time.
(b) The grant of PSUs under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any
contractual or other right to receive PSUs or benefits in lieu of such awards in the future. Future awards,
if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, the form and timing
of the award, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the award, the vesting provisions
applicable to the award and the purchase price (if any).
(c) Your participation in the Plan is voluntary, and the value of your PSUs is an
extraordinary item of compensation and is outside the scope of your employment (and your employment
contract, if any). As such, your PSUs are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of
calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, dismissal, termination or end of service payments,
bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits, or similar payments.
(d) No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the
PSUs or recoupment of any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan resulting from (i) the
termination of your employment or other service relationship (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or
the terms of your employment agreement, if any) and/or (ii) the application of any recoupment policy or
any recovery or clawback policy otherwise required by law. In consideration of the grant of the PSUs,
you expressly agree not to institute any such claim against the Corporation, any of its Affiliates or
your Employer.
 5.7 Data Privacy. By accepting the PSUs, you declare that you agree with the data
processing practices described herein and consent to the collection, processing and use of your
Personal Data (as defined below) by the Corporation and the transfer of your Personal Data to the
recipients mentioned herein, including recipients located in countries which do not adduce an
13
adequate level of protection from a European (or other non-U.S.) data protection law perspective, for
the purposes described herein.
(a) Declaration of Consent. You understand that you need to review the following
information about the processing of your personal data by or on behalf of the Corporation, your
Employer and/or any of its Affiliates, as described herein, and any other PSU grant materials (the
“Personal Data”) and declare your consent. With regard to the processing of your Personal Data in
connection with the Plan, you understand that the Corporation is the controller of the Personal Data.
(b) Data Processing and Legal Basis. The Corporation collects, uses and otherwise
processes your Personal Data for the purposes of allocating shares and implementing, administering
and managing the Plan. You understand that this Personal Data may include, without limitation, your
name, home address and telephone number, email address, personal bank account details, date of
birth, social insurance number, passport number or other identification number (e.g., resident
registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of Common Stock or directorships held in
the Corporation or its Affiliates, details of all PSUs or any other entitlement to shares of Common
Stock or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in your
favor. The Corporation’s legal basis for the processing of your Personal Data is your consent.
(c) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. You understand that the Corporation
may transfer your Personal Data, or parts thereof, to Fidelity Stock Plan Services LLC and certain of
its affiliated companies (“Fidelity”), an independent service provider based in the United States which
assists the Corporation with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. In the
future, the Corporation may select a different service provider and share your Personal Data with such
different service provider that serves the Corporation in a similar manner. You understand and
acknowledge that the Corporation’s service provider may open an account for you to receive and trade
shares acquired under the Plan and that you will be asked to agree on separate terms and data
processing practices with the service provider, which is a condition of your ability to participate in the
Plan.
(d) International Data Transfers. You understand that the Corporation and, as of the date
hereof, certain third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the
Plan, such as the Corporation’s service providers, are based in the United States. If you are located
outside the United States, you understand and acknowledge that your country has enacted data privacy
laws that are different from the laws of the United States. Transfers of personal data from the EU to
the United States can be made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European
Commission or other appropriate safeguards permissible under the Applicable Laws. If you are
located in the EU or EEA, the Corporation may receive, process and transfer your Personal Data
onward to third-party service providers solely on the basis of appropriate data transfer agreements or
other appropriate safeguards permissible under Applicable Laws. If applicable, you understand that
you can ask for a copy of the appropriate data processing agreements underlying the transfer of your
Personal Data by contacting your local People Team representative. The Corporation’s legal basis for
the transfer of your Personal Data is your consent.
(e) Data Retention. You understand that the Corporation will use your Personal Data only
as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan, or to
comply with Applicable Laws, including under tax and securities laws. In the latter case, you
understand and acknowledge that the Corporation’s legal basis for the processing of your Personal
Data would be compliance with the Applicable Laws or the pursuit by the Corporation of respective
14
legitimate interests not outweighed by your interests, rights or freedoms. When the Corporation no
longer needs your Personal Data for any of the above purposes, you understand the Corporation will
remove it from its systems.
(f) Voluntariness and Consequences of Denial/Withdrawal of Consent. You understand
that your participation in the Plan and your grant of consent is purely voluntary. You may deny or
later withdraw your consent at any time, with future effect and for any or no reason. If you deny or
later withdraw your consent, the Corporation can no longer offer you participation in the Plan or offer
other awards to you or administer or maintain such awards and you would no longer be able to
participate in the Plan. You further understand that denial or withdrawal of your consent would not
affect your status or salary as an employee or your career and that you would merely forfeit the
opportunities associated with the Plan.
(g) Data Subject Rights. You understand that data subject rights regarding the processing
of personal data vary depending on the Applicable Laws and that, depending on where you are based
and subject to the conditions set out in the Applicable Laws, you may have, without limitation, the
rights to (i) inquire whether and what kind of Personal Data the Corporation holds about you and how
it is processed, and to access or request copies of such Personal Data, (ii) request the correction or
supplementation of Personal Data about you that is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date in light of
the purposes underlying the processing, (iii) obtain the erasure of Personal Data no longer necessary
for the purposes underlying the processing, processed based on withdrawn consent, processed for
legitimate interests that, in the context of your objection, do not prove to be compelling, or processed in
non-compliance with applicable legal requirements, (iv) request the Corporation to restrict the
processing of your Personal Data in certain situations where you feel its processing is inappropriate,
(v) object, in certain circumstances, to the processing of Personal Data for legitimate interests, and to
(vi) request portability of your Personal Data that you have actively or passively provided to the
Corporation (which does not include data derived or inferred from the collected data), where the
processing of such Personal Data is based on consent or your employment or service contract and is
carried out by automated means. In case of concerns, you understand that you may also have the right
to lodge a complaint with the competent local data protection authority. Further, to receive
clarification of, or to exercise any of your rights, you should contact your local People Team
representative.
5.8 Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws. You may be subject to insider trading restrictions
and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or your broker’s country, if
different, which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common
Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., PSUs) or rights linked to the value of shares of Common
Stock under the Plan during such times as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the
Corporation (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider trading laws and
regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside
information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third
party and (b) “tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties
include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in
addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the
Corporation. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions,
and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.

consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an
on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Corporation or a third party designated by
the Corporation.
5.10 Severability. The provisions of these Terms and Conditions are severable and if any one
or more provisions are determined to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the
remaining provisions shall nevertheless be binding and enforceable. Alternatively, the Corporation, in its
sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to revise or strike such provision to the minimum
extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable to the full extent permitted under Applicable Laws.
 5.11 Construction/Blue Pencil. The headings contained in these Terms and Conditions are for
convenience only and do not constitute part of and shall not be used to interpret these Terms and
Conditions. The language in all parts of these Terms and Conditions shall be construed according to its
fair meaning and not strictly for or against you or the Corporation because that party or that party’s legal
representative drafted it. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, you agree that the
covenants and post-employment restrictions contained in these Terms and Conditions are reasonable
under the circumstances, valid in duration and scope, and necessary to protect the Corporation’s
Confidential Information. It is the desire and intent of the parties, and you agree, that the covenants and
post-employment restrictions contained in these Terms and Conditions shall be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under applicable laws and public policies. Accordingly, if any term or provision of the
covenants or post-employment restrictions contained in these Terms and Conditions or any portion
thereof is declared illegal or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, such court shall have
the right, power and authority to excise or modify such provision or provisions of these covenants so as to
render such provision or portion thereof enforceable, and to the extent such provision or portion thereof
cannot be rendered enforceable, these Terms and Conditions shall be considered divisible as to such
provision, which shall become null and void, leaving the remainder in full force and effect.
 5.12 Liability for Breach. You shall indemnify the Corporation and hold it harmless from and
against any and all damages or liabilities incurred by the Corporation (including liabilities for attorneys’
fees and disbursements) arising out of any breach by you of these Terms and Conditions, including,
without limitation, any attempted transfer of PSUs in violation of Section 1.4 of these Terms and
Conditions.
5.13 Waiver. You acknowledge that a waiver by the Corporation of any provision of these
Terms and Conditions shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision of these Terms
and Conditions, or of any subsequent breach of these Terms and Conditions.
5.14 Addendum. The grant of your PSUs shall be subject to any special terms and conditions
set forth in any Addendum to these Terms and Conditions (the “Addendum”) for your state of residence
(and your state of employment, if different). If you relocate your residency or employment to one of the
states included in the Addendum, the special terms and conditions for such state will apply to you, to the
extent the Corporation determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Addendum shall constitute part of the Award
Agreement.
5.15 Additional Requirements. The Corporation reserves the right to impose other
requirements on the PSUs, any payment made pursuant to the PSUs, and your participation in the Plan, to
16
the extent the Corporation determines, in its sole discretion, that such other requirements are necessary or
advisable for legal or administrative reasons. Such requirements may include (but are not limited to)
requiring you to sign any agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

following provision shall replace Section 3.2 of the Terms and Conditions in its entirety:
3.2 Non-Solicitation of Clients, Contractors and Employees; Non-Competition.
(a) Non-Solicitation of Clients, Contractors and Employees. You are prohibited, without
prior authorization, from using or disclosing the Corporation’s or its Affiliates’ trade secrets at any time,
including without limitation to (i) solicit or induce or attempt to solicit or induce any current or
prospective client of the Corporation or an Affiliate known to you, to initiate or continue a client
relationship with you other than with the Corporation or Affiliate, or to terminate or reduce its client
relationship with the Corporation or Affiliate, or (ii) solicit any employee or contractor to terminate or
reduce their employment or engagement, whichever is applicable, with the Corporation or Affiliate. You
understand and acknowledge that your obligations under this provision will continue indefinitely unless

by the government or a not-for profit organization (i.e. an organization exempt from local and national tax
laws). In view of the limited scope of the non-compete obligation assumed under this Section, which
does not prevent you from working in other entities that are not affected by it, you acknowledge and agree
that: (i) the foregoing non-compete obligation is reasonable and necessary to protect the Corporation’s
legitimate business interests including its confidential information and goodwill, and (ii) the continued
vesting in your PSUs, including any PSUs resulting from dividend equivalent rights, following a
Retirement-Eligible Event or termination providing transition/separation pay is fair and reasonable
consideration for the foregoing non-compete obligation. During the Restricted Period, you further agree
to (i) advise any person or entity that seeks to employ you of the terms of these covenants; and (ii)
immediately notify People Team equity administration if you are not in compliance with your obligations

FORM OF EXHIBIT A
Risk Adjustment/Forfeiture Decision Process
For any performance year in which you remain a covered employee (including as an MRT), your risk performance will be
assessed via a Risk Culture Summary Scorecard (“RCSS”) Rating and/or a Performance Management Platform (“PMP”)
Risk Goal Rating, as applicable. If, in any year, you receive an RCSS Rating or a PMP Risk Goal Rating, as applicable, of
“Partially Met Expectations” or “Did Not Meet Expectations,” your unvested awards (including any accrued dividend
equivalents) will be subject to review by the Incentive Compensation Review Committee (“ICRC”) or the Human Resources
and Compensation Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “HRCC”) for consideration of forfeiture, as
applicable. If you are no longer a covered employee (including as an MRT) or have left the Corporation, any unvested
portion of your awards (including any accrued dividend equivalents) granted while you were a covered employee (including
as an MRT) will also be subject to a risk review by the ICRC/HRCC.
In that event, as part of its review, the ICRC/HRCC will ask –
• Did your rating reflect poor risk behavior by you in a prior year?
• Did you receive an award in that year?
If the answer to both questions is yes, the ICRC/HRCC asks the following questions with respect to each of the designated
prior years:
• Financial Impact: How much did/will the issue cost the Company?
• Reputational Impact: How much of a regulatory impact did/will it have on the Company?
The ICRC/HRCC selects the impact answer that falls into the highest category below to determine the impact forfeiture
percentage.

As used in this Exhibit A, the term “Company” shall mean the Corporation and its Affiliates.

FORM OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS – EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE US
The Restricted Stock Units (“RSUs”) with respect to Common Stock of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation (the “Corporation”) granted to you on the Grant Date are subject to the Notice of Award -
Restricted Stock Units – Executive Committee US (the “Award Notice”), these Terms and Conditions of
Restricted Stock Units – Executive Committee US (the “Terms and Conditions”) and all of the terms
and conditions of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the
“Plan”), which is incorporated herein by reference. In the case of a conflict between the Award Notice,
these Terms and Conditions and the terms of the Plan, the provisions of the Plan shall govern. A copy of
the Plan can be found on the Corporation’s equity award website (the “Award Website”),
NetBenefits.com, under “Quick Links.” Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
same meaning as provided or reflected in the Award Notice or the Plan, as applicable. For purposes of
these Terms and Conditions, “Employer” means the Corporation or any Affiliate that employs or
employed you on the applicable date.
SECTION 1: Restricted Stock Unit Award
 1.1 Grant of Award. Subject to these Terms and Conditions and the terms of the Plan, the
Corporation grants you the number of RSUs as reflected in the Award Notice. The RSUs shall vest in
accordance with the Vesting Schedule and shall be subject to the Risk Adjustment Process (if any) as
reflected in the Award Notice.
 1.2 Dividend Equivalents. Upon the payment of any dividend on the Common Stock
occurring during the period preceding the settlement of your RSUs pursuant to these Terms and
Conditions, your Employer will accrue an amount in cash equal to the value of the dividends you
otherwise would have received had you actually been the shareholder of record of the number of shares of
Common Stock underlying your RSUs, which dividend equivalents will also be subject to the Risk
Adjustment Process if applicable to your award (as indicated in the Award Notice). Such dividend
equivalents will be paid in cash without interest pursuant to Section 4 of these Terms and Conditions if
and to the extent that the underlying RSUs become vested as provided in the Award Agreement.
 1.3 No Voting Rights. Prior to the settlement of your RSUs pursuant to these Terms and
Conditions, you shall not be entitled to vote the shares of Common Stock underlying the RSUs.
 1.4 Nontransferable. The RSUs shall be transferable only by will or the laws of descent and
distribution. Any other attempt to transfer the RSUs shall be null and void.
SECTION 2: Vesting, Forfeiture, Termination of Employment and Disability
 2.1 Vesting and Forfeiture.
 (a) Vesting. Subject to Sections 3 and 5.4 of these Terms and Conditions, if you remain
continuously employed with your Employer through the close of business on the applicable Vesting Date
reflected in the Award Notice, the number of RSUs corresponding to such Vesting Date will vest and the
Corporation will issue you the underlying shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4 of these
Terms and Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Award Agreement and 
in accordance with Section 4.1, a vesting may be delayed if, on the Vesting Date, you are the subject of
ongoing disciplinary or performance management investigations or proceedings concerning
circumstances under which forfeiture or clawback of this award could apply or such other actual or
potential compensation recovery processes are ongoing under which forfeiture or clawback of this award
could apply. In such cases, the applicable portion of the award, if any, will vest following the completion
of such investigations, proceedings and/or processes to the extent the Corporation determines that
forfeiture and/or clawback does not apply.
 (b) Forfeiture upon Termination of Employment. Subject to Sections 2.2 and 2.3 of these
Terms and Conditions, if you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer prior to the date
that your RSUs become fully vested, you shall cease vesting in your RSUs as of your Termination Date
and any unvested RSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, immediately shall terminate and be
forfeited; provided, however, if the Risk Adjustment Process applies to your award (as indicated in the
Award Notice), in situations where vesting would have otherwise occurred but for the fact that a
determination has not yet been made as to whether a risk adjustment pursuant to Exhibit A is required,
vesting shall occur in accordance with the terms of the Award Agreement provided that the Committee
determines the effect, if any of a risk adjustment. As used herein, “Termination Date” shall mean the
last day on which you are an employee of your Employer.
(c) Forfeiture upon Termination of Employment for Cause. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in these Terms and Conditions, if your Employer terminates your employment for
Cause, your RSUs, whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including any dividend equivalent
rights, immediately shall terminate and be forfeited. For purposes of these Terms and Conditions,
“Cause” shall mean:
(i) you have been convicted of, or have entered into a pretrial diversion or entered a
plea of guilty or nolo contendere (plea of no contest) to a crime or offense constituting a felony
(or its equivalent under applicable laws outside of the United States), or to any other crime or
offense involving moral turpitude, dishonesty, fraud, breach of trust, money laundering, or any
other offense that may preclude you from being employed with a financial institution;
(ii) you are grossly negligent in the performance of your duties or have failed to
perform the duties of your employment, including, without limitation, failure to comply with any
lawful directive from your Employer or the Corporation, other than by reason of incapacity due to
disability or from any permitted leave of absence required by law;
(iii) you have violated the Corporation’s Code of Conduct or any of the policies of the
Corporation or your Employer governing the conduct of business or your employment, including
without limitation, those relating to discrimination and retaliation;
(iv) you have engaged in any misconduct which has the effect or potential of being
injurious to the Corporation, any Affiliate or your Employer, including, but not limited to, its
reputation;
(v) you have engaged in an act of fraud or dishonesty, including, but not limited to,
taking or failing to take actions intending to result in personal gain; or
(vi) if you are employed outside the United States, any other circumstances (beyond
those listed above) that permit the immediate termination of your employment without notice or
2
payment in accordance with the terms of your employment agreement or Applicable Laws (as
defined in Section 5.2).
The determination of whether your actions will be considered Cause for purposes of these Terms and
Conditions will be determined by the Corporation or any of its Affiliates, at its or their sole discretion, as
applicable. Any determinations of Cause will be considered conclusive and binding on you.
 2.2 Specified Terminations of Employment.
 (a) Death. If you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer by reason of your
death prior to the date that your RSUs become fully vested (or if your death occurs following termination
of employment during a period in which you have outstanding RSUs), your unvested RSUs including any
dividend equivalent rights, will become fully vested as of your date of death (such date then being the
final Vesting Date) and the Corporation will issue your legal representative or your estate the underlying
shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.
 [(b) Retirement Rule. If you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer by
reason of your retirement as determined by your Employer (i) on or after your attainment of age 60 and
(ii) the combination of your age and years of credited employment with your Employer (in both instances,
full and partial years) on your Termination Date equals or exceeds 65 (a “Retirement-Eligible Event”),
you will continue to vest in your RSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, in accordance with the
Vesting Schedule set forth in the Award Notice so long as you fully comply with the applicable covenants
provided in Section 3 hereof and provided that, if requested by your Employer (to the extent not
prohibited by Applicable Laws), you execute and do not revoke a Transition/Separation Agreement and
Release acceptable to your Employer. As a condition for continued vesting of your RSUs, including any
dividend equivalent rights, following a Retirement-Eligible Event, the Corporation and/or your Employer
may require you to periodically certify your compliance with the covenants set forth in Section 3 of these
Terms and Conditions as more fully described in such Section. For purposes of the foregoing, partial
years shall be determined based upon the number of days since your prior birthday or the number of days
of credited employment since your prior employment anniversary, as the case may be. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (x) this subsection (b) will not apply to your award if the Award Notice provides that
Section 2.2(b) is not applicable; and (y) in the case of continued vesting following a Retirement-Eligible
Event, if you commence employment with a new employer that grants you a new award that replaces all
or any portion of this award, any portion of this award that has been replaced by your new employer will
be forfeited and will no longer vest and, where relevant, will be promptly repaid by you if the award or
any portion of this award has already vested.]
(c) Termination Providing Transition/Separation Pay. Provided that you execute and do not
revoke a Transition/Separation Agreement and Release acceptable to your Employer, if you cease to be
continuously employed with your Employer by reason of a termination by your Employer (or such other
termination of employment that qualifies you for transition/separation pay under a plan, program or
policy of the Corporation or your Employer) and in connection with such termination you receive
transition/separation pay from the Corporation or your Employer, you will continue to vest in your RSUs,
including any dividend equivalent rights, in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Award
Notice so long as you fully comply with the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof. As a
condition for continued vesting of your RSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, the Corporation
and/or your Employer may require you to periodically certify your compliance with the covenants set
forth in Section 3 of these Terms and Conditions as more fully described in such Section. For purposes of
the foregoing, “transition/separation pay” means any severance, redundancy or ex-gratia compensation
3
payment to you from the Corporation or your Employer in connection with your termination of
employment that is in excess of the amount payable to you on account of any notice period to which you
are entitled pursuant to the terms of your contract of employment or otherwise (or payment in lieu of such
notice).
 (d) Sale of Business. If you cease to be continuously employed with your Employer due to a
sale of a business unit or your Employer and you are not otherwise entitled to transition/separation pay,
you will continue to vest in your RSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, in accordance with the
Vesting Schedule set forth in the Award Notice so long as you fully comply with the applicable covenants
provided in Section 3 hereof.
 (e) Change in Control. If your employment is terminated by your Employer without Cause
within two (2) years after a Change in Control occurring after the Grant Date, and your RSU award is
assumed, substituted or replaced in connection with such Change in Control, you will continue to vest in
your RSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in
the Award Notice so long as you fully comply with the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof.
In the event that your RSU award is not assumed, substituted or replaced in connection with a Change in
Control occurring after the Grant Date including if such a Change in Control occurs following termination
of employment, any of your unvested RSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, will become fully
vested as of the date of the Change in Control (such date then being the final Vesting Date) and will be
settled in cash, shares or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee (except to the extent that
settlement of your RSUs must remain payable on the Vesting Date(s) as reflected in the Award Notice in
order to comply with Section 409A or other Applicable Laws).
(f) Termination of Employment Prior to the Grant Date. If your Termination Date (as
defined in Section 2.1(b) above) occurred prior to the Grant Date for this award, you agree that any
references to you as an “employee” and “employment” in the Award Agreement means the period of time
during which you were still an employee of the Corporation or any of its Affiliates.
[Additional Vesting Provisions, if any.]
2.3 Disability. If you receive current benefits under a long-term disability plan maintained
by the Corporation or your Employer while any portion of your RSUs remains unvested, you will
continue to vest in your RSUs during the period you are eligible to receive such benefits, including any
dividend equivalent rights, in accordance with the Vesting Schedule set forth in the Award Notice so long
as you fully comply with the applicable covenants provided in Section 3 hereof.
SECTION 3: Notice of Resignation, Non-Solicitation, Non-Competition, Confidential Information,
Non-Disparagement and Cooperation

3.1 Notice of Resignation. As consideration for this award, you will provide your Employer
with 180 days’ advance written notice of any voluntary termination of your employment with your
Employer or such longer period as may be set forth in any other agreement that you may have with the
Corporation or your Employer or any policy of the Corporation or of your Employer.
3.2 Non-Solicitation of Clients, Contractors and Employees; Non-Competition.
To protect the Corporation’s and its Affiliates’ legitimate business interests, including its
confidential information and goodwill, and for the good and valuable consideration offered pursuant to
4
the Award Agreement, which is in excess of any consideration you are otherwise entitled to receive, and
to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Laws, you agree as follows:
(a) Non-Solicitation of Clients, Contractors and Employees. Your RSUs, whether vested
(but unsettled) or unvested, and including any dividend equivalent rights, shall be immediately forfeited
if, prior to one (1) year from the Termination Date or, if later, the final Vesting Date set forth in the
Award Notice (the “Restricted Period”), you directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, divert or appropriate, or
attempt to solicit, divert or appropriate for the benefit of any Competitive Enterprise any client or
prospective client of the Corporation or an Affiliate with whom you had contact, or with respect to whom
you obtained or had access to Confidential Information, or whose identity you learned, during your
employment with your Employer; (ii) interfere with, disrupt or attempt to disrupt any relationship,
contractual or otherwise, between the Corporation or an Affiliate and any of its respective clients or
prospective clients with whom you had contact, or with respect to whom you obtained or had access to
Confidential Information, or whose identity you learned, during your employment with your Employer, or
otherwise cause, induce or encourage any such client to diminish or terminate its relationship with the
Corporation or an Affiliate; or (iii) hire or employ any employee or contractor of the Corporation or an
Affiliate, or influence, solicit or induce such an individual or entity to terminate or diminish their
employment or engagement, whichever is applicable, with the Corporation or an Affiliate. For purposes
of the Award Agreement, “prospective clients” means any person or entity with whom the Corporation
or an Affiliate is or was engaged for the purposes of entering into a client or business relationship within
the twelve (12) months preceding your Termination Date. During the Restricted Period, you agree to (i)
advise any person or entity that seeks to employ you of the terms of these covenants; and (ii) immediately
notify People Team equity administration if you are not in compliance with your obligations above.
(b) Non-Competition. Your RSUs, whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including
any dividend equivalent rights, shall be immediately forfeited if, after your separation from employment
with the Corporation or its Affiliates by reason of your (i) Retirement-Eligible Event or (ii) termination
providing transition/separation pay as specified in Sections 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) respectively, and before the
end of the Restricted Period, you, directly or indirectly (without the prior written consent of the
Corporation), (i) associate (including as a director, officer, employee, partner, consultant, investor, agent
or advisor) with a Competitive Enterprise, or (ii) transact business on behalf of a Competitive Enterprise.
For purposes of the Award Agreement, “Competitive Enterprise” means any business enterprise, person
or entity: (i) that is a member of any of the Corporation’s competitive peer groups as disclosed in the
Corporation’s proxy statement that was most recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
preceding the Termination Date; or (ii) that is otherwise engaged in or is undertaking efforts to engage in
any actual or planned or substantially similar service offering of the Corporation or the Affiliate, product
line of the Corporation or the Affiliate, or any other business of the Corporation or an Affiliate within the
two (2) years preceding your Termination Date; or (iii) for whom you would otherwise be performing
services through which you would disclose or inevitably disclose Confidential Information. However,
nothing in the Award Agreement shall preclude you from investing your personal assets in the securities
of any Competitive Enterprise if such securities are (i) traded on a national stock exchange or in the overthe-counter market and if such investment is as a passive investor and if such investment does not result
in you beneficially owning, at any time, more than five (5%) of the publicly-traded equity securities of
such competitor; or (ii) not traded on a national stock exchange or in the over-the-counter market and if
such investment is as a passive investor and such investment does not result in you beneficially owning, at
any time, more than five (5%) of any class of equity securities of such competitor. You acknowledge and
agree that the Corporation’s and its Affiliates’ business is global in nature, and in light of your executive
level role and responsibilities and your access to Confidential Information concerning the Corporation’s
and its Affiliates’ global operations, in providing your services to your Employer you will have a material
5
presence or influence on behalf of your Employer throughout the world. You further acknowledge and
agree that, in light of current technology, your services and the business of any Competitive Enterprise
can be conducted anywhere in the world.
For the sake of clarity, the foregoing non-compete restriction does not prohibit you from being employed
by the government or a not-for profit organization (i.e., an organization exempt from local and national
tax laws). In view of the limited scope of the non-compete obligation assumed under this Section, which
does not prevent you from working in other entities that are not affected by it, you acknowledge and agree
that:(i) the foregoing non-compete obligation is reasonable and necessary to protect the Corporation’s and
its Affiliates’ legitimate business interests including its confidential information and goodwill, and (ii) the
continued vesting in your RSUs, including any dividend equivalent rights, following a RetirementEligible Event or termination providing transition/separation pay is fair and reasonable consideration for
the foregoing non-compete obligation. During the Restricted Period, you further agree to (i) advise any
person or entity that seeks to employ you of the terms of these covenants; and (ii) immediately notify
People Team equity administration if you are not in compliance with your obligations above (i.e., if you
begin to associate with or transact business on behalf of a Competitive Enterprise).
3.3 Confidential Information.
(a) Except as may be permitted in accordance with Section 3.6 below, during the course of
your employment with the Corporation or any Affiliate and continuing thereafter, you will maintain in
secrecy all Confidential Information of the Corporation and its Affiliates and will not, either directly or
indirectly, at any time, while an employee of the Corporation or any Affiliate or thereafter, make known,
divulge, reveal, furnish, make available, disclose, appropriate or use (except for use in the regular course
of your duties for the Corporation or its Affiliates) any Confidential Information (as defined below)
without the written consent of the Corporation. Upon the Termination Date, or any time the Corporation
makes a request, you will deliver promptly to the Corporation all Confidential Information and all copies
of Confidential Information, or any analyses, compilations, summaries, studies, or other documents
based, in whole or in part, upon the Confidential Information and, to the extent any Confidential
Information is stored on any PDA or personal computer, cloud, email account or other storage device,
you will fully cooperate with the Corporation or its Affiliates to return and permanently delete all such
Confidential Information from such devices. Upon the Corporation’s request, you agree to provide
access to any such device(s) to the Corporation or a third-party vendor selected by the Corporation to
assist with such identification and removal of Confidential Information and Corporation material in a
manner that includes steps to protect your personal information. Upon the Corporation’s request at any
time, you will certify in writing to the Corporation that no Confidential Information or any analyses,
compilations, summaries, studies, or other documents based, in whole or in part, upon the Confidential
Information, remains in your possession or control. You also agree that this obligation is in addition to,
and not in limitation or preemption of, all other obligations of confidentiality that you may have to the
Corporation or its Affiliates under the Code of Conduct, Securities Trading Policy or other rules or
policies governing the conduct of their respective businesses, or general or specific legal or equitable
principles.
(b) As used herein, “Confidential Information” means the information you have been
given or to which you have access or become informed of, directly or indirectly, which the Corporation
or its Affiliates possess or have access and which relates to the Corporation or its Affiliates, is not
generally known to the public or in the trade or is a competitive asset and/or otherwise constitutes a
“trade secret,” as that term is defined by Applicable Laws, of the Corporation or its Affiliates, including
without limitation, non- public: (i) planning data and marketing strategies, including marketing ideas,
6
mailing lists, and sales and marketing plans; (ii) terms of any new products and investment strategies;
(iii) information relating to other officers and employees of the Corporation or its Affiliates, including
personal information, social security numbers, medical information, addresses, and telephone numbers;
(iv) financial results and information about the business condition of the Corporation or its Affiliates,
including results and data about Corporation conditions, operations, strategies and plans, pending
projects and proposals, and potential acquisitions or divestitures; (v) terms of any investment,
management or advisory agreement or other material contract; (vi) proprietary software and other
product or technical information, including product formulations, new product ideas, new business
developments, plans, designs, compilations, methods, processes, procedures, program devices, data or
market information processing programs, hardware firmware, research and development products, and
related documents and information; (vii) customer and potential customer information, including client
lists, prospecting lists, information about client accounts, pricing strategies, and current or proposed
transactions and contact persons at such customers and customer prospects); and (viii) material
information or internal analyses concerning customers or customer prospects of the Corporation or its
Affiliates or their respective operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or plans. Confidential
Information does not include information which: (i) was or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by you or any of your agents, advisors or representatives or the
wrongdoing of a third party; (ii) was within your possession prior to its being furnished to you by or on
behalf of the Corporation or its Affiliates, provided that the source of the information was not bound by a
confidentiality agreement with the Corporation or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information
to you by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation or otherwise wrongfully came into possession of
such information; or (iii) was or becomes available to you on a non-confidential basis from a source
other than the Corporation or its Affiliates, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the Corporation or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to you by a
contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation or otherwise wrongfully came into possession of such
information.
(c) You acknowledge and agree that the Confidential Information is not generally known or
available to the general public; has been developed, compiled, and/or acquired by the Corporation or its
Affiliates at their great effort and expense; and includes such information as it exists in any form,
including written, oral, electronic, digital or other form. You further acknowledge that disclosing,
divulging, revealing or using any Confidential Information, other than on behalf of the Corporation and
its Affiliates, would be highly detrimental to the Corporation and its Affiliates, and that immediate and
irreparable harm to the Corporation and its Affiliates, including loss of business and financial damage,
would result therefrom.
3.4 Non-Disparagement. Subject to Section 3.6 below, during the course of your
employment with the Corporation or any Affiliate and continuing thereafter, you will not, directly or
indirectly make, issue, authorize or publish any comments or statements (orally or in writing) to the
media, including without limitation traditional vehicles and social media, to any individual or entity with
whom or which the Corporation, or any of its Affiliates, has a business relationship, or to any other
individual or entity, which disparages, criticizes or otherwise reflects adversely upon the Corporation,
any of its Affiliates or any of their respective employees, officers or directors.
3.5 Cooperation. Upon the termination of your employment for any reason or no reason,
including but not limited to resignation of employment, you will fully cooperate with the Corporation and
its Affiliates upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times, in the prosecution and defense of
complaints, investigations, litigation, arbitration and mediation of any complaints, claims or actions now
7
in existence or that may be threatened or brought in the future relating to events or occurrences that
transpired while employed by the Corporation or any Affiliate.
3.6 Governmental Authorities. Nothing in the Award Agreement prohibits or interferes with
your right to disclose any relevant and necessary information in any action or proceeding relating to the
Award Agreement or as otherwise required by law or legal process. In addition, nothing in the Award
Agreement prohibits or interferes with your or your attorney’s right: (a) to initiate communications
directly with or report or disclose possible violations of law or regulation to, any governmental agency or
entity, legislative body, or any self-regulatory organization, including but not limited to the U.S.
Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the U.S.
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission (“EEOC”), or U.S. Congress, and such reports or disclosures do not require prior notice to,
or authorization from, the Corporation; (b) to participate, cooperate, or testify in any action, investigation
or proceeding with, provide information to, or respond to any inquiry from any governmental agency or
legislative body, any self-regulatory organization, including but not limited to the IRS, SEC, FINRA, the
EEOC, DOJ, U.S. Congress (“Governmental Authorities”), or the Corporation’s Legal or Compliance
Departments and such communications do not require prior notice to, or authorization from the
Corporation. However, with respect to such communications, reports, participation, cooperation or
testimony to the Governmental Authorities, as set forth above in clauses (a) and (b) of this Section, you
may not disclose privileged communications with the Corporation’s counsel. To the extent permitted by
law, upon receipt of a subpoena, court order or other legal process compelling the disclosure of any
information, you will give prompt written notice to the Corporation so as to provide the Corporation
ample opportunity to protect its interests in confidentiality to the fullest extent possible unless the
subpoena, court order or other legal process pertains to an action described above in clauses (a) or (b) of
this Section, in which event no such notice is required. Notwithstanding any confidentiality and nondisclosure obligations you may have, you are hereby advised as follows pursuant to the U.S. Federal
Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016: “An individual shall not be held criminally or civilly liable under any
Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that (A) is made (i) in confidence to a
Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and (ii) solely
for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or
other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. An individual
who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose
the trade secret to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court
proceeding, if the individual (A) files any document containing the trade secret under seal; and (B) does
not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.”
3.7 Periodic Certification of Compliance. In connection with your separation from
employment with the Corporation or its Affiliates, upon request by your Employer, you agree to
periodically certify your compliance with the covenants set forth in this Section 3 through the end of the
Restricted Period. If you fail to provide any such certification(s) as requested by your Employer, the
RSUs whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including any dividend equivalent rights, shall be
immediately forfeited.
3.8 Existing Obligations. The terms of the Award Agreement shall not in any way (a) limit
your obligations pursuant to any other agreements with the Corporation or any of its Affiliates or other
corporate plans or policies applicable to you; or (b) limit the Corporation’s or your Employer’s rights to
exercise any remedies it may have under Applicable Laws or under the terms of such other agreements,
plans or policies.
8
3.9 Failure to Comply with Covenants. If you fail to comply with any of the foregoing
applicable covenants, the RSUs, whether vested (but unsettled) or unvested, and including any dividend
equivalent rights, shall be immediately forfeited and may be subject to repayment as provided in Section
5.4 of these Terms and Conditions. The Corporation and any Affiliate that employs or employed you on
the applicable date has the right to enforce Section 3 of these Terms and Conditions.
SECTION 4: Settlement
 4.1 Time of Settlement.
(a) Time of Settlement. Vested RSUs shall be settled as soon as administratively practicable
following the applicable Vesting Date as reflected in the Award Notice or Section 2.2(a); provided, if you
are a “specified employee” under Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the “Code”), upon separation from service and if such settlement is deferred compensation conditioned
upon a separation from service and not compensation you could receive without separating from service,
then settlement shall not be made until the first day following the six (6) month anniversary of your
separation from service (or upon your death, if earlier).
(b) Acceleration Due to Conflicts of Interest or Ethics Laws (Governmental Service).
Notwithstanding Section 4.1(a), the Corporation may accelerate the vesting and settlement of all or part of
your outstanding RSUs if each of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) you cease to be continuously
employed with your Employer by reason of an event described in Section 2.2(b), (c), (d), or (e); (ii)
pursuant to such section, you continue to vest in your RSUs following your Termination Date; (iii)
following your Termination Date, you become employed by a Governmental Employer; and (iv) you
present the Corporation with satisfactory evidence demonstrating that as a result of such employment with
a Governmental Employer, the divestiture of your RSUs is reasonably necessary to avoid the violation of
United States federal, state or local conflicts of interest or ethics law applicable to you; provided that, no
accelerated distribution shall occur pursuant to this Section 4.1(b) unless the Corporation determines that
such acceleration is consistent with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(iii)(B). In the event that
vesting and settlement of the RSUs are accelerated pursuant to this Section 4.1(b), you shall remain
subject to these Terms and Conditions as if the RSUs had remained outstanding through the original
Vesting Dates and had been settled in accordance with Section 4.1(a), including, but not limited to, for
purposes of (A) determining the duration of the Restricted Period set forth in Section 3.2 (so that the
Restricted Period shall be determined based on the originally scheduled Vesting Dates without regard to
any acceleration) and (B) determining whether the RSUs have been settled for purposes of Section 3.9
(so that the RSUs shall not be deemed to have been vested or settled until the date on which they would
have been vested or settled (as applicable) without regard to acceleration under this Section 4.1(b)). In
the event that the settlement of the RSUs is accelerated in accordance with this Section 4.1(b), upon such
settlement, you shall cease to have any further rights with respect to your RSUs, and for the avoidance of
doubt, any RSUs which are not settled shall be deemed immediately forfeited. As a condition for
acceleration pursuant to this Section 4.1(b), the Corporation may require that you sign an agreement
satisfactory to the Corporation addressing the circumstances of such acceleration and acknowledging
these Terms and Conditions. For purposes of this Section 4.1(b), “Governmental Employer” means a
United States federal, state or local governmental agency, branch, department, or entity and any court or
other tribunal.
 4.2 Form of Settlement. Vested RSUs shall be settled in the form of Common Stock
delivered in book-entry form, except as determined by the Committee as provided in Section 2.2(e).
9
Notwithstanding the foregoing, and except as determined by the Committee as provided in Section 2.2(e),
the Corporation may, in its sole discretion, (a) settle any vested RSUs in the form of a cash payment, or
(b) settle any vested RSUs in the form of Common Stock but require an immediate sale of such shares of
Common Stock (in which case, these Terms and Conditions shall give the Corporation the authority to
issue sales instructions on your behalf). Accrued dividend equivalents corresponding to vested RSUs, if
any, shall be settled in the form of cash, payable without interest, on the next administratively practicable
pay date following the vesting of such RSUs.
SECTION 5: Other Terms and Conditions
 5.1 No Right to Employment. Neither the award of RSUs nor anything else contained in
these Terms and Conditions nor the Plan shall be deemed to limit or restrict the right of your Employer to
terminate your employment at any time, for any reason, with or without Cause.
 5.2 Compliance with Laws. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms and
Conditions, you agree to take any action, and consent to the taking of any action by the Corporation and
your Employer with respect to the RSUs awarded hereunder necessary to achieve compliance with
applicable laws, regulations or relevant regulatory requirements or interpretations in effect from time to
time (“Applicable Laws”). Any determination by the Corporation in this regard shall be final, binding
and conclusive. The Corporation shall in no event be obligated to register any securities pursuant to the
U.S. Securities Act of 1933 (as the same shall be in effect from time to time) or other applicable foreign
securities laws, or to take any other affirmative action in order to cause the delivery of shares in bookentry form or otherwise therefore to comply with any Applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, you
understand and agree that if any payment or other obligation under or arising from these Terms and
Conditions, including without limitation dividend equivalent rights, or the Plan is in conflict with or is
restricted by any Applicable Laws, the Corporation may reduce, revoke, cancel, clawback or impose
different terms and conditions to the extent it deems necessary or appropriate, in its sole discretion, to
effect such compliance. If the Corporation determines that it is necessary or appropriate for any payments
under these Terms and Conditions to be delayed in order to avoid additional tax, interest and or penalties
under Section 409A of the Code, then the payments would not be made before the date which is the first
day following the six (6) month anniversary of the date of your termination of employment (or upon
earlier death).
5.3 Tax Withholding. Regardless of any action the Corporation or your Employer take with
respect to any or all income tax (including U.S. federal, state and local taxes or non-U.S. taxes), social
insurance, payroll tax, payment on account or other tax-related withholding (“Tax-Related Items”), you
acknowledge that the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items legally due by you is and remains your
responsibility and that the Corporation and your Employer (a) make no representations or undertakings
regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the RSUs, including
the grant of the RSUs, the vesting of the RSUs, the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock
acquired pursuant to the RSUs and the receipt of any dividends or dividend equivalents, and (b) do not
commit to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the RSUs to reduce or eliminate your liability
for Tax-Related Items. Further, if you are or become subject to taxation in more than one country, you
acknowledge that the Corporation and/or your Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be
required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one country.
Prior to the delivery of shares of Common Stock upon the vesting of your RSUs, if your country of
residence (and/or the country of employment, if different) requires withholding or payment of Tax10
Related Items, the Corporation shall be authorized to withhold a sufficient number of whole shares of
Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the vesting of the RSUs that have an aggregate Fair Market
Value sufficient to pay the Tax-Related Items required to be withheld with respect to the shares of
Common Stock. The cash equivalent of the shares of Common Stock withheld will be used to settle the
obligation to withhold the Tax-Related Items. In the event that withholding in shares of Common Stock
is prohibited or problematic under Applicable Laws or otherwise may trigger adverse consequences to the
Corporation or your Employer, your Employer is authorized to withhold the Tax-Related Items required
to be withheld with respect to the shares of Common Stock in cash from your regular salary and/or wages
or any other amounts payable to you. In the event the withholding requirements are not satisfied through
the withholding of shares of Common Stock by the Corporation or through your regular salary and/or
wages or other amounts payable to you by your Employer, no shares of Common Stock will be issued to
you (or your estate) upon vesting of the RSUs unless and until satisfactory arrangements have been made
by you with respect to the payment of any Tax-Related Items that the Corporation or your Employer
determines, in its sole discretion, must be withheld or collected with respect to such RSUs. By accepting
this grant of RSUs, you expressly consent to the withholding of shares of Common Stock and/or
withholding from your regular salary and/or wages or other amounts payable to you as provided for
hereunder. All other Tax-Related Items related to the RSUs and any shares of Common Stock delivered
in payment thereof are your sole responsibility. Without limiting the Corporation’s or your Employer’s
authority to satisfy their withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items as set forth herein, by accepting
this grant of RSUs, you authorize the Corporation and/or your Employer to withhold shares of Common
Stock otherwise deliverable to you upon vesting of your RSUs to satisfy Tax-Related Items, regardless of
whether the Corporation and/or your Employer have an obligation to withhold such Tax-Related Items.
The Corporation or your Employer may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering
applicable statutory or other withholding rates, including minimum or maximum rates applicable in your
jurisdiction(s). In the event of over-withholding, you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount
in cash (with no entitlement to the equivalent in Common Stock). In the event of under-withholding, you
may be required to pay any additional Tax-Related Items directly to the applicable tax authority or to the
Corporation and/or your Employer. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in
shares of Common Stock, you shall be deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Common
Stock subject to the vested RSUs, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Common Stock are held
back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
 [5.4 Forfeiture and Repayment. If, directly or indirectly:
 (a) during the course of your employment with your Employer, you violate any obligations
set forth in the Award Agreement (including without limitation those obligations set forth in Section 3 of
these Terms and Conditions) or engage in conduct or it is discovered that you engaged in conduct that is
adverse to the interests of the Corporation or its Affiliates, including but not limited to failures to comply
with the Corporation’s or any of its Affiliate’s rules or regulations, fraud, or conduct contributing to any
financial restatements or irregularities;
(b) during the course of your employment with your Employer, you engage (other than for
the benefit of the Corporation or its Affiliates) in solicitation and/or diversion of customers or employees;
(c) during the course of your employment with your Employer, you engage in competition
with the Corporation or its Affiliates;
11
(d) following termination of your employment with your Employer for any reason, with or
without Cause, you violate any post-termination obligations or duties owed to the Corporation or its
Affiliates under any agreement with the Corporation or its Affiliates, including without limitation, any
employment, confidentiality, non-solicitation, non-competition or other agreement restricting postemployment conduct (including without limitation those obligations set forth in Section 3 of these Terms
and Conditions); or
(e) any compensation that the Corporation or its Affiliates has promised or paid to you is
required to be forfeited and/or repaid to the Corporation or its Affiliates pursuant to applicable regulatory
requirements;
then the Corporation may cancel all or any portion of the RSUs and/or require repayment of any sums
(including, in the case of shares of Common Stock, the value of those shares of Common Stock) or other
amounts which were acquired pursuant to the RSUs (including without limitation any dividends paid on
the shares of Common Stock and dividend equivalents). The Corporation shall have sole discretion to
determine what constitutes grounds for forfeiture and/or repayment under this Section 5.4, and, in such
event, the portion of the RSUs that shall be cancelled and the sums or amounts that shall be repaid. For
purposes of the foregoing, you expressly and explicitly authorize the Corporation to issue instructions, on
your behalf, to any brokerage firm and/or third party administrator engaged by the Corporation to hold the
shares of Common Stock and other amounts acquired pursuant to the RSUs to re-convey, transfer or
otherwise return such shares and/or other amounts to the Corporation.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Corporation will also cancel all or any portion of the RSUs and/or require
repayment of any shares of Common Stock (or the value thereof) and other amounts which were acquired
pursuant to the RSUs (including without limitation any dividends paid on the shares of Common Stock
and dividend equivalents) as required by Applicable Laws and/or the Corporation’s Policy for the
Recovery of Erroneously Awarded Incentive-Based Compensation (the “Recovery Policy”), if
applicable. To the extent that you are subject to the Recovery Policy, you agree that, notwithstanding the
terms of any indemnification arrangement or insurance policy, the Corporation shall not indemnify you
against the loss of erroneously awarded Incentive-Based Compensation (as defined in the Recovery
Policy), including any payment or reimbursement for the cost of insurance obtained by you to fund
amounts recoverable under the Recovery Policy. In order to satisfy any recoupment obligation arising
under any clawback or recovery policy of the Corporation or otherwise under Applicable Laws, you
expressly and explicitly authorize the Corporation to issue instructions, on your behalf, to any brokerage
firm or stock plan service provider engaged by the Corporation to hold any shares of Common Stock or
other amounts acquired pursuant to the RSUs to re-convey, transfer or otherwise return the shares of
Common Stock and/or other amounts to the Corporation upon the Corporation’s enforcement of any
clawback or recovery policy or Applicable Laws.]
 5.5 Governing Law and Choice of Forum. The Award Agreement shall be construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, other than any choice of law provisions
calling for the application of laws of another jurisdiction. For purposes of litigating any dispute that
arises directly or indirectly from the relationship of the parties evidenced by this grant or the Award
Agreement, the parties hereby submit to and consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of New
York and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of New York County, New York,
or the federal courts for the United States for the Southern District of New York, and no other courts,
where this grant is made and/or to be performed and agree to such other choice of forum provisions as are
included in the Plan.
12
5.6 Nature of Plan. By participating in the Plan, you acknowledge, understand and agree
that:
(a) The Plan is discretionary in nature and limited in duration, and may be amended,
cancelled, or terminated by the Corporation, in its sole discretion, at any time.
(b) The grant of RSUs under the Plan is a one-time benefit and does not create any
contractual or other right to receive RSUs or benefits in lieu of such awards in the future. Future awards,
if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Corporation, including, but not limited to, the form and timing
of the award, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the award, the vesting provisions
applicable to the award and the purchase price (if any).
(c) Your participation in the Plan is voluntary, and the value of your RSUs is an
extraordinary item of compensation and is outside the scope of your employment (and your employment
contract, if any). As such, your RSUs are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of
calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, dismissal, termination or end of service payments,
bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement benefits, or similar payments.
(d) No claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the
RSUs or recoupment of any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan resulting from (i) the
termination of your employment or other service relationship (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not
later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or
the terms of your employment agreement, if any) and/or (ii) the application of any recoupment policy or
any recovery or clawback policy otherwise required by law. In consideration of the grant of the RSUs,
you expressly agree not to institute any such claim against the Corporation, any of its Affiliates or
your Employer.
 5.7 Data Privacy. By accepting the RSUs, you declare that you agree with the data
processing practices described herein and consent to the collection, processing and use of your
Personal Data (as defined below) by the Corporation and the transfer of your Personal Data to the
recipients mentioned herein, including recipients located in countries which do not adduce an
adequate level of protection from a European (or other non-U.S.) data protection law perspective, for
the purposes described herein.
(a) Declaration of Consent. You understand that you need to review the following
information about the processing of your personal data by or on behalf of the Corporation, your
Employer and/or any of its Affiliates, as described herein, and any other RSU grant materials (the
“Personal Data”) and declare your consent. With regard to the processing of your Personal Data in
connection with the Plan, you understand that the Corporation is the controller of the Personal Data.
(b) Data Processing and Legal Basis. The Corporation collects, uses and otherwise
processes your Personal Data for the purposes of allocating shares and implementing, administering
and managing the Plan. You understand that this Personal Data may include, without limitation, your
name, home address and telephone number, email address, personal bank account details, date of
birth, social insurance number, passport number or other identification number (e.g., resident
registration number), salary, nationality, job title, any shares of Common Stock or directorships held in
the Corporation or its Affiliates, details of all RSUs or any other entitlement to shares of Common
Stock or equivalent benefits awarded, canceled, purchased, vested, unvested or outstanding in your
favor. The Corporation’s legal basis for the processing of your Personal Data is your consent.
13
(c) Stock Plan Administration Service Providers. You understand that the Corporation
may transfer your Personal Data, or parts thereof, to Fidelity Stock Plan Services LLC and certain of
its affiliated companies (“Fidelity”), an independent service provider based in the United States which
assists the Corporation with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan. In the
future, the Corporation may select a different service provider and share your Personal Data with such
different service provider that serves the Corporation in a similar manner. You understand and
acknowledge that the Corporation’s service provider may open an account for you to receive and trade
shares acquired under the Plan and that you will be asked to agree on separate terms and data
processing practices with the service provider, which is a condition of your ability to participate in the
Plan.
(d) International Data Transfers. You understand that the Corporation and, as of the date
hereof, certain third parties assisting in the implementation, administration and management of the
Plan, such as the Corporation’s service providers, are based in the United States. If you are located
outside the United States, you understand and acknowledge that your country has enacted data privacy
laws that are different from the laws of the United States. Transfers of personal data from the EU to
the United States can be made on the basis of Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European
Commission or other appropriate safeguards permissible under the Applicable Laws. If you are
located in the EU or EEA, the Corporation may receive, process and transfer your Personal Data
onward to third-party service providers solely on the basis of appropriate data transfer agreements or
other appropriate safeguards permissible under Applicable Laws. If applicable, you understand that
you can ask for a copy of the appropriate data processing agreements underlying the transfer of your
Personal Data by contacting your local People Team representative. The Corporation’s legal basis for
the transfer of your Personal Data is your consent.
(e) Data Retention. You understand that the Corporation will use your Personal Data only
as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan, or to
comply with Applicable Laws, including under tax and securities laws. In the latter case, you
understand and acknowledge that the Corporation’s legal basis for the processing of your Personal
Data would be compliance with the Applicable Laws or the pursuit by the Corporation of respective
legitimate interests not outweighed by your interests, rights or freedoms. When the Corporation no
longer needs your Personal Data for any of the above purposes, you understand the Corporation will
remove it from its systems.
(f) Voluntariness and Consequences of Denial/Withdrawal of Consent. You understand
that your participation in the Plan and your grant of consent is purely voluntary. You may deny or
later withdraw your consent at any time, with future effect and for any or no reason. If you deny or
later withdraw your consent, the Corporation can no longer offer you participation in the Plan or offer
other awards to you or administer or maintain such awards and you would no longer be able to
participate in the Plan. You further understand that denial or withdrawal of your consent would not
affect your status or salary as an employee or your career and that you would merely forfeit the
opportunities associated with the Plan.
(g) Data Subject Rights. You understand that data subject rights regarding the processing
of personal data vary depending on the Applicable Laws and that, depending on where you are based
and subject to the conditions set out in the Applicable Laws, you may have, without limitation, the
rights to (i) inquire whether and what kind of Personal Data the Corporation holds about you and how
it is processed, and to access or request copies of such Personal Data, (ii) request the correction or
supplementation of Personal Data about you that is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date in light of
14
the purposes underlying the processing, (iii) obtain the erasure of Personal Data no longer necessary
for the purposes underlying the processing, processed based on withdrawn consent, processed for
legitimate interests that, in the context of your objection, do not prove to be compelling, or processed in
non-compliance with applicable legal requirements, (iv) request the Corporation to restrict the
processing of your Personal Data in certain situations where you feel its processing is inappropriate,
(v) object, in certain circumstances, to the processing of Personal Data for legitimate interests, and to
(vi) request portability of your Personal Data that you have actively or passively provided to the
Corporation (which does not include data derived or inferred from the collected data), where the
processing of such Personal Data is based on consent or your employment or service contract and is
carried out by automated means. In case of concerns, you understand that you may also have the right
to lodge a complaint with the competent local data protection authority. Further, to receive
clarification of, or to exercise any of your rights, you should contact your local People Team
representative.
5.8 Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws. You may be subject to insider trading restrictions
and/or market abuse laws based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in
applicable jurisdictions including the United States and your country or your broker’s country, if
different, which may affect your ability to accept, acquire, sell or otherwise dispose of shares of Common
Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., RSUs) or rights linked to the value of shares of Common
Stock under the Plan during such times as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the
Corporation (as defined by the laws in the applicable jurisdictions). Local insider trading laws and
regulations may prohibit the cancellation or amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside
information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (a) disclosing the inside information to any third
party and (b) “tipping” third parties or causing them otherwise to buy or sell securities (third parties
include fellow employees). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in
addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable insider trading policy of the
Corporation. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions,
and you should speak to your personal advisor on this matter.
5.9 Electronic Delivery and Acceptance. The Corporation may, in its sole discretion, deliver
any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby
consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an
on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Corporation or a third party designated by
the Corporation.
5.10 Severability. The provisions of these Terms and Conditions are severable and if any one

requiring you to sign any agreements or undertakings that may be necessary to accomplish the foregoing.

Summary of financial highlights
We reported net income applicable to common
shareholders of $4.3 billion, or $5.80 per diluted
common share, in 2024, including the negative
impact of notable items. Notable items in 2024
include severance expense, litigation reserves and the
net impact of adjustments for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment.
Excluding notable items, net income applicable to
common shareholders was $4.5 billion (Non-GAAP),
or $6.03 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in
2024. In 2023, net income applicable to common
shareholders was $3.1 billion, or $3.89 per diluted

common share, including the negative impact of
notable items. Notable items in 2023 include the
initial estimate for the FDIC special assessment,
severance expense, the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable, litigation
reserves and net losses on disposals. Excluding
notable items, net income applicable to common
shareholders was $4.0 billion (Non-GAAP), or $5.07
(Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in 2023.
The highlights below are based on 2024 compared
with 2023, unless otherwise noted.
• Total revenue increased 5%, primarily reflecting:
• Fee revenue increased 6%, primarily
reflecting higher market values, net new
business, higher client activity and foreign
exchange revenue, partially offset by the mix
of AUM flows. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 5.)
• Investment and other revenue increased
primarily reflecting the reduction in the fair
value of a contingent consideration receivable
in 2023 and higher client activity in our fixed
income and equity trading business. (See
“Fee and other revenue” beginning on page
5.)
• Net interest income decreased 1%, primarily
reflecting changes in deposit mix, partially
offset by higher investment securities
portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.
(See “Net interest income” beginning on page
8.)
• The provision for credit losses was $70 million,
primarily driven by reserve increases related to
commercial real estate exposure and changes in
the macroeconomic forecast. (See “Consolidated
balance sheet review – Allowance for credit
losses” beginning on page 33.)
• Noninterest expense decreased 4%, primarily
reflecting the net impact of adjustments for the
FDIC special assessment and efficiency savings,
partially offset by higher investments, employee
merit increases and revenue-related expenses.
Excluding notable items, noninterest expense
increased 1% (Non-GAAP). (See “Noninterest
expense” on page 11.)
• Effective tax rate of 22.3% in 2024. (See
“Income taxes” on page 11.)
• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 11.9%
for 2024. Excluding notable items, the adjusted
ROE was 12.4% (Non-GAAP) for 2024.
• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”)
was 22.8% (Non-GAAP) for 2024. Excluding
notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was 23.8%
(Non-GAAP) for 2024.
See “Supplemental Information – Explanation of
GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures”
beginning on page 115 for reconciliations of the NonGAAP measures.
Metrics
• AUC/A totaled $52.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024
compared with $47.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The 9% increase primarily reflects higher market
values, client inflows and net new business,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 5.)
• AUM totaled $2.03 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024
compared with $1.97 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The 3% increase primarily reflects higher market
values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar. (See “Review of
business segments – Investment and Wealth
Management business segment” beginning on
page 17.)
Capital and liquidity
• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 11.5%
at Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced
Approaches. The decrease was primarily driven
by capital returned through common stock
repurchases and dividends and higher riskweighted assets (“RWAs”), partially offset by
capital generated through earnings. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 39.)
• Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at Dec. 31,
2024, compared with 6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023. The
decrease was driven by higher average assets,
partially offset by an increase in capital. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 39.)

primarily reflecting higher investment services fees,
investment management and performance fees and
foreign exchange revenue.
Investment and other revenue increased $207 million
in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily reflecting the
reduction in the fair value of a contingent
consideration receivable in 2023 and higher client
activity in our fixed income and equity trading
business.

2023, primarily reflecting higher market values, net
new business and higher client activity.
AUC/A totaled $52.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024, an
increase of 9% compared with Dec. 31, 2023,
primarily reflecting higher market values, client

securities and 65% fixed-income securities at Dec.

See “Securities Services business segment” and
“Market and Wealth Services business segment” in
“Review of business segments” for additional details.
Investment management and performance fees
Investment management and performance fees
increased 3% compared with 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the
mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees.
Performance fees were $51 million in 2024 and $81
million in 2023. On a constant currency basis (NonGAAP), investment management and performance
fees increased 2% compared with 2023. See
“Supplemental Information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on
page 115 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP
measures.
AUM was $2.0 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024, an increase
of 3% compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for
additional details regarding the drivers of investment
management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.
Results of Operations (continued)
BNY 5
Foreign exchange revenue
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by
market volatility, the impact of foreign currency
hedging activities and foreign currency
remeasurement gain (loss). In 2024, foreign
exchange revenue increased 9% compared with 2023,
primarily reflecting higher volumes. Foreign
exchange revenue is primarily reported in the
Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser
extent, the Market and Wealth Services and
Investment and Wealth Management business
segments and the Other segment.
Financing-related fees
Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported
in the Market and Wealth Services and Securities
Services business segments, include capital market
fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.
Financing-related fees increased 13% in 2024
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher
underwriting fees.
Distribution and servicing fees
Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual
funds are primarily based on average assets in the
funds and the sales of funds that we manage or
administer, and are primarily reported in the
Investment Management line of business. These fees,
which include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall
level of net sales, the relative mix of sales between
share classes, the funds’ market values and money
market fee waivers.
Distribution and servicing fees were $158 million in
2024 compared with $148 million in 2023, driven by
higher money market balances. The impact of
distribution and servicing fees on income in any one
period is partially offset by distribution and servicing
expense paid to other financial intermediaries to
cover their costs for distribution and servicing of
mutual funds. Distribution and servicing expense is
recorded as noninterest expense on the income
statement.
Investment and other revenue
Investment and other revenue includes income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds,
seed capital gains or losses, other trading revenue or
loss, renewable energy investments gains or losses,
income from corporate and bank-owned life
insurance contracts, other investment gains or losses,
gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture,
other income or loss and net securities gains or losses.
The income or loss from consolidated investment
management funds should be considered together
with the net income or loss attributable to
noncontrolling interests, which reflects the portion of
the consolidated funds for which we do not have an
economic interest and is reflected below net income
as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily
includes the impact of market-risk hedging activity
related to our seed capital investments in investment

(b) Results for the years ended Dec. 31, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2022 were restated to reflect the retrospective application of adopting new
accounting guidance in 2024 related to our investments in renewable energy projects using the proportional amortization method (ASU
2023-02). See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(c) Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments.
(d) Includes a net loss of $449 million related to the repositioning of the securities portfolio.
Investment and other revenue was $687 million in
2024 compared with $480 million in 2023. The
increase primarily reflects the reduction in the fair
value of a contingent consideration receivable in 2023
and higher client activity in our fixed income and
equity trading business.

industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.
Net interest income decreased 1% compared with
2023, primarily reflecting changes in deposit mix,
partially offset by higher investment securities
portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.
Net interest margin decreased 3 basis points
compared with 2023. The decrease primarily reflects
the factors mentioned above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 2%
compared with 2023. The increase primarily reflects
higher federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements, loan balances and securities,
partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and
interest-bearing deposits with banks.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised
approximately 25% of our average total deposits in
2024 and 2023. Approximately 50% of the average
non-U.S. dollar deposits in 2024 and 45% in 2023
were euro-denominated.
Net interest income in 2025 will largely depend on
the level and mix of client deposits and investment
securities portfolio reinvestment yields. Based on
market implied forward interest rates as of Dec. 31,
2024, we expect net interest income for 2025 to
increase when compared with 2024.

Total noninterest expense decreased 4% compared

investments, employee merit increases and revenuerelated expenses. Excluding notable items,
noninterest expense increased 1% (Non-GAAP). See
“Supervision and Regulation – FDIC Deposit

the FDIC special assessment. See “Supplemental

We expect total noninterest expense for 2025 to

revenue-related expenses, partially offset by the
benefit of efficiency savings.

Review of business segments
We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our three principal business segments: Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management, and the Other segment.
Business segment accounting principles
Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than
the generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that
reported results of the businesses will track their
economic performance.
Our business segments are consistent with the
structure used by the President and Chief Executive
Officer, our Chief Operating Decision Maker
(“CODM”), to make key operating decisions and
assess performance. Our CODM evaluates the
business segments’ operating performance primarily
based on fee and other revenue, total revenue, income
before income taxes, and pre-tax operating margin.
The significant expense information regularly
Results of Operations (continued)
BNY 11
provided to and reviewed by the CODM is total
noninterest expense. The CODM considers this
information when evaluating the performance of each
business segment and making decisions about
allocating capital and other resources to each business
segment.
For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, the primary products and services
in each line of business, the primary types of revenue
by line of business and how our business segments
are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business segment results are subject to
reclassification when organizational changes are
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. In 2024, we made
certain realignments of similar products and services
within our lines of business consistent with the firm’s
ongoing transition to a platforms operating model
uniting related capabilities and enabling streamlining
of internal processes to drive growth, efficiency,
resiliency, and enhanced risk management. The
largest change was the movement of Institutional
Solutions from Pershing to Clearance and Collateral
Management, both in the Market and Wealth Services
business segment. We made other smaller changes
that moved activity from Asset Servicing in the
Securities Services business segment to Treasury
Services in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment, and from Wealth Management in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment and Pershing in the Market and Wealth
Services business segment to Investment
Management in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment. The Other segment
was not impacted by the changes. Business segment
results for 2023 and 2022 have been revised to reflect
these changes.
The results of our business segments may be
influenced by client and other activities that vary by
quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense typically
increases, reflecting the vesting of long-term stock
awards for retirement-eligible employees. The timing
of our annual employee merit increases also impacts
staff expense. In 2024, the merit increase was
effective in March and in 2023, the merit increase
was effective in April, thus partially impacting the
full-year staff expense variances. In the third quarter,
volume-related fees may decline due to reduced client
activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically incur
higher business development and marketing
expenses. In our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, performance fees are
typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as
those quarters represent the end of the measurement
period for many of the performance fee-eligible
relationships.
The results of our business segments may also be
impacted by the translation of financial results
denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
We are primarily impacted by activities denominated
in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Securities Services and Market and
Wealth Services business segments, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than
revenues. However, our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment typically has more
foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment more than the
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments. However, currency fluctuations,
in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on a consolidated basis.
Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, and to a lesser extent,
the Securities Services and Market and Wealth
Services business segments, is impacted by global
market fluctuations. At Dec. 31, 2024, we estimated
that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread
evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue
by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common
share by $0.05 to $0.08.
See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules which
show the contribution of our business segments to our
overall profitability.

Business segment description
The Securities Services business segment consists of
two distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and
Issuer Services, which provide business solutions
across the transaction lifecycle to our global asset
owner and asset manager clients. We are one of the
leading global investment services providers with
$37.7 trillion of AUC/A at Dec. 31, 2024. For
information on the drivers of the Securities Services
fee revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The Asset Servicing business provides a
comprehensive suite of solutions. We are one of the
largest global custody, fund administrator and frontto-back outsourcing partners. We offer services for
the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally
as well as fund accounting services, exchange-traded
funds servicing, transfer agency, trust and depository,
front-to-back capabilities and data and analytics
solutions for our clients. We deliver foreign
exchange, and securities lending and financing
solutions, on both an agency and principal basis. Our
agency securities lending program is one of the
largest lenders of U.S. and non-U.S. securities,
servicing a lendable asset pool of approximately $5.4
trillion in 34 separate markets. Our market-leading
liquidity services portal enables cash investments for
institutional clients and includes fund research and
analytics.
Our Digital Asset Custody platform offers custody
and administration services for Bitcoin and Ether for
select U.S. institutional clients. Our Digital Assets
Funds Services provides accounting and
administration, transfer agency and ETF services to
digital asset funds. We continue to develop our
digital asset capabilities working closely with clients
to address their evolving digital asset needs. As of
and for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, our Digital
Asset Custody platform and related initiatives had a
de minimis impact on our assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses.
The Issuer Services business includes Corporate
Trust and Depositary Receipts. Our Corporate
Trust business delivers a full range of issuer and
related investor services, including trustee, paying
agency, fiduciary, escrow and other financial
services. We are a leading provider to the debt

Review of financial results
AUC/A of $37.7 trillion increased 10% compared
with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values, client inflows and net new business,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar.
Total revenue of $8.9 billion increased 4% compared
with 2023. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $6.9 billion increased 4%
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values, net new business, higher client
activity, including in our fixed income and trading
business, and higher foreign exchange revenue,
partially offset by lower net interest income.
Issuer Services revenue of $2.0 billion increased 3%
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting Corporate
Trust fees driven by net new business, partially offset
by lower Depositary Receipts revenue.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are
also negatively impacting our investment services
fees. However, at the same time, these trends are
providing additional outsourcing opportunities as
clients and other market participants seek to comply
with regulations and reduce their operating costs.
Noninterest expense of $6.3 billion decreased 1%
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting efficiency
savings, partially offset by higher investments and
employee merit increases.

Total revenue of $6.3 billion increased 7% compared
with 2023. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.
Pershing revenue of $2.7 billion increased 3%
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values and client activity, partially offset by
lost business in the prior year and lower net interest
income. Net new assets of $(6) billion in 2024
reflects the deconversion of business lost in the prior
year.
Treasury Services revenue of $1.7 billion increased
6% compared with 2023, primarily reflecting net new
business, higher client activity and higher net interest
income.
Clearance and Collateral Management revenue of
$1.8 billion increased 14% compared with 2023,
primarily reflecting higher collateral management
fees, clearance volumes and net interest income.

Business segment description
Our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment consists of two distinct lines of business,
Investment Management and Wealth Management,
which have a combined AUM of $2.0 trillion as of
Dec. 31, 2024.
Investment Management is a leading global asset
manager and consists of seven specialist investment
firms and a global distribution platform to deliver a
diversified range of investment capabilities to
institutional and retail clients globally.
Our Investment Management model provides
specialist expertise from seven investment firms
offering solutions across major asset classes, backed
by the strength, scale and proven stewardship of
BNY. Each investment firm has its own individual
culture, investment philosophy and proprietary
investment process. This approach brings our clients
clear, independent thinking from highly experienced
investment professionals.
The investment firms offer a broad range of actively
managed equity, fixed income, multi-asset and
liability-driven investments, along with passive
products and cash management. Our six majorityowned investment firms are: ARX, Dreyfus, Insight
Investment, Mellon, Newton Investment Management
and Walter Scott. BNY owns a noncontrolling
interest in Siguler Guff.
Investment Management has multiple global
distribution entities, which are responsible for
distributing the investment solutions developed and
managed by the investment firms, as well as the
management and distribution of our U.S. mutual
funds, ETFs and certain offshore money market
funds.
Wealth Management provides investment
management, custody, wealth and estate planning,
private banking services, investment servicing and
information management. Wealth Management has
$327 billion in client assets as of Dec. 31, 2024, and
more than 30 offices in the U.S. and internationally.
Wealth Management clients include individuals,
families and institutions. Institutions include family
offices, charitable gift programs and endowments and
foundations. We work with clients to build, manage
and sustain wealth across generations and market
cycles.
The wealth business differentiates itself with a
comprehensive wealth management framework called
Active Wealth that seeks to empower clients to build
and sustain long-term wealth.
The results of the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment are driven by a blend
of daily, monthly and quarterly AUM by product
type. The overall level of AUM for a given period is
determined by:
• the beginning level of AUM;
Results of Operations (continued)
18 BNY
• the net flows of new assets during the period
resulting from new business wins and existing
client inflows, reduced by the loss of clients and
existing client outflows; and
• the impact of market price appreciation or
depreciation, foreign exchange rates and
investment firm acquisitions or divestitures.
The mix of AUM is a result of the historical growth
rates of equity and fixed income markets and the
cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a
result of client asset allocation decisions. Actively
managed equity, multi-asset and alternative assets
typically generate higher percentage fees than fixedincome and liability-driven investments and cash.
Also, actively managed assets typically generate
higher management fees than indexed or passively
managed assets of the same type. Market and
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand
for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.
Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM and the management
fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one
percent) charged for managing those assets.
Management fees are typically subject to fee
schedules based on the overall level of assets
managed for a single client or by individual asset
class and style. This is most common for institutional
clients where we typically manage substantial assets
for individual accounts.
Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a
benchmark index or a peer group’s performance.
A key driver of growth in investment management
and performance fees is the amount of net new AUM
flows. Overall market conditions are also key
drivers, with a significant long-term economic driver
being growth of global financial assets.
Net interest income is determined by loan and deposit
volumes and the interest rate spread between
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on
loans and deposits. Expenses in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment are mainly
driven by staff and distribution and servicing
expenses.
Review of financial results
AUM of $2.0 trillion increased 3% compared with
Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market
values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar.
Net long-term strategy outflows were $52 billion in
2024, driven by outflows of index, equity and multiasset and alternative investments, partially offset by
inflows of fixed income and liability-driven
investments. Short-term strategy inflows were $45
billion in 2024.
Total revenue of $3.4 billion increased 7% compared
with 2023. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.
Investment Management revenue of $2.3 billion
increased 9% compared with 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values and the reduction in
the fair value of a contingent consideration receivable
in 2023, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows
and lower performance fees.
Wealth Management revenue of $1.1 billion
increased 5% compared with 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by
changes in product mix.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 30% from
non-U.S. sources in 2024, compared with 32% in
2023.
Noninterest expense of $2.8 billion was flat compared
with 2023, primarily reflecting employee merit
increases and higher investments, offset by efficiency
savings.

The Other segment primarily includes:
• the leasing portfolio;
• corporate treasury activities, including our
securities portfolio;
• derivatives and other trading activity;
• corporate and bank-owned life insurance;
• tax credit investments and other corporate
investments; and
• certain business exits.
Revenue primarily reflects:
• net interest income (expense) and lease-related
gains (losses) from leasing operations;
• net interest income (expense) and derivatives and
other corporate treasury activities;
• other revenue from certain business exits;
• investment and other revenue from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance, gains (losses)
associated with investment securities and other
assets; and
• fee revenue from the elimination of the results of
certain services provided between segments,
which are also provided to third parties.
Expenses include:
• direct expenses supporting leasing, investing and
funding activities; and
• expenses not directly attributable to Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and
Investment and Wealth Management operations.
Review of financial results
Loss before taxes was $226 million in 2024 compared
with $867 million in 2023.
Investment and other revenue decreased $44 million
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting investment
gains recorded in 2023 and higher net securities
losses.
Noninterest expense decreased $702 million
compared with 2023, primarily driven by adjustments
for the FDIC special assessment.
International operations
Our primary international activities consist of asset
servicing in our Securities Services business segment,
global payment services in our Market and Wealth
Services business segment and investment
management in our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment.
Our clients include central banks and sovereigns,
financial institutions, asset managers, insurance
companies, corporations, local authorities and highnet-worth individuals and family offices. Through
our global network of offices, we have developed a
deep understanding of local requirements and cultural
needs, and we pride ourselves on providing dedicated
service through our multilingual sales, marketing and
client service teams.
At Dec. 31, 2024, approximately 60% of our total
employees (full-time and part-time employees) were
based outside the U.S., with approximately 10,900
employees in EMEA, approximately 18,900
employees in APAC and approximately 800
employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil.
We are a leading global asset manager. Our
international operations managed 47% of BNY’s
AUM at Dec. 31, 2024 and 51% at Dec. 31, 2023.

In Europe, we maintain capabilities to service
Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities and alternative investment
funds. We offer a full range of tailored solutions for
investment companies, financial institutions and
institutional investors across most European markets.
We are a provider of non-U.S. government securities,
fixed income and equities clearance, settling
securities transactions directly in European markets,
and using a high-quality and established network of
local agents in non-European markets.
We have extensive experience providing trade and
cash services to financial institutions and central
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a
broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to
financial institutions, corporations and central banks.
In emerging markets, we lead with custody, global
payments and issuer services, introducing other
products as the markets mature. For more established
markets, our focus is on global investment services.
We are also a full-service global provider of foreign
exchange services, actively trading in over 100 of the
world’s currencies. We serve clients from trading
desks located in Europe, Asia and North America.
Our financial results, as well as our levels of AUC/A
and AUM, are impacted by translation from foreign
currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British
pound and the euro. If the U.S. dollar depreciates
against these currencies, the translation impact is a
higher level of fee revenue, net interest income,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM.
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the
translated levels of fee revenue, net interest income,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM will be
lower.

International clients accounted for 35% of revenues in
2024 and 36% in 2023. Net income from
international operations was $2.3 billion in 2024,
compared with $2.0 billion in 2023.
Revenues from EMEA were $4.3 billion in 2024, an
increase of 4% compared with 2023. The increase
was primarily driven by higher net interest income,
collateral management fees and clearance volumes in
the Market and Wealth Services business segment.
The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business
segments generated 58%, 24% and 18% of EMEA
revenues, respectively. Net income from EMEA was
$1.3 billion in 2024, compared with $1.1 billion in
2023.
Revenues from APAC were $1.3 billion in 2024, a
decrease of 1% compared with 2023. The decrease
primarily reflects lower revenue in the Market and
Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments, partially offset by
higher revenue in the Securities Services business
segment.
The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business
segments generated 60%, 30% and 10% of APAC
revenues, respectively. Net income from APAC was
$542 million in 2024, compared with $547 million in
2023.

Country risk exposure
The following table presents BNY’s top 10 exposures
by country (excluding the U.S.) as of Dec. 31, 2024,
as well as certain countries with higher-risk profiles.
The exposure is presented on an internal risk
management basis and has not been reduced by the
allowance for credit losses. We monitor our exposure
to these and other countries as part of our internal
country risk management process.
The country risk exposure below reflects the
Company’s risk to an immediate default of the
counterparty or obligor based on the country of
residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If
there is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence
of the entity providing the risk mitigation is the
country of risk. The country of risk for securities is
generally based on the domicile of the issuer of the
security.

Russia. The country risk exposure to Russia consists

insignificant as a percentage of the total AUC/A and
AUM, respectively. We will continue to work with
multinational clients that depend on our custody and
recordkeeping services to manage their exposures.
We are also monitoring our exposure to Israel as part
of our internal country risk management process. At
Dec. 31, 2024, our total exposure to Israel was $158
million and primarily consisted of investment grade
short-term interest-bearing deposits and OTC
derivatives maturing within six months.
Critical accounting estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of these policies include critical
accounting estimates which require management to
make subjective or complex judgments about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and
may change in subsequent periods. Our critical
accounting estimates are those related to the

allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other
intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting
estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee.
Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses covers financial assets
subject to credit losses and measured at amortized
cost, including loans and lending-related
commitments, held-to-maturity securities, certain
securities financing transactions and deposits with
banks. The allowance for credit losses is intended to
adjust the carrying value of these assets by an
estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to
incur over the life of the asset. Similarly, the
allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments and other off-balance sheet financial
instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that
we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the
balance sheet date.
A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses.
The quantitative component of our estimate uses
models and methodologies that categorize financial
assets based on product type, collateral type, and
other credit trends and risk characteristics, including
relevant information about past events, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions that affect the
collectability of the recorded amounts. For the
quantitative component, we segment portfolios into
various major components including commercial
loans and lease financing, commercial real estate,
financial institutions, residential mortgages, and
other. The segmentation of our debt securities
portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by
whether the security is structured or non-structured
(i.e., direct obligation), as well as the issuer type. The
components of the credit loss calculation for each
major portfolio or asset class include a probability of
default, loss given default and exposure at default, as
applicable, and their values depend on the forecast
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment. We utilize a multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting
of three scenarios: a baseline and upside and
downside scenarios and allows us to develop our
estimate using a wide span of economic variables.
Our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely
performance of each global region and the other two
scenarios are designed relative to the baseline
scenario. This approach incorporates a reasonable
and supportable forecast period spanning the life of
the asset, and includes both an initial estimated
economic outlook component as well as a reversion
component for each economic input variable. The
length of each of the two components depends on the
underlying financial instrument, scenario, and
underlying economic input variable. In general, the
initial economic outlook period for each economic
input variable under each scenario ranges between
several months and two years. The speed at which
the scenario-specific forecasts revert to long-term
historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On a quarterly basis, and within
a developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook. The Company uses judgment to assess these
economic conditions and loss data in determining the
best estimate of the allowance for credit losses and
these estimates are subject to periodic refinement
based on changes to underlying external or Companyspecific historical data.
In the quantitative component of our estimate, we
measure expected credit losses using an individual
evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the
asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class
of asset. For these assets, we do not employ the
macroeconomic model calculation but consider
factors such as payment status, collateral value, the
obligor’s financial condition, guarantor support, the
probability of collecting scheduled principal and
interest payments when due, and recovery
expectations if they can be reasonably estimated. For
loans, we measure the expected credit loss as the
difference between the amortized cost basis of the
loan and the present value of the expected future cash
flows from the borrower which is generally
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateraldependent. We generally individually evaluate
Results of Operations (continued)
BNY 23
nonperforming loans as well as loans that have been
modified given the risk characteristics of such loans.
Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair
value. When an available-for-sale debt security is in
an unrealized loss position, we employ a
methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss
portion of the unrealized loss position. The
measurement of expected credit losses is performed at
the security level and is based on our best single
estimate of cash flows, on a discounted basis;
however, we do not specifically employ the
macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios
summarized above.
The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors that include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We have made and may continue to make
adjustments for idiosyncratic risks.
To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs
and recoveries.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a
number of inputs, most notably the macroeconomic
forecast assumptions that are incorporated into our
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of
the loan portfolio, as well as credit ratings assigned to
each borrower. As the macroeconomic environment
and related forecasts change, the allowance for credit
losses may change materially. The following
sensitivity analyses do not represent management’s
expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as
hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs.
If commercial real estate property values were
increased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade better, the quantitative allowance would have
decreased by $47 million, and if commercial real
estate property values were decreased 10% and all
other credits were rated one grade worse, the
quantitative allowance would have increased by $82
million. Our multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast
used in determining the Dec. 31, 2024 allowance for
credit losses consisted of three scenarios. The
baseline scenario reflects positive but slightly
declining GDP growth through the first quarter of
2025 before moderating, stable unemployment and
slightly declining commercial real estate prices
through the end of 2025. The upside scenario reflects
higher GDP growth through the first quarter of 2025
before moderating, declining unemployment through
the end of 2025 and increasing commercial real estate
prices through the end of 2025 compared with the
baseline. The downside scenario contemplates
negative GDP growth through the third quarter of
2025 before moderating, rapidly increasing
unemployment through the third quarter of 2025 and
sharply lower commercial real estate prices through
the end of 2025 compared with the baseline. At Dec.
31, 2024, we placed the most weight on our baseline
scenario, with the remaining weighting equally placed
on the upside and downside scenarios. From a
sensitivity perspective, at Dec. 31, 2024, if we had
applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the
quantitative allowance for credit losses would have
been approximately $130 million higher.
See Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the allowance for credit losses.
Goodwill and other intangibles
We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. Goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles are
subsequently accounted for in accordance with ASC
350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. The initial
measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires
judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the
acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill ($16.6
billion at Dec. 31, 2024) and indefinite-lived
intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2024) are
not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment
annually or more often if events or circumstances
indicate it is more likely than not they may be
impaired. Other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives and are subject to
impairment if events or circumstances indicate a
possible inability to realize the carrying value.
Results of Operations (continued)
24 BNY
Goodwill
BNY’s business segments include seven reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is
performed on an annual basis. An interim goodwill
impairment test is performed when events or
circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit
may be less than its carrying value.
The goodwill impairment test compares the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value,
an impairment loss would be recorded for the
difference.
In each quarter of 2024, we completed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment
Management reporting unit, which had $6.0 billion of
allocated goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2024. In all cases,
we determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value and no goodwill impairment was recorded.
For the Dec. 31, 2024 test, the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 11%. We
determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit using an income approach
based on management’s projections as of Dec. 31,
2024. The discount rate applied to these cash flows
was 10.5%.
As of Dec. 31, 2024, if the discount rate applied to
the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased
by 25 basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would decrease or
increase by 4%, respectively. Similarly, if the longterm growth rate was increased or decreased by 10
basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would increase or
decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2024, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining six
reporting units using an income approach to estimate
the fair values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash
flows used in the income approach were based on
management’s projections as of April 1, 2024. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%.
As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no
goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair values
of the Company’s remaining six reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting
units’ carrying value.
Intangible assets
Key judgments in accounting for intangible assets
include determining the useful life and classification
between goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets or other amortizing intangible assets.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec.
31, 2024) are evaluated for impairment at least
annually by comparing their fair values, estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, to their carrying
values. As a result of the annual evaluation, no
impairment was recognized.
Other amortizing intangible assets ($275 million at
Dec. 31, 2024) are evaluated for impairment if events
and circumstances indicate a possible impairment.
Such evaluation of other intangible assets would be
initially based on undiscounted cash flow projections.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or
indefinite-lived intangible assets is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows
that extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are
difficult to estimate over such an extended time
frame. In the future, changes in the assumptions or
the discount rate could produce a material non-cash
goodwill or intangible asset impairment.
See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual
and interim impairment testing.
Litigation and regulatory contingencies
Significant estimates and judgments are required in
establishing an accrued liability for litigation and
regulatory contingencies. For additional information

the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated balance sheet review
One of our key risk management objectives is to
maintain a balance sheet that remains strong
throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of
our major stakeholders, including our shareholders,
clients, creditors and regulators.
We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk,
including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our
risk appetite. The objective of our balance sheet
management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet
that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset
quality, ready access to external funding sources at
competitive rates and a strong capital structure that
supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing
the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels
of liquidity and complying with applicable
regulations and supervisory expectations while
optimizing profitability.
At Dec. 31, 2024, total assets were $416 billion,
compared with $410 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
increase in total assets was primarily driven by higher
federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements, securities and loans, partially
offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks. Deposits
totaled $290 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with
$284 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily
reflects higher interest-bearing deposits in U.S.
offices, partially offset by lower interest-bearing
deposits in non-U.S. offices. Total interest-bearing
deposit liabilities as a percentage of total interestearning assets were 65% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 66% at
Dec. 31, 2023.
At Dec. 31, 2024, available funds totaled $144 billion
and include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and
federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available
funds of $158 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Total
available funds as a percentage of total assets were
35% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 38% at Dec. 31, 2023. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”
Securities were $137 billion, or 33% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $126 billion, or 31%
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase
primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government and
agency residential mortgage-backed securities
(“RMBS”), partially offset by lower U.S. Treasury
and U.S. government agency securities. For
additional information on our securities portfolio, see
“Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Loans were $72 billion, or 17% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2024, compared with $67 billion, or 16% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase was driven by
higher loans in the financial institutions and capital
call financing portfolios and higher margin loans,
partially offset by lower commercial loans. For
additional information on our loan portfolio, see
“Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Long-term debt totaled $30.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024
and $31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease
primarily reflects maturities, redemptions and a
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt,
partially offset by issuances. For additional
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends” and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at Dec. 31,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. For additional information,
see “Capital” and Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Securities
In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because
the information can indicate the degree of credit risk
to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit
risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase
in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in
the fair value of our securities portfolio.

The fair value of our securities portfolio was $132.1
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $121.5

Treasury and U.S. government agencies securities.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, of $6.2 billion, compared with $7.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, primarily reflects securities moving closer to
maturity.
The fair value of the available-for-sale securities
totaled $88.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 or 67% of the
securities portfolio. The fair value of the held-tomaturity securities totaled $44.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2024, or 33% of the securities portfolio.
The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-forsale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.2
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $1.6 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, was
primarily driven by securities moving closer to

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was
$48.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, an increase of 22%
compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting
higher exposure in the securities industry and banks
portfolios.
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with
96% of the exposures meeting the investment grade
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Dec. 31, 2024. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based
upon a number of dimensions, which are continually
evaluated and may change over time. For ratings of
non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating is
generally capped at a rating equivalent to the
sovereign rating of the country where the
counterparty resides, regardless of the internal credit
rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying
collateral.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally
short-term, with 84% of the exposures expiring
within one year. At Dec. 31, 2024, 18% of the
exposure to financial institutions had an expiration
within 90 days, compared with 19% at Dec. 31, 2023.

provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party
repo activity totaled $13.4 billion and was included in
the securities industry portfolio. Dealers secure the
outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid
collateral having a market value in excess of the
amount of the outstanding credit. Secured intraday
credit facilities represent 28% of the exposure in the
financial institutions portfolio and are reviewed and
reapproved annually.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is highquality, with 96% of the exposures meeting our
investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Dec.
31, 2024. These exposures are generally short-term
liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated
mutual funds.
Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to our
global trade finance. These exposures are short-term
in nature, with 95% due in less than one year. The
investment grade percentage of our banks exposure
was 85% at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with 84% at
Dec. 31, 2023. Our non-investment grade exposures
are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

The commercial portfolio exposure was $13.3 billion
at Dec. 31, 2024, a decrease of 1% from Dec. 31,
2023, primarily driven by lower exposure in the
services and other portfolio, partially offset by higher
exposure in the energy and utilities portfolio.
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade
clients that are active users of our non-credit services.

Wealth management loans
Our wealth management loan exposure was $9.4
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $9.6 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management loans
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth
individuals, a majority of which are secured by the
customers’ investment management accounts or
custody accounts.
Wealth management mortgages
Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.1
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $9.4 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management mortgages
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured by residential
property. Wealth management mortgages are
primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61% at
origination. Less than 1% of the mortgages were past
due at Dec. 31, 2024.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other –

Our commercial real estate exposure totaled $9.9
billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $10.2 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Our income-producing commercial real estate
facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation
facilities. Our client base consists of experienced
developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development
loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the
developer.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the unsecured portfolio consisted
of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real
estate operating companies, which are both primarily
investment grade.
At Dec. 31, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio
consisted of the following concentrations: New York
metro – 34%; REITs and real estate operating
companies – 29%; and other – 37%.
Lease financings
The lease financings portfolio exposure totaled $603
million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $599 million at Dec. 31,
2023. At Dec. 31, 2024, all of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified
assets, primarily real estate and large-ticket
transportation equipment. Assets are both domestic
and foreign-based, with primary concentrations in
Germany and the U.S.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and
totaled $1.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and are generally repaid within two
business days.
Capital call financing
Capital call financing includes loans to private equity
funds that are secured by the fund investors’ capital
commitments and the funds’ right to call capital.
Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that
are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds
and fixed-income securities.
Margin loans
Margin loan exposure of $19.1 billion at Dec. 31,
2024 and $18.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 was
collateralized with marketable securities. Borrowers
are required to maintain a daily collateral margin in
excess of 100% of the value of the loan. Margin
loans included $8 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $7
billion at Dec. 31, 2023 related to a term loan
program that offers fully collateralized loans to
broker-dealers.

Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our
primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to
lend, standby letters of credit and overdrafts associated with our custody and securities clearance businesses.

The provision for credit losses was $70 million in
2024, primarily driven by reserve increases related to
commercial real estate exposure and changes in the
macroeconomic forecast.
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for
lending-related commitments represent
management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in
our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the

management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit
losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates”
and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for
loans and lending-related commitments as presented
below.

(a) The allowance allocated to margins loans, overdrafts and
other loans was insignificant at both Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec.
31, 2023. We have rarely suffered a loss on these types of
loans.
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses
regardless of the nature of the losses.

Nonperforming assets decreased $58 million
compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting the
impact of nonperforming commercial real estate loans
that were charged off in 2024.
See “Nonperforming assets” in Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for our policy for
placing loans on nonaccrual status.
Deposits
We receive client deposits through the businesses in
the Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management segments
and we rely on those deposits as a low-cost and stable
source of funding.
Total deposits were $289.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2024,
an increase of 2%, compared with $283.7 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher
interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices, partially
offset by lower interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S.
offices.
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $58.3 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. Interest-bearing
deposits were primarily demand deposits and totaled
$231.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with
$225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign
customers in domestic offices was $58.8 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $55.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Deposits in non-U.S. offices totaled $95.6 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $96.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
These deposits were primarily overnight deposits.
Uninsured deposits are the portion of U.S. office
deposits accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance
limit. Uninsured deposits in U.S. office deposit
accounts are generally demand deposits and totaled
$168.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $168.4 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. Our uninsured U.S. office deposits
accounts reflect the amounts disclosed in our
regulatory reports, adjusted to exclude intercompany
deposit balances.

Short-term borrowings
We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to
a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and longterm debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and brokerdealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Certain short-term borrowings, for example,
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require
the delivery of securities as collateral.
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a
gross basis, but the ending and average balances
reflect the impact of offsetting under enforceable
netting agreements. This activity primarily relates to
government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are
novated to and settle with the FICC.
Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent
funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds
payable on demand. Payables to customers and
broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity
and market volatility.
The Bank of New York Mellon issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of
issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or
subject to voluntary prepayment.
Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Securities Services
businesses, and borrowings under lines of credit by
our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically relate
to timing differences for settlements.
Liquidity and dividends
BNY defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and
its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue
new debt, especially during periods of market stress,
at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet its shortterm (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity
risk is the risk that BNY cannot meet its cash and
collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both
expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral
needs without adversely affecting daily operations or
our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk can
arise from funding mismatches, market constraints
from the inability to convert assets into cash, the
inability to hold or raise cash, low overnight deposits,
deposit run-off or contingent liquidity events.
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to
credit, market, operational, legal and reputational
risks also can affect BNY’s liquidity risk profile and
are considered in our liquidity risk framework. For
additional information, see “Risk Management –
Liquidity Risk.”
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each
quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted
debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax
payments for the following 18-month period, and to
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions
subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and
funding needs within and across significant legal
entities, branches, currencies and business lines,
taking into account, among other factors, any
applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity
among entities.
BNY also manages potential intraday liquidity risks.
We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such
as cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity,
intraday contingency funding and available collateral)
to enable BNY to meet its intraday obligations under
normal and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

Total available funds as a percentage of total assets 35% 38% 36% 37% 34%
Total available funds were $144.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2024, compared with $157.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The decrease was primarily due to lower interestbearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks and interest-bearing deposits with
banks, partially offset by higher federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds
and commercial paper, were $20.4 billion for 2024
and $25.0 billion for 2023. The decrease primarily
reflects lower federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase agreements and lower trading
liabilities partially offset by higher commercial paper.
Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$141.3 billion for 2024 and $123.5 billion for 2023.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments,
were $92.9 billion for 2024, compared with $88.8
billion for 2023. The changes primarily reflect client
activity.
Average payables to customers and broker-dealers
were $12.7 billion for 2024 and $14.4 billion for
2023. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.
Average long-term debt was $31.8 billion for 2024
and $31.0 billion for 2023.
Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to
$49.5 billion for 2024 from $59.2 billion for 2023,
primarily reflecting client activity.
A significant reduction of client activity in our
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments would reduce our access to
deposits. See “Asset/liability management” for
additional factors that could impact our deposit
balances.
Sources of liquidity
The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to
the debt and equity markets, dividends from its
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to
the Parent through a committed credit facility with
our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in
place for liquidity purposes which is guaranteed by
the Parent for $300 million. Average borrowings
under this line were less than $1 million in 2024.
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of
BNY, has two separate uncommitted lines of credit
amounting to $247 million in aggregate. Average
borrowings under these lines were less than
$1 million, in aggregate, in 2024.
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our
consolidated Parent company equity, which includes
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to
which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent
company debt. As the double leverage ratio
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest
payments and debt maturities. BNY’s double
leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the
high level of unencumbered available liquid assets
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the
Company’s cash-generating fee-based business
model, with fee revenue representing 73% of total
revenue in 2024, and the dividend capacity of our
banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was
119.7% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 120.5% at Dec. 31,
2023, and within the range targeted by management.
Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.
In 2024, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends on our
common and preferred stock. Our common stock
dividend payout ratio was 31% for 2024.
In 2024, we repurchased 48.9 million common shares
at an average price of $62.70 per common share for a
total cost of $3.1 billion.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered highquality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to
withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical
standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY’s consolidated
HQLA at Dec. 31, 2024, and the average HQLA and
average LCR for the fourth quarter of 2024.

quarter of 2024 and $131 billion for the third quarter of
2024.
BNY and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the U.S. LCR
requirements of at least 100% throughout 2024.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)
The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to
large U.S. banking organizations, including BNY.
The NSFR is expressed as a ratio of the available
stable funding to the required stable funding amount
over a one-year horizon. Our average consolidated
NSFR was 132% for the fourth quarter of 2024 and
third quarter of 2024.
BNY and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR
requirement of at least 100% throughout the fourth
quarter of 2024.
Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on
the consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis
may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our
net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the
discussion related to liquidity and dividends and
asset/liability management herein may provide more
useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and
related activity.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $687
million in 2024, compared with $5.9 billion in 2023.
In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities
primarily resulted from earnings, partially offset by
changes in trading assets and liabilities. In 2023, net
cash provided by operating activities primarily
resulted from earnings and changes in accruals and
other, net.
Net cash used for investing activities was $9.5 billion
in 2024, compared with $5.8 billion in 2023. In
2024, net cash used for investing activities primarily
reflects changes in federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements, a net increase in
the securities portfolio and the net change in loans,
partially offset by changes in interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. In
2023, net cash used for investing activities primarily
reflects changes in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks and changes
in federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements, partially offset by a net decrease in
the securities portfolio.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3
billion in 2024, compared with net cash used for
financing activities of $3.5 billion in 2023. In 2024,
net cash provided by financing activities primarily
reflects changes in deposits and issuances of longterm debt, partially offset by repayments of long-term
debt and common stock repurchases. In 2023, net
cash used for financing activities primarily reflects
repayments of long-term debt, changes in payables to
customers and broker-dealers and common stock
repurchases, partially offset by issuances of long-term
debt and changes in deposits.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s total
shareholders’ equity increased to $41.3 billion at Dec.
31, 2024 from $40.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
increase primarily reflects earnings and an increase in
additional paid-in capital, partially offset by common
stock repurchases and dividend payments.
The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-forsale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.2
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $1.6 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, primarily reflects securities moving closer to
maturity.
We repurchased 48.9 million common shares at an
average price of $62.70 per common share for a total
of $3.1 billion in 2024.
In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity
under the existing January 2023 authorization.
In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common
stock, from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. We began
paying the increased quarterly cash dividend in the
third quarter of 2024.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the
Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding
company (“FHC”), our U.S. bank subsidiaries and
BNY must, among other things, qualify as “well
capitalized.” As of Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023,
BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” status or capital
adequacy rules more generally, could result in
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our
financial condition. See the discussion of these
matters in “Supervision and Regulation – Regulated
Entities of BNY and Ancillary Regulatory
Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory
standards, including “well capitalized” and “well
managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity
rules more generally, could result in limitations on
our activities and adversely affect our business and
financial condition.”
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on
the framework adopted by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from
time to time. For additional information on these
capital requirements, see “Supervision and
Regulation.”

capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement is 2.5%, equal to the regulatory minimum for Standardized Approach capital ratios.
(b) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as
calculated under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based on Tier 1 capital and quarterly
average total assets.
(c) The Federal Reserve’s regulations do not establish well capitalized thresholds for these measures for BHCs.
(d) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet exposures.
(e) The Bank of New York Mellon’s effective capital ratios under the U.S. capital rules are the lower of the ratios as calculated under the
Standardized and Advanced Approaches, which for Dec. 31, 2024 was the Standardized Approach for the CET1 and Tier 1 capital ratios
and the Advanced Approaches for the Total capital ratio, and for Dec. 31, 2023 was the Advanced Approaches.
N/A - Not applicable.
Our CET1 ratio determined under the Standardized
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 11.5% at
Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced Approaches. The
decrease was primarily driven by capital returned
through common stock repurchases and dividends
and higher RWAs, partially offset by capital
generated through earnings.
The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at Dec. 31, 2024,
compared with 6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease
was driven by higher average assets, partially offset
by an increase in capital.
Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size
of the balance sheet at period end and the levels and
types of investments in assets, and leverage ratios
vary based on the average size of the balance sheet
over the quarter. The balance sheet size fluctuates
from period to period based on levels of customer and
market activity. In general, when servicing clients
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances
and the balance sheet as a whole are higher. In
addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may
increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among
other things, anticipated compliance with all
necessary enhancements to model calibration,
approval by regulators of certain models used as part
of RWA calculations, other refinements, further
implementation guidance from regulators, market
practices and standards and any changes BNY may
make to its businesses. As a consequence of these
factors, our capital ratios may materially change, and
may be volatile over time and from period to period.
Under the Advanced Approaches, our operational loss
risk model is informed by external losses, including
fines and penalties levied against institutions in the
financial services industry, particularly those that
relate to businesses in which we operate, and as a

Stress capital buffer
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that
BNY’s SCB requirement would remain at 2.5%,
equal to the regulatory floor, for the period from Oct.
1, 2023 through Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB replaced
the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Standardized Approach capital ratios for
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(“CCAR”) BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer. In August 2024, the
Federal Reserve announced that BNY’s SCB
requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2024
through Sept. 30, 2025. See “Supervision and
Regulation” for additional information.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the
requirement for prior approval of common stock
repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm’s
capital plan, provided that such distributions are
consistent with applicable capital requirements and

satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible LTD
consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible
unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for
amounts due to be paid within two years, that satisfy
certain other conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec.
31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
extent these instruments otherwise would be

authorized share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of

under the existing January 2023 authorization.
Share repurchases may be executed through open
market repurchases, in privately negotiated
transactions or by other means, including through
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share
repurchase and other structured transactions. The
timing and exact amount of any common stock
repurchases will depend on various factors, including
market conditions and the common stock trading
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.
Trading activities and risk management
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with
the Volcker Rule. The risk from market-making
activities for customers is managed by our traders and
limited in total exposure through a system of position
limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other
market sensitivity measures. VaR is the potential loss
in value due to adverse market movements over a
defined time horizon with a specified confidence
level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different
risk characteristics. VaR also captures the
diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide
level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and
it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR,
which include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer
time horizons where moves may be extreme;
• VaR does not take into account the potential
variability of market liquidity; and
• Previous moves in market risk factors may not
produce accurate predictions of all future market
moves.
See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.
The following tables indicate the calculated VaR
amounts for the trading portfolio for the designated

N/M – Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different
days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to
compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification
effect.
The interest rate component of VaR represents
instruments whose values are predominantly driven
by interest rate levels. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, swaps,
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded
futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not
limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency
derivative products.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments
that represent an ownership interest in the form of
domestic and foreign common stock or other equitylinked instruments. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded
funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and
calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps,
equity index futures and other equity derivative
products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by credit
spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, single
issuer credit default swaps, and securities with
exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk
reduction benefit that occurs when combining
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the
correlated behavior of risk factor movements.
During 2024, interest rate risk generated 43% of
average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated
35% of average gross VaR, equity risk generated 1%
of average gross VaR and credit risk generated 21%
of average gross VaR. During 2024, our daily trading
loss exceeded our calculated VaR amount of the
overall portfolio on only one occasion.

(a) Trading revenue (loss) includes realized and unrealized gains and
losses primarily related to spot and forward foreign exchange
transactions, derivatives and securities trades for our customers and
excludes any associated commissions, underwriting fees and net
interest income.
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments
and derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading assets were $14.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $10.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments
and derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange
and interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $4.9 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Under our fair value methodology for derivative
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is
performed on each position assuming time
discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of
our derivatives.
We reflect external credit ratings as well as
observable credit default swap spreads for both
ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the
fair value of our derivative positions. Accordingly,
the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to
the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well
as those of our counterparties.

At Dec. 31, 2024, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $3.7
billion included a credit valuation adjustment
(“CVA”) deduction of $11 million. Our OTC
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging
relationships, of $2.9 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $7 million related
to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA
increased by less than $1 million and the DVA
decreased by less than $1 million in 2024, which
decreased other trading revenue by $1 million in
2024. During 2024, no realized loss was charged off
against CVA reserves.
At Dec. 31, 2023, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.3
billion included a CVA deduction of $16 million.
Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.8 billion included a DVA
of $4 million related to our own credit spread. Net of
hedges, the CVA increased by $1 million and the
DVA increased by $1 million in 2023, which
increased other trading revenue by less than $1
million in 2023. During 2023, no realized loss was
charged off against CVA reserves.
The table below summarizes our exposure, net of
collateral related to our derivative counterparties, as
determined on an internal risk management basis.

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and
other transactions. The market risks from these
activities include interest rate risk and foreign
exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure
to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain
foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage
interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool
used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest income
between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest
rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified
by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest
income between the scenarios over a 12-month
measurement period.
The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s
forward rate expectations and management’s
assumptions regarding client deposit rates, credit
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans
and securities and the impact of derivative financial
instruments used for interest rate risk management
purposes as of each respective quarter-end. These
assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results
due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest
rate changes, and changes in market conditions and
management’s strategies, among other factors. Client
deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting
net interest income in the baseline as well as the
hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The earnings
simulation model assumes static deposit levels and
mix, and it also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate
changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the quarter.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation
model to assess the impact of various hypothetical
interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline
scenario. In each of the scenarios, all currencies’
interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or
lower at the start of the forecast. Long-term interest
rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than
three years and short-term interest rates are defined as
all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim
term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The
results of this earnings simulation should therefore
not be extrapolated for more severe interest rate
scenarios than those presented in the table below.

At Dec. 31, 2024, the changes in the impacts of a 100
basis point upward or downward shift in rates on net
interest income compared with Sept. 30, 2024 were
primarily driven by an increase in fixed-rate assets
and floating rate liabilities.
While the net interest income sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to
facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons,
net interest income is impacted by changes in deposit
balances and interest rate trajectory. Noninterestbearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes
in short-term rates.
To illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to noninterest-bearing deposits, we estimate that a $5 billion
instantaneous reduction/increase in U.S. dollardenominated noninterest-bearing deposits would
reduce/increase the net interest income sensitivity
results in the up 100 basis point rate shock scenario in
the table above by approximately $260 million, and in
the down 100 basis point rate shock scenario by
approximately $160 million. The impact would be
smaller if the reduction/increase was assumed to be a
mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits.
Additionally, during periods of low short-term
interest rates, money market mutual fund fees and
other similar fees are typically waived to protect
investors from negative returns.
For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital
and Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected if we do not effectively manage our
liquidity.”
We also project future cash flows from our assets and
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks
to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the
structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by
discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of
these discounted cash flows is the economic value of
equity (“EVE”). The following table shows how
EVE would change in response to changes in interest
rates.
Estimated changes in EVE Dec. 31,
2024
Rate change:
Up 200 bps vs. baseline (1.9) %
Up 100 bps vs. baseline —%
Down 100 bps vs. baseline (0.7) %
Down 200 bps vs. baseline (2.4) %
The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory
capital, even though economically there may be no
impact on our economic capital position. For
example, an increase in rates will result in a decline in
the value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
In this example, there is no corresponding change on
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise.
These results do not reflect strategies that
management could employ to limit the impact as
interest rate expectations change.
To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign
currency-denominated assets with liability
instruments denominated in the same currency. We
utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability
denominated in the same currency is not available or
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of
translation gains or losses created by investments in
foreign markets. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts to protect the value of our net investment in
foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2024, net investments
in foreign operations totaled $14 billion and were
spread across 19 foreign currencies.

BNY 47
Overview
BNY plays a vital role in the global financial markets,
and effective risk management is critical to our
success. BNY operates under the Enterprise Risk
Management Framework (“risk management
framework”) which is the foundation of our risk
management approach. Risk management begins
with a strong risk culture, and we reinforce our
culture through principle-based policies including the
Code of Conduct, which are grounded in our core
values of passion for excellence, integrity, strength in
diversity and courage to lead.
These values are critical to our success. They not
only explain what we stand for and our shared
culture, but also help us to think and act globally.
They serve as a representation of the promises we
have made to our clients, communities, shareholders
and each other.
BNY’s Risk Identification process is a core
component of BNY’s risk framework and is the
foundation for understanding and managing risk. We
utilize a common risk language, our Risk Taxonomy,
to identify risks across our six primary risk
categories: Operational Risk, Market Risk, Credit
Risk, Liquidity Risk, Model Risk and Strategic Risk.
Quarterly, the Company engages in a process
designed to document identification and assessment
of its risks, and to determine the set of risks material
to BNY. Outputs from the Risk Identification process
inform elements of our risk framework such as our
Risk Appetite as well as Enterprise-wide Stress
Testing and Capital Planning.
BNY’s Risk Appetite expresses the level of risk we
are willing to tolerate to meet our strategic objectives
in a manner that balances risk and reward while
considering our risk capacity and maintaining a
balance sheet that remains resilient throughout market
cycles. This guides BNY’s risk-taking activities and
informs key decision-making processes, including the
manner by which we pursue our business strategy and
the methods by which we manage risk. The Risk
Appetite Statement and associated key risk metrics to
monitor our risk profile are updated and approved by
the Risk Committee of the Board at least annually.
BNY conducts Enterprise-wide Stress Testing as part
of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
in accordance with CCAR, and as required by the
enhanced prudential standards issued pursuant to the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). Enterprisewide Stress Testing considers the Company’s lines of
business, products, geographic areas and risk types
incorporating the results from underlying models and
projections for a range of stress scenarios. Additional
details on Capital Planning and Stress Testing are
included in “Supervision and Regulation.”
Three Lines of Defense
BNY’s three lines of defense model is a critical
component of our risk management framework to
clarify roles and responsibilities across the
organization.
BNY’s first line of defense includes senior
management and business and corporate staff,
excluding management and employees in Risk
Management, Compliance and Internal Audit. Senior
management in the first line is responsible for
maintaining and implementing an effective risk
management framework and appropriately managing
risk consistent with its strategy and risk tolerance,
including establishing clear responsibilities and
accountability for the identification, measurement,
management and control of risk.
Risk and Compliance is the independent second line
of defense, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The
Chief Risk Officer reports to both the Chief
Executive Officer and the Risk Committee of the
Company’s Board of Directors. Risk and
Compliance is responsible for establishing policies,
expectations and guidance for managing risk at BNY
while also independently monitoring, reviewing and
challenging the first line. To facilitate the
comprehensive global application of consistent
standards for each risk or compliance topic,
independent oversight is provided by Risk and
Compliance across three perspectives – lines of
business; legal entities; and enterprise-wide risk and
compliance disciplines.
Internal Audit is BNY’s third line of defense and
serves as an independent, objective assurance
function that reports directly to the Audit Committee
of the Company’s Board of Directors. It assists the
Company in accomplishing its objectives by bringing
a systematic, disciplined, risk-based approach to
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the
Company’s risk management, control and governance
processes. The scope of Internal Audit’s work
Risk Management
48 BNY
includes the review and evaluation of the adequacy,
effectiveness and sustainability of risk management
procedures, internal control systems, information
systems and governance processes.
Governance
BNY’s management is responsible for execution of the Company’s risk management framework and the governance
structure that supports it, with oversight provided by BNY’s Board of Directors through two key Board committees:
the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee.
A summary of the governance structure is provided below.

Risk Management (continued)
50 BNY
Risk Types Overview
The understanding, identification, measurement and mitigation of risk are essential elements for the successful
management of BNY. We leverage a comprehensive risk taxonomy to support consistent language for defining and
understanding risks. The primary categories in our risk taxonomy are:
Type of risk Description
Operational The risk of loss and/or regulatory, legal or reputational impact resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk includes risks, such as compliance
and financial crimes, technology risks and third party risks.
Market The risk of financial loss or adverse change to the economic condition of BNY resulting from movements
in market risk factors. Market risk factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads,
foreign exchanges rates, commodity prices, and equity prices.
Credit Credit risk denotes a broad category of adverse financial outcomes arising from credit events (default,
bankruptcy, ratings migration) associated with obligor/counterparty not meeting (inability/unwilling) its
contractual obligations. Credit risk is present in the majority of our assets, but primarily concentrated in
the loan and securities books, as well as foreign exchange and off-balance sheet exposures such as lending
commitments, letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications.
Liquidity The risk arising from an inability to access funding, convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll
over or issue new debt, especially during periods of market stress. Liquidity risk includes the inability to
access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk can arise from cash flow
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to convert assets to cash, the inability to raise cash in the
markets, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity events.
Model The potential loss arising from incorrectly designing/using a model or stress conditions that invalidate the
assumptions of a model.
Strategic The risk arising from the flawed design, decision or implementation of a business strategy, and potential
disruption to business strategy by external factors and/or internal decisions. More specifically, the risks
arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions or lack of
responsiveness to changes in the financial industry and operating environment. Strategic risks may also
arise from the acceptance of new businesses, the introduction or modification of products, strategic finance
and risk management decisions, business process changes, complex transactions, acquisitions/divestitures/
joint ventures and major capital expenditures/investments.
Operational risk
In providing a comprehensive array of products and
services, we are exposed to operational risk.
Operational risk may result from, but is not limited to,
errors related to transaction processing, failure of
internal control systems and meeting compliance
requirements, fraud by employees or persons outside
BNY or business interruption due to system failures
or other events. Operational risk may also include
breaches of our technology and information systems
resulting in unauthorized access to confidential
information or from internal or external threats, such
as cyberattacks. Operational risk also includes
potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise.
In the case of an operational event, we could suffer
financial losses as well as reputational damage.
To address these risks, we maintain comprehensive
policies and procedures and an internal control
framework designed to provide a sound operational
environment. These controls have been designed to
manage operational risk at appropriate levels given
our financial strength, the business environment and
markets in which we operate, and the nature of our
businesses, and considering factors such as
competition and regulation.
The organizational framework for operational risk is
based upon a strong risk culture that incorporates
both governance and risk management activities
comprising:
• Accountability of Businesses – Business
managers are responsible for maintaining an
effective system of internal controls
commensurate with the business risk profiles and
in accordance with BNY policies and procedures.
• Operational Risk Management is the independent
second line function responsible for developing
risk management policies and tools for assessing,
measuring, monitoring and managing operational
risk for BNY. The primary objectives of the
Operational Risk Management Framework are to
promote effective risk management, identify
emerging risks and drive improvement in controls
and to reduce operational risk. The Operational
Risk Management (continued)
BNY 51
Risk Management function includes independent
operational risk oversight of all lines of business
and functions, as well as specialist oversight of
areas such as data risk, fraud risk, and third party
risk.
• Technology risk is a subset of operational risk.
Technology Risk Management is part of the
second line of defense risk function providing
oversight over technology risks in an effort to
improve the likelihood that technology risks are
identified, considered, and managed effectively
against the stated risk appetite of the Company.
Technology Risk Management is responsible for
developing risk management policies and tools in
an effort to identify and manage risks across
cyber, infrastructure, applications, and resiliency
and is responsible for confirming such policies
and tools are well understood by the first line of
defense. Further, Technology Risk Management
oversees the risk reporting process through our
governance and that the risks are managed within
our defined risk appetite and risk management
framework. Technology Risk Management uses
its expertise in engaging in centralized activities
and capabilities, and data-driven methodologies.
Additionally, Technology Risk Management acts
as a catalyst to drive the development of global
technology policies, key controls, and methods to
assess, measure, and monitor information and
technology risk for BNY. The function also
conducts integrated independent assessments on
multiple cyber and digital initiatives within the
Company and works to drive better understanding
and a more accurate assessment of technology
risks.
• Operational resiliency is a strategic priority for
the Company. Foundational to our enterprise
resiliency strategy is the Business Services
Framework, governed by the first line Enterprise
Resiliency Office, with second line oversight
from Resiliency Risk Management. First line
business management is accountable for
maintaining effective resiliency capabilities under
this framework, while Engineering and
Operations are responsible for successful
execution in coordination with the business.
Elements of the resiliency strategy include the
Business Services Framework, management of
technology assets, Incident and Crisis
Management, as well as Disaster Recovery
Testing and Business Continuity capabilities. We
are also focused on the resiliency capabilities of
our third-party service providers. These
processes are intended to position the Company
to continuously deliver services to our clients
through our ability to prevent, respond to and
recover from business disruptions and threats.
• Compliance and financial crimes risk is also a
subset of operational risk with second line
Compliance and Ethics and Financial Crime
Compliance teams. Compliance and financial
crimes risk is defined as the risk of legal or
regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or a
financial institution’s reputational loss as a result
of its failure to comply with laws, regulations,
rules, related self-regulatory organizational
standards, and codes of conduct or organizational
standards of practice. We seek to comply with all
obligations through a comprehensive, integrated
Compliance and Ethics Management Framework.
Market risk
Our business activity tends to minimize outright our
direct exposure to market risk, with such risk
primarily limited to market volatility from trading
activity in support of clients. More significant market
risk is assumed in the form of interest rate and credit
spread risk within the investment portfolio as a means
for asset/liability management and net interest income
generation, and also through the interest rate risk
associated with BNY’s balance sheet position which
is sensitive to adverse movements in interest rates.
The Company has indirect market risk exposure
associated with the change in the value of financial
collateral underlying securities financing and
derivatives positions. The Collateral Margin Review
Committee reviews and approves the standards for
collateral received or paid in respect of collateralized
derivative agreements and securities financing
transactions. The Markets business monitors its
market risk through a variety of metrics including
trading VaR and trading stressed VaR. Finally, the
Risk Quantification Review Group reviews backtesting results for the Company’s VaR model.
Credit risk
We extend direct credit in order to foster client
relationships and as a method by which to generate
interest income from the deposits that result from
business activity. We extend and incur intraday
credit exposure in order to facilitate our various
processing activities.
Risk Management (continued)
52 BNY
To balance the value of our activities with the credit
risk incurred in pursuing them, we set and monitor
internal credit limits for activities that entail credit
risk, most often on the size of the exposure and the
quality of the counterparty. For credit exposures
driven by changing market rates and prices, exposure
measures include an add-on for such potential
changes.
We manage credit risk exposure at a counterparty,
industry, country and portfolio level. Credit risk
exposure at the counterparty level is managed through
our credit approval framework and involves four
approval levels up to and including the Chief Risk
Officer of the Company. The requisite approvals are
based upon the size and relative risk of the aggregate
exposure under consideration. The Credit Risk
Group is responsible for approving the size, terms and
maturity of all credit exposures proposed by the
business, as well as the ongoing monitoring of the
creditworthiness of the counterparty. In addition, it is
responsible for challenging and approving the internal
risk ratings on each exposure.
The calculation of a fundamental credit measure is
based on a projection of a statistically probable credit
loss, used to help determine the appropriate loan loss
reserve and to measure customer profitability. Credit
loss considers three basic components: the estimated
size of the exposure whenever default might occur,
the probability of default before maturity and the
severity of the loss we would incur, commonly called
“loss given default.” Borrowers/counterparties are
assigned ratings by the business and reviewed,
challenged and approved by the Credit Portfolio
Managers on an 18-grade scale, which translate to a
scaled probability of default. Additionally,
transactions are assigned loss given default ratings
(on a 5-grade scale) that reflect the transactions’
structures, including the effects of guarantees,
collateral and relative seniority of position.
The Risk Modeling and Analytics Group is
responsible for the calculation methodologies and the
estimates of the inputs used in those methodologies
for the determination of expected loss. These
methodologies and input estimates are regularly
evaluated for appropriateness and accuracy. As new
techniques and data become available, the Risk
Modeling and Analytics Group incorporates, where
appropriate, those techniques or data.
BNY seeks to limit both on- and off-balance sheet
credit risk through prudent underwriting and the use
of capital only where risk-adjusted returns warrant.
We seek to manage risk and improve our portfolio
diversification through syndications, asset sales,
credit enhancements and active collateralization and
netting agreements. In addition, we have a separate
Credit Risk Review Group, which is an independent
group within Internal Audit, composed of
experienced loan review officers who perform timely
reviews of the loan files and credit ratings assigned to
the loans.
Liquidity risk
Adequate liquidity is vital to BNY’s ability to process
payments as well as settle and clear transactions on
behalf of clients. The Company’s liquidity position
can be affected by multiple factors, including funding
mismatches, market conditions that impact our ability
to convert our investment portfolio to cash, inability
to issue debt or roll over funding, run-off of core
deposits, and contingent liquidity events such as
additional collateral posting requirements.
Additionally, a downgrade in our credit rating cannot
only lead to an outflow of deposits, which are a major
source of our funding, but also increase our margin
requirements on secured transactions and have a
broader adverse impact on our overall brand that may
further impair our ability to refinance maturing
liabilities. Changes in economic conditions or
exposure to other risks can also affect our liquidity.
The Board of Directors approves liquidity risk
tolerance and is responsible for oversight of liquidity
risk management of the Company. ALCO provides
governance for the appropriate execution of Boardapproved strategies, policies and procedures for
managing liquidity. Senior management is
responsible for executing those Board-approved
strategies, policies and procedures for managing
liquidity which ALCO oversees, as well as regularly
reporting the liquidity position of the Company to the
Board of Directors. The BSRC provides governance
over independent risk oversight of liquidity risks, and
oversees the establishment of control frameworks.
BNY actively manages and monitors its cash
position, quality of the investment portfolio, intraday
liquidity positions and potential liquidity needs in
order to support the timely payment and settlement of
obligations under both normal and stressed
conditions. The Company uses a range of stress
testing measures in connection with its efforts to

maintain sufficient liquidity relative to risk appetite,
including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Internal
Liquidity Stress Testing.
Model risk
Models support our infrastructure for managing risk.
Among their functions, models help us value
securities, rate the quality of an obligor’s credit,
establish capital needs and monitor liquidity trends.
Model failure might stem from faulty design, misuse,
or environmental conditions that invalidate our
assumptions. When this happens, the Company could
be exposed to losses and other adverse consequences
resulting from operational, market, credit and
liquidity risk, as well as reputational harm. We aim
to maintain a low-risk environment.
BNY’s processes are designed to identify the
conditions under which model risk incidents could
occur and to establish controls that are designed to
minimize or prevent loss in case of such an event.
These processes include enforcement of standards for
developing models, a process to validate new models,
change controls for existing models, and a monitoring
system to assess performance throughout a model’s
life.
When evaluating the degree of model risk, we
consider multiple dimensions, including the quality of
design, the robustness of controls, and indications of
underperformance. Based on these measures, we
create an overall metric that is intended to measure
the health of the Company’s modeling environment
and set thresholds around it. This allows us to
manage model risk, not only at the level of the
individual model, but also in aggregate, across all the
Company’s businesses.
Strategic risk
Our strategy includes, but is not limited to, improving
organic growth across our businesses, delivering
quality solutions and evolving our operating model.
Successful realization of our strategy requires that we
provide expertise, insight and market-leading and
technology-enabled products and services that drive
economies of scale. Additionally, it requires
attracting, developing and retaining highly talented
people capable of executing our strategy, while
safeguarding our financial profile. Failure to achieve
these objectives may negatively impact both our
growth strategy and our ability to service our existing
clients, resulting in potential financial loss or
litigation.
The markets in which we and our clients operate can
evolve quickly. The introduction of new or disruptive
technologies, geopolitical events and economic
slowdowns are examples of factors that can create
market uncertainty. Failure to anticipate or
participate in transformational change within a given
market or appropriately and promptly react to market
conditions or client preferences could result in poor
strategic positioning and potential negative financial
impact. While it is essential that we continue to
innovate and respond to changing markets and client
demand, we strive to do so in a manner that does not
adversely affect our financial position or compromise
our fundamental business strategy.
Other Risk Considerations
In addition to the primary risk categories and subcategories noted above, we consider risks that have
significance and may manifest across multiple
categories of risk. These risk considerations include
data risk, fraud risk, third party risk, environmental,
social and governance risk, reputational risk and
geopolitical and country risk.
Data risk
We are exposed to data management risk when we
fail to consistently manage and control our data assets
through the entire lifecycle, including managing the
production, confidentiality, quality, integrity,
availability, and retention of data information.
Our risk management approach considers data risks
within our business activities. Our Data Management
Framework and supporting policies address
management of data in key areas of data architecture,
data governance, data quality management, data
protection, data usage and ethics.
Emphasis is placed on data quality through data
policies, regular quality assessments, and continuous
improvement programs aimed at enhancing data
integrity. The data architecture must be resilient and
scalable to support the complex and evolving needs
of the business. Efforts are made to strengthen the
control environment in mitigating data management
risks, aiming to achieve a higher data maturity level
which enables the integration of innovative data
solutions.
Risk Management (continued)
54 BNY
We also consider data risks in the execution of our
business objectives and processes, including the
development of new products and services, including
AI applications. We remain committed to increasing
the effectiveness of our data management practices
which are designed to enable us to deliver products
and services to our clients across the investment
lifecycle.
Fraud risk
Fraud risk, the risk associated with an internal or
external party deliberately performing an activity that
relies on deception to achieve financial gain to the
detriment of BNY or its clients or affiliated or related
parties, is an inherent risk as part of our business. As
part fraud prevention, we utilize tools which include
culture and awareness campaigns, risk identification,
risk assessment and risk mitigation which help us
understand key fraud risks and controls and to
educate employees about the expectations of
identifying and reporting fraud attempts in order to
protect assets of BNY and its clients.
Third party risk
Third party risk arises from an adverse impact on the
Company due to reliance on third parties, including
vendors, that provide goods or perform services or
other benefits on our behalf or on behalf of our
clients. As part of our third-party risk management
framework, we identify, evaluate, measure, mitigate,
monitor and re-assess risks in an attempt to reduce the
likelihood of, and negative impacts from, operational
failures throughout the lifecycle of an engagement
with a third party.
Environmental, social and governance
We are exposed to environmental, social and
governance risks factors that may lead to increased
risk levels across one or more enterprise risk
categories and may impact our risk management
frameworks. For example, climate risks include
physical risks from acute and chronic weather-related
effects as well as transition risks from changes such
as fiscal policy, legislation and regulation,
technological development, and investor and
customer preference changes. Social and governance
risks could also impact our risk categories and risk
management frameworks.
These effects may be wide-ranging with potential
financial and operational resilience implications that
could negatively impact the Company’s strategic
objectives and financial performance, reputation,
business operations, ability to service clients and
broad stakeholder relationships. Potential risk
outcomes include, but are not limited to, adverse
publicity, loss of business, financial loss, litigation,
employee impacts, and other operational impacts.
For example, climate-related impacts have been
identified across our credit portfolios, strategic
positioning, operational resiliency, and the pace and
volume of regulatory change, with the potential for
reputational impacts across these areas. Thus, these
risk factors are considered when managing risk within
appetite and limits across the enterprise risk
categories.
Reputational risk
We are exposed to Reputational Risk as a result of
negative stakeholder perception which may result
from any decision, action, or inaction by BNY, any of
our employees, or through other associated parties,
such as clients, strategic partners, and third parties.
Reputational impacts can result in risks to current or
anticipated earnings, capital, liquidity, brand, and
enterprise value, and can stem from any line of
business, corporate function, legal entity, product, or
service.
Geopolitical and country risk
We are exposed to the effects of geopolitical events,
including tensions between nations and/or regions
that may disrupt the stability of international
relations, economies or markets. Geopolitical event
risks include wars, trade or territorial disputes,
sanctions, cybersecurity conflicts, nuclear
advancements, the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory
measures, shifts in alliances and government policy
changes that impact global systems and stakeholders.
These events can affect macroeconomic factors and
financial markets which could result in losses to BNY
or its clients. We are also exposed to the risks
associated with maintaining commercial relationships
within or connected to sovereign jurisdictions which,
among other things, may not possess: an independent
judiciary, a history of political pluralism, robust
protections for private property (including intellectual
property), traditions of free enterprise or the rule of
law, or similar attributes. We monitor geopolitical
events to assess and measure the potential impact on
BNY.
Risk Management (continued)
BNY 55
BNY maintains a broad range of defenses aimed at
remaining abreast of and responding to evolving
cybersecurity threats impacting the Company, its
operations, its clients, its third-party service providers
and the broader financial services sector. During
2024, cybersecurity threats did not have a material
effect on the Company’s business strategy or
operations. However, the financial services sector is
prone to cybersecurity threats, and there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to
successfully protect its information systems against
material cybersecurity incidents in the future. Given
the increasing prevalence and severity of
cybersecurity incidents affecting financial
institutions, other companies and governmental
agencies as well as the evolving and adaptive nature
of cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity risk
management is a priority for the Company that
impacts its allocation of resources, operations and
risk management strategy. For a further discussion of
the various risks related to cybersecurity threats and
the potential impact on the Company’s business
strategy, results of operations or financial condition,
see “Risk Factors – Operational Risk.”
Risk management strategy and procedures
BNY has implemented policies and procedures
designed to detect, prevent and respond to malicious
and accidental disruptions to the delivery of critical
technology services. BNY’s cybersecurity risk
management program is embedded in the Company’s
three lines of defense model.
As part of its first line of defense, the Company
maintains a dedicated Information Security Division
(“ISD”), led by the Chief Information Security
Officer (the “CISO”), that is responsible for the dayto-day management of risks from cybersecurity
threats. ISD’s responsibilities include cybersecurity
threat intelligence, incident response and other
cybersecurity operations aimed at enabling the
Company to identify, assess and manage existing and
emerging cybersecurity threats. ISD monitors for
potential threats and communicates relevant risks to
the CISO and other members of executive
management. Additionally, ISD maintains a
cybersecurity incident response and reporting process
pursuant to which cybersecurity incidents are
classified according to their severity based upon an
assessment of multiple factors. Certain cybersecurity
incidents may activate enterprise-wide resiliency
processes, which include, among other things,
escalation through the management and Board
committee structures described below. In addition,
the Company maintains a preparedness program
designed to reinforce cybersecurity risk management
practices and compliance with the Company’s
policies and procedures. The preparedness program
includes mandatory training for all employees,
contractors and consultants, enhanced training for
those in roles presenting higher risk, calibrated
phishing email simulations, distribution of
information security awareness materials and
cybersecurity event simulation exercises. In addition,
the Company leverages both internal and external
assessments and engages with third-party assessors,
consultants and auditors to evaluate and test its
cybersecurity controls and provide guidance on
potential improvements, including design and
operating effectiveness. The Company has standing
arrangements with third parties to assist the Company
in identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity
threats, including in connection with risk
assessments, penetration testing, legal advice and
other aspects of the Company’s cybersecurity risk
management and incident response processes.
BNY has a defined third-party governance framework
to help manage the risk posed to the Company by the
use of third-party service providers. The Company
evaluates the risk posed by third-party service
engagements based on multiple factors. The
Company has protocols that seek to mitigate
cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service
providers based on the risk level assigned to such
third party, which may include mandatory contractual
obligations or the implementation of additional
controls by the Company and/or the applicable
service provider.
ISD is subject to ongoing review and challenge from
Technology Risk Management, which is a part of the
independent second line of defense risk function.
Technology Risk Management, together with the
broader Risk & Compliance group, is responsible for
and manages the Company’s risk management
framework and establishes guidance for ISD and
management designed to help identify, assess and
manage cybersecurity risk. For more information on
how we monitor and manage our risk management
framework, see “Risk Management – Overview.”
Internal Audit serves as the third line of defense and
provides an independent view on how effectively the
organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk.
Cybersecurity
56 BNY
For a further discussion of BNY’s three lines of
defense model, see “Risk Management – Three Lines
of Defense.”
Risk management oversight and governance
The Company’s management is responsible for
assessing and managing the Company’s material risks
from cybersecurity threats with oversight provided by
the Parent’s Board of Directors and the Board
committees. The Risk Committee of the Board has
primary responsibility for oversight of the overall
operation of the Company’s risk management
framework, including policies and practices
addressing cybersecurity risk, and is responsible for
the oversight of the second line of defense with
respect to its cybersecurity risk management
responsibilities. The Technology Committee of the
Board and the full Board regularly receive reports and
briefings from management concerning cybersecurity
matters, including any significant changes to the
Company’s cybersecurity program. The Company
also has protocols for escalating cybersecurity threats
and incidents to the Technology Committee of the
Board and the full Board. In addition, the Audit
Committee monitors and oversees the performance of
Internal Audit, including with respect to its
cybersecurity risk management responsibilities.
At the management level, the Technology Oversight
Committee, which is the senior management
committee responsible for the governance and
oversight of the Company’s significant technology
projects and initiatives, reviews reports from
management concerning ISD and is responsible for,
among other things, escalating issues, including
significant cybersecurity threats and incidents, to the
Technology Committee of the Board. The
Technology Oversight Committee is chaired by the
Chief Information Officer (the “CIO”) and its
members include the CISO.
The Technology Risk Committee is the most senior
governance committee primarily focused on
cybersecurity and technology risk issues and is a part
of the second line of defense risk function. It is
responsible for, among other things, overseeing and
reviewing emerging cybersecurity risks, significant
cybersecurity incidents and remediation plans. The
Technology Risk Committee receives reports from
management and has protocols for escalating certain
issues and risks to the SRCC and the Risk Committee
of the Board of Directors. The Technology Risk
Committee is chaired by the interim Chief
Technology Risk Officer. Members include key
leaders from the first line of defense, including the
CISO.
BNY’s CIO, CISO and interim Chief Technology
Risk Officer each have extensive experience in
assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity
threats. The Company’s CISO joined BNY in 2022
and previously served as head of information security
at a Fortune 500 biopharmaceutical company and an
information technology company, as well as the
Global Chief Technology Officer at a large
cybersecurity company. The Company’s CIO joined
BNY in September 2024 from a large multinational
company, where she was responsible for overseeing
information technology and cybersecurity operations.
The Company’s interim Chief Technology Risk
Officer joined BNY in November 2024 and has
previous experience as Global Head of Cyber,
Technology and Information Security Risk
Management at a global systemically important
financial institution and over a decade of experience
serving the U.S. intelligence community in a variety
of cybersecurity-related positions.

governance structure, see “Risk Management –
Governance.”
Cybersecurity (continued)
BNY 57
Evolving Regulatory Environment
BNY engages in banking, investment advisory and
other financial activities across the globe and is
subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in
which it operates. Global supervisory authorities
generally are charged with ensuring the safety and
soundness of financial institutions, protecting the
interests of customers, including depositors in
banking entities and investors in mutual funds and
other pooled vehicles, safeguarding the integrity of
securities and other financial markets and promoting
systemic resiliency and financial stability in the
relevant country. They are not, however, generally
charged with protecting the interests of our
shareholders or non-depositor creditors. This
discussion outlines the material elements of selected
laws and regulations applicable to us. The impact of
certain other laws and regulations, such as tax law, is
discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. Changes
in these standards, or in their application, cannot be
predicted, but may have a material effect on our
businesses and results of operations.
The financial services industry has been the subject of
enhanced regulatory oversight in the past 15 years
globally, and this enhanced oversight environment is
likely to continue in the future. Our businesses have
been subject to a significant number of global reform
measures. Moreover, political developments have
resulted and may continue to result in legislative and
regulatory changes to key aspects of laws and
regulations affecting large banking and financial
institutions and in laws or regulations relating to
sustainability matters.
Enhanced Prudential Standards
The Federal Reserve has adopted rules (“SIFI Rules”)
to implement liquidity requirements, capital stress
testing and overall risk management requirements
affecting U.S. systemically important financial
institutions (“SIFIs”). BNY must comply with
enhanced liquidity and overall risk management
standards, which include maintenance of a buffer of
highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs
for 30 days. The liquidity buffer is in addition to the
rules regarding the LCR and NSFR, discussed below,
and is described by the Federal Reserve as being
“complementary” to these liquidity standards.
Capital Planning and Stress Testing
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions
The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from
its banks and other subsidiaries. Therefore, the
Parent primarily relies on dividends, interest,
distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries,
including extensions of credit from the IHC, to meet
its obligations, including its obligations with respect
to its securities, and to provide funds for share
repurchases and payment of common and preferred
dividends to its stockholders, to the extent declared
by the Board of Directors. Various federal and state
laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends
that may be paid to the Parent by our U.S. bank
subsidiaries without regulatory consent. If, in the
opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency, a
depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged
in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound
practice (which, depending on the financial condition
of the bank, could include the payment of dividends),
the regulator may require, after notice and hearing,
that the bank cease and desist from such practice.
The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC,” and together,
the “Agencies”) have indicated that the payment of
dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound
practice if the payment would reduce a depository
institution’s capital to an inadequate level. Moreover,
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended
(the “FDI Act”), an insured depository institution
(“IDI”) may not pay any dividends if the institution is
undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend
would cause the institution to become
undercapitalized. In addition, the Agencies have
issued policy statements which provide that FDICinsured depository institutions and their holding
companies should generally pay dividends only out of
their current operating earnings.
In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid
by our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including to the
Parent, is limited to the lesser of the amounts
calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an
“undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings
test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all
dividends declared and paid by the entity in any
calendar year exceeds the current year’s net income
combined with the retained net income of the two
preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior
regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test,
Supervision and Regulation
58 BNY
a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s
“undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net
profits that have not been paid out as dividends or
transferred to surplus). The ability of our U.S. bank
subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Parent may also
be affected by the capital adequacy standards
applicable to those subsidiaries, which include
minimum requirements and buffers.
There are also limitations specific to the IHC’s ability
to make distributions or extend credit to the Parent.
The IHC is not permitted to pay dividends to the
Parent if certain key capital or liquidity indicators are
breached. Additionally, if our projected financial
resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the
Parent becomes imminent, the committed lines of
credit provided by the IHC to the Parent will
automatically terminate, with all outstanding amounts
becoming due.
BNY’s capital distributions are subject to Federal
Reserve oversight. The major component of that
oversight is the Federal Reserve’s CCAR,
implementing its capital plan rule. That rule requires
BNY to submit annually a capital plan to the Federal
Reserve. We are also required to collect and report
certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the
Federal Reserve to monitor progress against the
annual capital plan.
On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized an
SCB rule, which made changes to the capital plan
rule. The SCB rule eliminated the quantitative
grounds for objection to a firm’s CCAR capital plan
and introduced an SCB that became part of quarterly
capital requirements of CCAR firms on Oct. 1, 2020.
The final rule replaced the 2.5% capital conservation
buffer with an SCB requirement for capital ratios
under the U.S. capital rules’ standardized approach
risk-weightings framework (“Standardized
Approach”) that is based on the largest projected
decrease in a firm’s CET1 ratio in the nine-quarter
CCAR supervisory severely adverse scenario plus
four quarters of planned common stock dividends as
percentage of RWAs. The SCB is subject to a 2.5%
floor. Each CCAR firm, including BNY, will be
notified of its SCB by August 31, and the SCB will
become effective on October 1 of the applicable
calendar year. In June 2024, the Federal Reserve
notified BNY that its preliminary SCB requirement
would remain at 2.5%, which equals the regulatory
floor. The SCB requirement was confirmed via an
announcement from the Federal Reserve in August
2024. The SCB rule requires that firms reduce their
planned capital actions if those distributions would
cause the firm to fall below applicable buffer
requirements based on the firm’s own baseline
scenario projections and allows firms to increase
certain planned capital distributions if they are
forecasted to be above capital buffer constraints. The
SCB rule also eliminates the requirement for prior
approval of capital distributions in excess of the
distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions do not cause a breach of the firm’s
capital ratios, including applicable buffers. In
addition, the SCB rule provides that a firm must
receive prior approval for any dividend, stock
repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a
capital distribution on a newly issued capital
instrument, if a firm is required to resubmit its capital
plan. In December 2024 and February 2025, the
Federal Reserve indicated that it intends to propose
changes to the stress test framework during 2025 and,
for the 2025 stress test, take steps to reduce the
volatility of results and to improve model
transparency. See “MD&A – Results of Operations –
Capital” for information about our share repurchase
program.
To the extent a banking organization’s capital buffer
is less than 100% of its applicable buffer
requirements, its distributions and discretionary
bonus payments are constrained by the amount of the
shortfall and its eligible retained income. Under the
final rule, eligible retained income is defined as the
greater of (i) a banking organization’s net income for
the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any
distributions and associated tax effects not already
reflected in net income, and (ii) the average of a
banking organization’s net income over the preceding
four quarters. The Federal Reserve made
corresponding changes to the definition of “eligible
retained income” in the TLAC buffer requirements.
For more information on TLAC, see “Total LossAbsorbing Capacity” below.
Regulatory Stress-Testing Requirements
In addition to the CCAR stress testing requirements,
Federal Reserve regulations also include
complementary Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests
(“DFAST”). The CCAR and DFAST requirements
substantially overlap, and the Federal Reserve
implements them at the BHC level on a coordinated
basis. Under these DFAST regulations, we are
required to undergo an annual regulatory stress test
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 59
conducted by the Federal Reserve. The BHC is
required to conduct an annual company-run stress
test. In addition, The Bank of New York Mellon is
required to conduct an annual company-run stress test
(although the bank is permitted to combine certain
reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with
the results of BNY). Results from our annual
company-run stress tests are reported to the
appropriate regulators and published.
Capital Requirements – Generally
As a BHC, we are subject to U.S. capital rules,
administered by the Federal Reserve. Our bank
subsidiaries are subject to similar capital
requirements administered by the Federal Reserve in
the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the
OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries,
BNY Mellon, National Association (“BNY Mellon,
N.A.”) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, National Association. These requirements
are intended to ensure that banking organizations
have adequate capital given the risk levels of their
assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
Notwithstanding the detailed U.S. capital rules, the
Agencies retain significant discretion to set higher
capital requirements for categories of BHCs or banks
or for an individual BHC or bank as warranted.
U.S. Capital Rules – Minimum Risk-Based Capital
Ratios and Capital Buffers
The U.S. capital rules require banking organizations
subject to the advanced approaches risk-weighting
framework (the “Advanced Approaches”), such as
BNY, to satisfy minimum risk-based capital ratios
using both the Standardized Approach and the
Advanced Approaches. See “MD&A – Results of
Operations – Capital” for details on these
requirements. In addition, for CCAR firms, these
minimum ratios are supplemented by (i) the SCB
(which, for BNY, is 2.5%, as noted), in the case of a
firm’s Standardized Approach capital ratios, and (ii) a
capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, in the case of a
firm’s Advanced Approaches capital ratios. The
capital conservation buffer can only be satisfied with
CET1 capital.
When systemic vulnerabilities are meaningfully
above normal, the SCB and capital conservation
buffer may be expanded up to an additional 2.5%
through the imposition of a countercyclical capital
buffer. For internationally active banks such as BNY,
the countercyclical capital buffer required threshold is
a weighted average of the countercyclical capital
buffers deployed in each of the jurisdictions in which
the bank has private sector credit exposures. The
Federal Reserve, in consultation with the OCC and
FDIC, has affirmed the current countercyclical capital
buffer level for U.S. exposures of 0% and noted that
any future modifications to the buffer would
generally be subject to a 12-month phase-in period.
Any countercyclical capital buffer required threshold
arising from exposures outside the U.S. will also
generally be subject to a 12-month phase-in period.
For G-SIBs like BNY, the U.S. capital rules’ buffers
are also supplemented by a G-SIB risk-based capital
surcharge, which is the higher of the surcharges
calculated under two methods (referred to as “method
1” and “method 2”). Method 1 is based on the BCBS
framework and considers a G-SIB’s size,
interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity,
substitutability and complexity. Method 2 uses
similar inputs but is calibrated to result in
significantly higher surcharges and replaces
substitutability with a measure of reliance on shortterm wholesale funding. The G-SIB surcharge
applicable to BNY for 2024 was 1.5%.
U.S. Capital Rules – Deductions from and
Adjustments to Capital Elements
The U.S. capital rules provide for a number of
deductions from and adjustments to CET1 capital.
These include, for example, providing that unrealized
gains and losses on all available-for-sale debt
securities may not be filtered out for regulatory
capital purposes, and the requirement that deferred
tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and
significant investments in non-consolidated financial
entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any
one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such
categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.
In addition, the Agencies adopted a final rule that
generally requires certain Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, including BNY, to deduct
from Tier 2 capital, subject to certain exceptions,
direct, indirect and synthetic exposures to covered
debt instruments, including TLAC instruments.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
60 BNY
U.S. Capital Rules – Advanced Approaches RiskBased Capital Rules
Under the U.S. capital rules’ Advanced Approaches
framework, credit risk-weightings are generally based
on risk-sensitive approaches that largely rely on the
use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas
under the Standardized Approach credit riskweightings are generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type
and asset class. BNY is required to comply with
Advanced Approaches reporting and public
disclosures. For purposes of determining whether we
meet minimum risk-based capital requirements under
the U.S. capital rules, our CET1 ratio, Tier 1 capital
ratio, and total capital ratio is the lower of each ratio
as calculated under the Standardized Approach and
under the Advanced Approaches framework (based
on currently applicable buffers).
U.S. Capital Rules – Standardized Approach
The Standardized Approach calculates risk-weighted
assets in the denominator of capital ratios using a
broad array of risk-weighting categories that are
intended to be risk sensitive. The risk-weights for the
Standardized Approach generally range from 0% to
1,250%. Higher risk-weights under the Standardized
Approach apply to a variety of exposures, including
certain securitization exposures, equity exposures,
claims on securities firms and exposures to
counterparties on OTC derivatives.
Securities finance transactions, including transactions
in which we serve as agent and provide securities
replacement indemnification to a securities lender, are
treated as repo-style transactions under the U.S.
capital rules. The rules do not permit a banking
organization to use a simple VaR approach to
calculate exposure amounts for repo-style
transactions or to use internal models to calculate the
exposure amount for the counterparty credit exposure
for repo-style transactions under the Standardized
Approach (although these methodologies are allowed
in the Advanced Approaches). Under the
Standardized Approach, a banking organization may
use a collateral haircut approach to recognize the
credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral
that secures a repo-style transaction, including an
agented securities lending transaction, among other
transactions. To apply the collateral haircut
approach, a banking organization must determine the
exposure amount and the relevant risk weight for the
counterparty and collateral posted.
U.S. Capital Rules – Standardized Approach for
Measuring Counterparty Credit Risk Exposures for
Derivatives
The Agencies jointly issued the Standardized
Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (“SA-CCR”)
in January 2020 amending the U.S. capital rules to
implement a modified approach for calculating the
exposure amount for derivative contracts. The final
rule also incorporates SA-CCR into the determination
of exposure amount of derivatives for total leverage
exposure under the SLR and the cleared transaction
framework under the U.S. capital rules. SA-CCR was
implemented in the first quarter of 2022.
U.S. Capital Rules – Leverage Ratios
The U.S. capital rules require a minimum 4%
leverage ratio for all banking organizations, as well as
a 3% Basel III-based SLR for Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, including BNY. Unlike the
Tier 1 leverage ratio, the SLR includes certain offbalance sheet exposures in the denominator, including
the potential future credit exposure of derivative
contracts and 10% of the notional amount of
unconditionally cancelable commitments.
The U.S. G-SIBs (including BNY) are subject to an
enhanced SLR, which requires us to maintain an SLR
of greater than 5% (composed of the current
minimum requirement of 3% plus a greater than 2%
buffer) and requires bank subsidiaries of those BHCs
to maintain at least a 6% SLR in order to qualify as
“well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action
regulations discussed below.
The Agencies adopted a final rule to exclude certain
central bank deposits from the total leverage
exposure, the SLR denominator, and related TLAC
and LTD measures of custody banks, including BNY
and The Bank of New York Mellon. Under the final
rule, qualifying central banks include a Federal
Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank or a central
bank of a member country of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”),
provided that an exposure to the OECD member
country receives a 0% risk-weighting and the
sovereign debt of such country is not, and has not
been, in default in the past five years. The central
bank deposit exclusion from the SLR denominator
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 61
equals the average daily balance over the applicable
quarter of all deposits placed with a qualifying central
bank up to an amount equal to the on-balance sheet
deposit liabilities that are linked to fiduciary or
custodial and safekeeping accounts.
BCBS Revisions to Components of Basel III and U.S.
Implementation
In December 2017, the BCBS released revisions to
Basel III intended to reduce variability of RWA and
improve the comparability of banks’ risk-based
capital ratios. In January 2019, the BCBS released
revised minimum capital requirements for market
risk.
On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and
the FDIC proposed for comment substantial revisions
to the capital requirements applicable to large
banking organizations and to banking organizations
with significant trading activity, including BNY, to
implement the international capital standards issued
by the BCBS. Large banking organizations would be
required to calculate risk-based capital ratios under
both a new Expanded Risk-based Approach
(replacing the current Advanced Approaches
framework) and the current Standardized Approach.
The proposal would replace existing models-based
Advanced Approaches for calculating RWA for credit
risk and operational risk with new standardized
approaches that are part of the Expanded Risk-based
Approach. The proposed Expanded Risk-based
Approach also includes a revised approach to market
risk.
The proposal would also indirectly impact several
other regulations, including the requirements for total
loss-absorbing capacity, long-term debt requirements,
and the surcharge for G-SIBs. The Federal Reserve
has indicated that it expects to work with the OCC
and FDIC in 2025 on a revised proposal.
Risk-Based Capital Surcharges for Global
Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies
On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed
amendments to its rule regarding risk-based capital
surcharges for G-SIBs, including BNY, to revise
certain systemic indicators and measures for G-SIB
surcharges. We are assessing the potential impact of
the proposal.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve imposes external TLAC and
related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, including
BNY, at the top-tier holding company.
U.S. G-SIBs are required to maintain a minimum
eligible external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18%
of RWAs plus a buffer (to be met using only CET1)
equal to the sum of 2.5% of RWAs, the G-SIB
surcharge calculated under method 1 and any
applicable countercyclical buffer; and (ii) 7.5% of
their total leverage exposure (the denominator of the
SLR) plus a buffer (to be met using only Tier 1
Capital) equal to 2%.
U.S. G-SIBs are also required to maintain minimum
external eligible LTD equal to the greater of (i) 6% of
RWAs plus the G-SIB surcharge (calculated using the
greater of method 1 and method 2), and (ii) 4.5% of
total leverage exposure. In order to be deemed
eligible LTD, debt instruments must, among other
requirements, be unsecured, not be structured notes,
and have a maturity of at least one year from the date
of issuance. In addition, LTD issued on or after Dec.
31, 2016 must (i) not have acceleration rights, other
than in the event of non-payment or the bankruptcy or
insolvency of the issuer and (ii) be governed by U.S.
law. However, debt issued by a U.S. G-SIB prior to
Dec. 31, 2016 is permanently grandfathered to the
extent these securities would be ineligible only due to
containing impermissible acceleration rights or being
governed by foreign law.
Further, the top-tier holding companies of U.S. GSIBs are not permitted to issue certain guarantees of
subsidiary liabilities, incur liabilities guaranteed by
subsidiaries, issue short-term debt to third parties, or
enter into derivatives and certain other financial
contracts with external counterparties. Certain
liabilities are capped at 5% of the value of the U.S. GSIB’s eligible external TLAC instruments.
On Aug. 29, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed for
comment amendments to the TLAC rule applicable to
U.S. G-SIBs, including BNY. The proposal would:
(i) require a $400,000 minimum denomination for
newly issued long-term debt of G-SIBs used to satisfy
TLAC and LTD requirements; (ii) allow only 50% of
the amount of eligible long-term debt with a maturity
of one year or more but less than two years to count
towards TLAC requirements; and (iii) exempt certain
agreements from the scope of the TLAC rule’s clean
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
62 BNY
holding company prohibitions with respect to
qualified financial contracts with third parties. We
are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed
rule.
Certain foreign jurisdictions impose internal TLAC
requirements on the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs. The European Union’s Capital Requirements
Regulation 2 (“EU CRR2”) requires EU material
subsidiaries of non-EU G-SIBs (including BNY) to
maintain a minimum level of internal loss absorbing
capacity; this requirement will continue under the
EU’s proposed Capital Requirements Regulation 3
(“EU CRR3”). The BNY SA/NV is considered an
EU material subsidiary for purposes of this regulation
and is, therefore, subject to an internal TLAC
requirement.
Prompt Corrective Action Regarding IDI Capital
Requirements
The FDI Act, as amended by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(“FDICIA”), requires the Agencies to take “prompt
corrective action” in respect of IDIs that do not meet
specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes
five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: “well
capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,”
“undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,”
and “critically undercapitalized.” The FDI Act
imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on
operations, management and capital distributions the
less capital the institution holds. While these
regulations apply only to banks, such as The Bank of
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., the
Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate
action against the parent BHC, such as the Parent,
based on the undercapitalized status of any banking
subsidiary. In certain circumstances, the Parent
would be required to guarantee the performance of
the capital restoration plan if one of our banking
subsidiaries were undercapitalized.
The Agencies’ prompt corrective action framework
contains “well capitalized” thresholds for IDIs.
Under these rules, an IDI must have the capital ratios
as detailed in the “Capital” disclosure in order to
satisfy the quantitative ratio requirements to be
deemed “well capitalized.”
Liquidity Standards – Basel III and U.S. Rules
BNY is subject to the U.S. LCR Rule, which is
designed to ensure that BNY and certain domestic
bank subsidiaries maintain an adequate level of
unencumbered HQLA equal to their expected net
cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under an acute
liquidity stress scenario. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the
Parent and its domestic bank subsidiaries were in
compliance with applicable LCR requirements.
The Agencies have issued a final NSFR rule that
implements a quantitative long-term liquidity
requirement applicable to large and internationally
active banking organizations, including BNY. Under
the final rule, BNY’s NSFR is expressed as a ratio of
its available stable funding to its required stable
funding amount, and BNY is required to maintain an
NSFR of 1.0. As of Dec. 31, 2024, BNY was in
compliance with the NSFR rule.
Separately, as noted above, the SIFI Rules impose
additional liquidity requirements for BHCs with $100
billion or more in total assets, including BNY,
including an independent review of liquidity risk
management; establishment of cash flow projections;
a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits;
liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios
and time horizons tailored to the specific products
and profile of the company; and maintenance of a
liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets
sufficient to meet projected net cash outflows over 30
days under a range of stress scenarios.
Volcker Rule
The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly
referred to as the “Volcker Rule” prohibit “banking
entities,” including BNY, from engaging in
proprietary trading and limit our sponsorship of, and
investments in, private equity and hedge funds
(“covered funds”), including our ability to own or
provide seed capital to covered funds. In addition,
the Volcker Rule restricts us from engaging in certain
transactions with covered funds (including, without
limitation, certain U.S. funds for which BNY acts as
both sponsor/manager and custodian). These
restrictions are subject to certain exceptions.
The restrictions concerning proprietary trading
contain limited exceptions for, among other things,
bona fide liquidity risk management and riskmitigating hedging activities, as well as certain
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 63
classes of exempted instruments, including
government securities. Ownership interests in
covered funds are generally limited to 3% of the total
number or value of the outstanding ownership
interests of any individual fund at any time more than
one year after the date of its establishment. The
aggregate value of all such ownership interests in
covered funds is limited to 3% of the banking
organization’s Tier 1 capital, and such interests are
subject to a deduction from its Tier 1 capital. The
2019 amendments to the Volcker Rule (discussed
below) remove the requirements that ownership
interests in third-party covered funds held under the
underwriting and market-making exemptions be
subject to the aggregate limit and capital deduction
but preserve these requirements for ownership
interests in covered funds sponsored or organized by
BNY.
The Volcker Rule regulations also require us to
develop and maintain a compliance program. In
2019, the Agencies, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) and the SEC modified the
regulations implementing the Volcker Rule. The
most impactful aspects of the revisions with respect
to BNY concern the compliance requirements
applicable to institutions with moderate exposure to
trading assets and trading liabilities, which are
institutions with less than $20 billion and more than
$1 billion of trading assets and trading liabilities.
Specifically, among other revisions, such “moderate
trading” banks are no longer required to file an annual
CEO attestation and quantitative metrics.
Furthermore, the comprehensive six-pillar
compliance program associated with the Volcker
Rule no longer applies to “moderate trading” banks;
rather, such banks are permitted to tailor their
compliance programs to the size and nature of their
activities. BNY is treated as a “moderate trading”
bank under the revised Volcker Rule. The final
revisions also clarified and amended certain
definitions, requirements and exemptions.
On June 25, 2020, a second set of amendments to the
Volcker Rule was released, which is principally
focused on the restrictions on banking entities’
investments in, sponsorship of, and other
relationships with covered funds. Generally, the
changes establish new exclusions from the covered
fund definition for certain types of investment
vehicles, modify the eligibility criteria for certain
existing exclusions, and clarify and modify other
provisions with respect to investment in, sponsoring
of and transactions with covered funds.
Derivatives Trading and Margining
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a
comprehensive regulatory structure on the OTC
derivatives markets in which BNY operates,
including requirements relating to the business
conduct of dealers, trade reporting, margin and
recordkeeping. Title VII also requires persons acting
as swap dealers, including The Bank of New York
Mellon, to register with the CFTC and become
subject to the CFTC’s supervisory, examination and
enforcement powers. Additionally, Title VII requires
persons acting as security-based swap dealers to
register with the SEC. The Bank of New York
Mellon is registered as a security-based swap dealer.
In addition, because BNY is subject to supervision by
the Federal Reserve, we must comply with the U.S.
prudential margin rules for variation and initial
margin with respect to its OTC swap transactions.
Furthermore, various BNY subsidiaries are also
subject to OTC derivatives regulation by local
authorities in Europe and Asia.
Single Counterparty Credit Limits
The Federal Reserve adopted a rule in June 2018
imposing single-counterparty credit limits (“SCCLs”)
on, among other organizations, domestic BHCs,
including BNY, that are G-SIBs. The SCCLs apply
to the credit exposure of a covered firm and all of its
subsidiaries to a single counterparty and all of its
affiliates and connected entities.
The rule established two primary credit exposure
limits: (i) a covered domestic BHC may not have
aggregate net credit exposure to any unaffiliated
counterparty in excess of 25% of its Tier 1 capital;
and (ii) a U.S. G-SIB is further prohibited from
having aggregate net credit exposure in excess of
15% of its Tier 1 capital to any “major
counterparty” (defined as a G-SIB or a non-bank
SIFI). The rule provides a cure period of 90 days (or,
with prior notice from the Federal Reserve, a longer
or shorter period) for breaches of the SCCL rule.
During the cure period, a company may not engage in
additional credit transactions with the particular
counterparty unless the covered company has
obtained a temporary credit exposure limit increase
from the Federal Reserve.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
64 BNY
Recovery and Resolution Planning
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, large domestic
financial institutions, such as BNY, are required to
submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the
FDIC a plan – referred to as the 165(d) resolution
plan – for their rapid and orderly resolution in the
event of material financial distress or failure. In
addition, certain large IDIs, such as The Bank of New
York Mellon, are required to submit periodically to
the FDIC a separate plan for resolution in the event of
the institution’s failure. The public portions of these
resolution plans are available on the Federal
Reserve’s and FDIC’s websites. BNY also maintains
a comprehensive recovery plan, which describes
actions it could take to seek to avoid failure if faced
with financial stress.
On June 20, 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule
amending its resolution planning rule applicable to
covered IDIs. The amended rule: (i) adjusts the
frequency of resolution plan submissions by IDIs
affiliated with a U.S. G-SIB, including The Bank of
New York Mellon, from a 3-year cycle to a 2-year
cycle; (ii) expands resolution plan content
requirements; (iii) requires IDIs to provide the FDIC
with notice within 45 days of certain “extraordinary
events”; and (iv) revises certain definitions to be
more consistent with similar concepts and approaches
under the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule became
effective on Oct. 1, 2024.
In 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued a final
rule modifying certain requirements for the 165(d)
resolution plan. The final rule requires U.S. G-SIBs,
such as BNY, to file alternating full and more limited,
targeted resolution plans every two years. The final
rule does not materially modify the components or
informational requirements of full resolution plans.
BNY submitted a full resolution plan dated July 1,
2023. The Federal Reserve and FDIC found no
deficiencies or shortcomings in BNY’s 2023
resolution plan submission.
If the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly determine
that our 165(d) resolution plan is not credible and we
fail to address the deficiencies in a timely manner, the
FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose
more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity
requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities
or operations. If we continue to fail to adequately
remedy any deficiencies, we could be required to
divest assets or operations that the regulators
determine necessary to facilitate our orderly
resolution.
The resolution strategy set out in our 165(d)
resolution plan is a single point of entry strategy,
whereby certain key operating subsidiaries would be
provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to
operate in the event of material financial stress or
failure, and only our parent holding company would
file for bankruptcy. In connection with our single
point of entry resolution strategy, we have established
the IHC to facilitate the provision of capital and
liquidity resources to certain key subsidiaries in the
event of material financial distress or failure. In
addition, we have a binding support agreement in
place that requires the IHC to provide that support.
The support agreement required the Parent to transfer
its intercompany loans and most of its cash to the
IHC and requires the Parent to continue to transfer
cash and other liquid financial assets to the IHC on an
ongoing basis.
BNY and the other U.S. G-SIBs are also subject to
heightened supervisory expectations for recovery and
resolution preparedness under Federal Reserve rules
and guidance. The Federal Reserve incorporates
reviews of our capabilities in respect of recovery and
resolution preparedness as part of its ongoing
supervision of BNY.
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the
UK, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, as
amended by the Bank Resolution and Recovery
Directive II (“BRRD”), provides the legal framework
for recovery and resolution planning, including a set
of harmonized powers to resolve or implement
recovery of in-scope institutions, such as EEA and
UK subsidiaries of third country banks. The UK
transposed the BRRD into local legislation and
regulation before the UK exit from the EU on Dec.
31, 2020. Existing EU law that was in force and
applicable in the UK on Dec. 31, 2020, continues to
be effective under the UK regulatory framework as
“retained EU law.”
The BRRD, as implemented in local law, gives
relevant EEA and UK regulators various powers,
including: (i) powers to intervene pre-resolution to
require an institution to take remedial steps to avoid
the need for resolution; (ii) resolution tools and
powers to facilitate the resolution of failing entities,
such as the power to “bail-in” the debt of an
institution (including certain deposit obligations); (iii)
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 65
the power to require a firm to change its structure to
remove impediments to resolvability; and (iv) powers
to require in-scope institutions to prepare recovery
plans. Under the BRRD, resolution authorities (rather
than the institutions themselves) are responsible for
drawing up resolution plans based on information
provided by relevant institutions.
Under applicable rules, in-scope institutions are
required to maintain a minimum requirement for their
own funds (defined as regulatory capital) and eligible
liabilities (“MREL”) that can be written down or
bailed-in to absorb losses. MREL is set on a case-bycase basis for each institution and is applicable to
certain EU and UK domiciled credit institutions and
certain other firms subject to recovery and resolution
planning BNY SA/NV is subject to MREL.
Rules on Resolution Stays for Qualified Financial
Contracts
The Agencies’ regulations require U.S. G-SIBs (and
their subsidiaries and controlled entities) and the U.S.
operations of foreign G-SIBs to amend their covered
qualified financial contracts (“QFCs”), thereby
facilitating the application of U.S. special resolution
regimes as necessary.
The regulations allow these G-SIBs to comply by
amending covered QFCs (with the consent of relevant
counterparties) using the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) 2018 U.S.
Resolution Stay Protocol, ISDA 2015 Universal Stay
Protocol or by executing appropriate bilateral
amendments to the covered QFCs. BNY entities
which have been confirmed to engage in covered
QFC activities have adhered to the Protocol and,
where necessary, have executed bilateral amendments
to cover QFCs.
Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a
Bank Holding Company; Orderly Liquidation
Authority
Under the FDI Act, if the FDIC is appointed as
conservator or receiver for an IDI, such as The Bank
of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., upon its
insolvency or in certain other circumstances, the
FDIC has the power to:
• Transfer any of the depository institution’s assets
and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly
formed “bridge” bank without the approval of the
depository institution’s creditors;
• Enforce the terms of the depository institution’s
contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to
any provisions triggered by the appointment of
the FDIC in that capacity; or
• Repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to
which the depository institution is a party, the
performance of which is determined by the FDIC
to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or
repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC
to promote the orderly administration of the
depository institution.
In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders
of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for
administrative expenses against an IDI would be
afforded a priority over other general unsecured
claims, including claims of debt holders, in the
“liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution
by any receiver. As a result, regardless of whether
the FDIC repudiates any debt obligations of The
Bank of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., the
debt holders would be treated differently from, and
could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the
depositors of the bank.
The Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime
(known as the “orderly liquidation authority”)
applicable to domestic systemically important
financial companies that are not IDIs, including
BHCs, such as the Parent, and their non-bank
affiliates. Under the orderly liquidation authority, the
FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the
systemically important institution, and its failed nonbank subsidiaries, for purposes of liquidating the
entity if, among other conditions, it is determined that
the institution is in default or in danger of default and
the failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S.
financial system.
In liquidations of failing financial institutions where
the Dodd-Frank orderly liquidation authority applies,
the orderly liquidation authority supplants the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code and sets forth the powers of the
FDIC as receiver and the rights and obligations of
creditors and other parties who have dealt with the
financial institution. The powers of the FDIC as
receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were
based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for IDIs
under the FDI Act. However, the provisions
governing the rights of creditors under the orderly
liquidation authority were modified in certain
respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of
creditors’ claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
66 BNY
Nonetheless, substantial differences in the rights of
creditors exist between these two regimes, including
the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of
creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an
administrative claims procedure to determine
creditors’ claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure
utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of
the FDIC to transfer assets or liabilities of the
institution to a third party or a “bridge” entity.
Depositor Preference in Bank Resolutions
The FDIC applies a priority regime (“depositor
preference”) for the distribution of receivership assets
of a failed bank. Under the depositor preference
regime, when a U.S. bank fails, the claims of a
receiver of an IDI for administrative expenses and
claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including
foreign deposits that are payable in the U.S. as well as
in a foreign branch of the depository institution) are
afforded priority over claims of other unsecured
creditors of the institution, including depositors in
non-U.S. branches. As a result, such depositors could
receive, if anything, substantially less than the
depositors in U.S. offices of the depository
institution.
FDIC Deposit Insurance
Our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including The Bank of
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., accept
deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC
insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit
for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000
per depositor at each insured bank. Under the FDI
Act, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the
FDIC upon a finding that the IDI has engaged in
unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or
unsound condition to continue operations or has
violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order,
condition imposed by the FDIC, or written agreement
between the IDI and the FDIC.
The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) is
funded by assessments on IDIs. The FDIC assesses
DIF premiums based on an IDI’s average
consolidated total assets, less the average tangible
equity of the IDI during the assessment period. For
larger institutions, such as The Bank of New York
Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., assessments are
determined based on CAMELS ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to calculate the
assessment rate, which is subject to adjustments by
the FDIC, and the assessment base.
Under the FDIC’s regulations, a custody bank,
including The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY
Mellon, N.A., may deduct from its assessment base
100% of cash and balances due from depository
institutions, securities, federal funds sold, and
securities purchased under agreement to resell with a
Standardized Approach risk-weight of 0% and may
deduct 50% of such asset types with a Standardized
Approach risk-weight of greater than 0% and up to
and including 20%. This assessment base deduction
may not exceed the average value of deposits that are
classified as transaction accounts and are identified
by the bank as being directly linked to a fiduciary or
custodial and safekeeping account.
Following the bank failures in March 2023, the FDIC
announced that, as required by the FDI Act, any
losses to the DIF to support uninsured depositors
would be recovered by a special assessment
prescribed through regulation. Under the FDI Act,
the FDIC has discretion with respect to the design and
timeframe for any special assessment, which may be
on IDIs, depository institution holding companies
(with the concurrence of the Treasury Secretary), or
both, as the FDIC determines to be appropriate. The
FDIC may consider the types of entities that benefit
from the action taken, economic conditions, the
effects on the industry, and such other factors as the
FDIC deems appropriate.
On Nov. 16, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule,
effective April 1, 2024, implementing a special
assessment on IDIs to recover losses to the DIF
associated with the 2023 closures of Silicon Valley
Bank and Signature Bank. Under the rule, the FDIC
will collect from each IDI a special assessment, based
on the IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits (excluding
the first $5 billion of estimated uninsured deposits
applied at the banking organization level) as of Dec.
31, 2022, during an initial special assessment period
of eight quarters that began in the first quarter of
2024. The special assessment is subject to periodic
adjustment by the FDIC, including early cessation,
extension or a potential one-time final special
assessment for any shortfall to the DIF. We have
recorded accruals and related adjustments for the
estimate of the special assessment to noninterest
expense starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 and
throughout 2024.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 67
BHC as Source of Strength and Liability of
Commonly Controlled Depository Institutions
The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to act as a source
of financial and managerial strength to their bank
subsidiaries. BNY has a statutory obligation to
commit resources to its bank subsidiaries in times of
financial distress. In addition, any loans by BNY to
its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of
payment to depositors and to certain other
indebtedness of its banks. In the event of a BHC’s
reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, any
commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulator
to maintain the capital of a subsidiary IDI will be
deemed assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and
entitled to priority of payment of the unsecured claim
resulting from such commitment. Further, in certain
circumstances, BNY’s IDI subsidiaries could be held
liable for losses incurred by another BNY IDI
subsidiary. In the event of impairment of the capital
stock of one of BNY’s national bank subsidiaries or
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY, as the banks’
stockholder, could be required to pay such deficiency.
Bank Transactions with Non-bank Affiliates
Transactions between BNY’s banking subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the Parent and its non-bank
subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other, are subject to
certain restrictions, limitations and requirements,
which include limits on the types and amounts of
transactions (including extensions of credit and asset
purchases by our banking subsidiaries) that may take
place and generally require those transactions to be in
good faith, at arm’s-length, and on market terms. In
general, extensions of credit by a BNY banking
subsidiary to any non-bank affiliate, including the
Parent, must be secured by designated amounts of
specified collateral and are limited in the aggregate to
10% of the relevant bank’s capital and surplus for
transactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the
relevant bank’s capital and surplus for transactions
with all affiliates. There are also limitations on
affiliate credit exposures arising from derivative
transactions and securities lending and borrowing
transactions.
Acquisitions/Transactions by Banks or BHCs
Federal and state laws impose notice and approval
requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving
depository institutions or BHCs. The Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended by the GrammLeach-Bliley Act and by the Dodd-Frank Act (the
“BHC Act”), requires the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve for the direct or indirect acquisition
by a BHC of more than 5% of any class of the voting
shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a
commercial bank, savings and loan association or
BHC. In reviewing bank acquisition and merger
applications, the bank regulatory authorities will
consider, among other things, the competitive effect
of the transaction, financial and managerial resources,
including the capital position of the combined
organization, convenience and needs of the
community factors, including the applicant’s record
under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the
“CRA”), the effectiveness of the subject
organizations in combating money laundering
activities and the risk to the stability of the U.S.
banking or financial system. In addition, prior
Federal Reserve approval would be required for BNY
to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of
any voting shares of a company with assets of $10
billion or more that is engaged in activities that are
“financial in nature.”
Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) and the USA
PATRIOT Act
A major focus of governmental policy on financial
institutions has been aimed at combating money
laundering and terrorist financing. The USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains numerous AML
requirements for financial institutions that are
applicable to BNY’s bank, broker-dealer and
investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and
private investment companies advised or sponsored
by our subsidiaries. Those regulations impose
obligations on financial institutions to maintain a
broad AML program that includes internal controls,
independent testing, compliance management
personnel, training, and customer due diligence
processes, as well as appropriate policies, procedures
and controls to detect, prevent and report money
laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious
activity, and to verify the identity of their customers.
Certain of those regulations impose specific due
diligence requirements on financial institutions that
maintain correspondent or private banking
relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or
persons.
The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”),
which amends the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), was
enacted to comprehensively reform and modernize
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
68 BNY
U.S. AML laws. Among other things, the AMLA
codifies a risk-based approach to AML compliance
for financial institutions; requires the development of
standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for
evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA
compliance; and expands enforcement- and
investigation-related authority, including a significant
expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA
violations and instituting BSA whistleblower
incentives and protections. The AMLA contains
many statutory provisions that require additional
rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the
rulemaking process has begun for several of these
provisions. In June 2021, the first government-wide
priorities for anti-money laundering and countering
the financing of terrorism (“AML/CFT Priorities”)
were published. These AML/CFT Priorities will need
to be incorporated into banks’ risk-based BSA
compliance programs after completion of the
rulemaking process and on the effective date of the
final regulations. The impact of the AMLA will
depend on, among other things, the completion of the
rulemaking process and the issuing of implementation
guidance.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”)
FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, issued rules under the BSA that apply to
covered financial institutions, including The Bank of
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., setting
forth five pillars of an effective AML program:
development of internal policies, procedures and
related controls; designation of a compliance officer;
a thorough and ongoing training program;
independent review for compliance; and customer
due diligence (“CDD”). CDD requires a covered
financial institution to implement and maintain riskbased procedures for conducting CDD that include
the identification and verification of any beneficial
owner(s) of each legal entity customer at the time a
new account is opened.
Bank Secrecy Act Extended to Investment Advisers
On Aug. 28, 2024, FinCEN adopted a final rule
requiring certain investment advisers to establish antimoney laundering/countering the financing of
terrorism (“AML/CFT”) programs pursuant to the
BSA and to monitor for, and report, suspicious
activity and currency transactions to FinCEN.
Investment advisers will be required to apply their
AML/CFT programs to all advisory services provided
to all customers, except that they will be permitted to
exclude mutual funds, certain bank- and trust
company-sponsored collective investment funds, and
other investment advisers subject to the rule. Among
other requirements, the AML/CFT program must (i)
be risk-based, (ii) be reasonably designed to prevent
the investment adviser from being used for money
laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit finance
activities and to achieve compliance with applicable
provisions of the BSA and regulations thereunder,
(iii) provide for independent compliance testing, and
(iv) designate responsible persons and ongoing
training. Investment advisers must comply with the
Rule by Jan. 1, 2026. BNY has evaluated the final
rule and is implementing a program designed to meet
the applicable regulatory requirements.
NYSDFS Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism
Regulations
The New York State Department of Financial
Services (“NYSDFS”) issued regulations requiring
regulated institutions, including The Bank of New
York Mellon, to maintain a transaction monitoring
program to monitor transactions for potential BSA
and AML violations and suspicious activity reporting,
and a watch list filtering program to interdict
transactions prohibited by applicable sanctions
programs.
The regulations require a regulated institution to
maintain programs to monitor and filter transactions
for potential BSA and AML violations and prevent
transactions with sanctioned entities. The regulations
also require institutions to submit annually a board
resolution or senior officer compliance finding
confirming steps taken to ascertain compliance with
the regulation.
Privacy and Data Protection
The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including
BNY, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial
information of consumer customers to third parties
for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless
customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the
disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts
information sharing among affiliates for marketing
purposes.
In the EU, privacy law is primarily regulated by the
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 69
GDPR contains enhanced compliance obligations and
penalties for non-compliance.
EU Artificial Intelligence Act
On July 12, 2024, the EU’s Regulation on Artificial
Intelligence (“AI Act”) was published in the Official
Journal of the EU and came into force on Aug. 1,
2024. The AI Act will apply extraterritorially,
impacting both EU and non-EU entities, and will
impact BNY. The AI Act creates a pan-EU
regulatory framework to manage the risks associated
with the use of artificial intelligence, including with
respect to financial services. The AI Act requires
categorization of AI systems into four risk levels
depending on their potential to harm individuals or
society (unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and
minimal risk) and imposes obligations depending on
the risk categorization, which may include data
governance, documentation and recordkeeping,
human oversight, testing, cybersecurity, disclosure,
regulatory notification or reporting, or training. In
addition, the AI Act prohibits AI that pose
unacceptable risks that are abusive or contradict EU
values, including AI that may be manipulative,
exploitive, or discriminatory. The individual
provisions of the AI Act apply on a rolling basis from
Feb. 2, 2025 to Aug. 2, 2027. BNY has evaluated the
impact of the AI Act and has established an
implementation program designed to operationalize
the regulatory requirements applicable to BNY within
required time frames.
SEC Conflicts of Interest Rule for Use of Artificial
Intelligence by Broker-Dealers and Investment
Advisers
On July 26, 2023, the SEC proposed new rules
intended to address certain conflicts of interest
associated with the use of “Covered Technology” by
broker-dealers and investment advisers (“Firms”) in
investor interactions (“Proposed AI Rules”). Covered
Technology is generally described as applying to
“artificial intelligence” or “AI” and is broadly defined
under the Proposed AI Rules to include the use of
analytical, technological, or computational functions,
algorithms, models, correlation matrices, or similar
methods or processes that optimize for, predict,
guide, forecast, or direct investment-related behaviors
or outcomes of an investor. If adopted, the Proposed
AI Rules would: (i) generally apply when a Firm uses
a Covered Technology in engaging or communicating
with an investor, including by exercising discretion
with respect to an investor’s account, providing an
investor with information, or soliciting an investor
and (ii) require Firms to (among other things) identify
conflicts of interests when using Covered Technology
in interactions with investors, and adopt policies and
procedures to eliminate or neutralize those conflicts
of interest. We continue to evaluate the potential
impact of the proposed rules.
Cybersecurity Regulation
The NYSDFS requires financial institutions regulated
by NYSDFS, including The Bank of New York
Mellon, to establish a cybersecurity program, adopt a
written cybersecurity policy, designate a chief
information security officer, address artificial
intelligence risks related to cybersecurity, and have
policies and procedures in place to ensure the security
of information systems and non-public information
accessible to, or held by, third parties. The NYSDFS
rule also includes a variety of other requirements to
protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability
of information systems, including the annual delivery
of a certificate of compliance.
The Agencies have adopted a final rule imposing
notification requirements for significant computersecurity incidents on banking organizations. Under
the final rule, a BHC, state member bank or national
bank, including the Parent, The Bank of New York
Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., is required to notify
the Federal Reserve or OCC, as applicable, within 36
hours after a computer-security incident that could: (i)
result in the banking organization’s inability to
deliver services to a material portion of its customer
base, (ii) disrupt the banking organization’s lines of
businesses the failure of which would result in
material losses, or (iii) disrupt operations the failure
of which would threaten the financial stability of the
U.S.
On July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted rules, effective on
Sept. 5, 2023, requiring public companies, including
the Parent, to disclose material cybersecurity
incidents and details regarding their cybersecurity
risk management, strategy and governance. Under
the rules, public companies must disclose material
cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K. Disclosure of
material incidents generally is due within four
business days after a public company determines that
a cybersecurity incident is material. On an annual
basis, public companies must describe in their annual
report on Form 10-K their processes for assessing,
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
70 BNY
identifying, and managing, and management’s role
and expertise in assessing and managing, material
cybersecurity risks; whether any cybersecurity risks
have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
material affect the company; and the board of
directors’ oversight of cybersecurity risks.
On March 15, 2023, the SEC proposed a new rule
regarding cybersecurity risk management for entities
including broker-dealers, security-based swap
dealers, and transfer agents. The proposed rule would
require such entities to maintain written policies and
procedures to address their cybersecurity risk,
immediately notify the SEC of significant
cybersecurity incidents, and publicly disclose
descriptions of their cybersecurity risks and
significant cybersecurity incidents.
In addition, on March 15, 2023, the SEC proposed
amendments to Regulation S-P, including a
requirement for broker-dealers, investment
companies, RIAs, and transfer agents to adopt written
policies and procedures for an incident response
program with respect to unauthorized access to or use
of customer information. The proposal would require
these entities to notify individuals whose sensitive
customer information was accessed or used without
authorization not later than 30 days after becoming
aware that the information was compromised. BNY
is evaluating the potential impact of the proposals.
SEC Amendments to Regulation S-P for Safeguarding
of Customer Information
On May 16, 2024, the SEC adopted amendments (the
“S-P Amendments”) to Regulation S-P, which
governs the safeguarding, treatment and disposal of
customer records and information by certain financial
institutions, to enhance the protection of customer
financial information and establish a federal
minimum standard for data breach notifications to
affected individuals by brokers, dealers, investment
companies, registered investment advisers and
transfer agents (“S-P covered institutions”). The S-P
Amendments: (i) extend certain requirements of
Regulation S-P to transfer agents registered with the
SEC or another appropriate regulatory agency; (ii)
require S-P covered institutions to develop,
implement, and maintain written policies and
procedures for an incident response program that is
reasonably designed to detect, respond to, and recover
from unauthorized access to or use of customer
information; (iii) set forth a data breach notification
requirement that requires S-P covered institutions to
notify affected individuals whose customer
information was, or is reasonably likely to have been,
accessed or used without authorization (subject to
certain exceptions) within 30 days after the S-P
covered institution becomes aware that unauthorized
access to or use of customer information has, or is
reasonably likely to have, occurred; (iv) broaden the
group of customers whose information is protected;
(v) address the use of service providers by S-P
covered institutions; and (vi) codify an existing
statutory exemption to the requirement to provide
annual privacy notices to customers. The S-P
Amendments are effective as of Aug. 2, 2024 and
BNY will have 18 months to come into compliance.
BNY has evaluated the S-P Amendments and is
implementing a program designed to meet the
applicable regulatory requirements.
Sustainability
The SEC adopted a final rule, on March 6, 2024,
requiring registrants, including BNY, to disclose
material climate-related information in registration
statements and periodic reports; however, the final
rule is currently subject to multiple legal challenges
and, on April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily issued an
order staying the final rule pending the completion of
judicial review of the legal challenges. In addition,
the SEC’s May 2022 proposed rule and form
amendments under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 remains pending
and would require certain registered investment funds
and certain investment advisers to provide enhanced
disclosures regarding environmental, social, and
governance factors considered. Implementation of
the SEC rules is currently uncertain.
A number of states have proposed or enacted laws
and regulations addressing climate disclosure. For
example, California enacted three statutes imposing
extensive new climate-related disclosure obligations
on certain companies doing business in California,
which became effective on Jan. 1, 2024, including the
Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (as
updated in 2024, “SB 253”), which requires annual
disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions beginning in
2026, and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (as
updated in 2024, “SB 261”), which requires
publication of biennial reports disclosing climaterelated financial risks and the measures adopted to
mitigate the disclosed risks beginning on Jan. 1,
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 71
2026. Conversely, certain states have enacted or
implemented, or have proposed to enact or
implement, statutes, regulations or policies that
prohibit financial institutions from denying or
canceling products or services to a person, or
otherwise discriminating against a person in making
available products or services, on the basis of social
credit scores and certain other sustainability factors.
In Europe, EU entities in-scope for the Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will
soon be subject to new requirements to disclose
information about impacts, risks, and opportunities
related to sustainability matters. Five EU subsidiaries
of BNY are currently subject to these requirements,
with BNY SA/NV required to report in 2025 and the
remaining four subsidiaries currently scheduled to
report in 2026. However, on Feb. 26, 2025, the
European Commission published proposals aimed at
simplifying the EU sustainability rules (the “Omnibus
Package”). Under the Omnibus Package, only
companies with more than 1,000 employees and
either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance
sheet total above EUR 25 million would be obliged to
report under CSRD. In addition, there is a proposal
to postpone the application of all reporting
requirements for companies currently in scope of
CSRD and which are required to report as of 2026
and 2027 until 2028.
The Omnibus Package also puts forward proposals
that would amend the obligations under the current
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive
(“CSDDD”). CSDDD entered into force in the EU
on July 25, 2024, and applies to large EU companies
and non-EU companies with significant EU activity.
Under the current legislative text, CSDDD will apply
on a phased-in basis, starting three years after
CSDDD’s entry into force, dependent on a
company’s number of employees and net worldwide
or EU turnover. In-scope companies are required to
comply with due diligence obligations for their
operations and for their upstream chains of activities
and to adopt a transition plan for climate change
mitigation. The Omnibus Package introduces
proposals aimed at simplifying aspects of CSDDD’s
sustainability due diligence requirements and
postponing the first phase of their application
(covering the largest companies) to July 26, 2028.
If the proposals put forward by the European
Commission under the Omnibus Package are
implemented, this may have a direct impact on the
obligations of the BNY entities currently in scope of
CSRD and CSDDD.
Our UK supervisory authorities have adopted new
disclosure requirements and supervisory expectations
that currently apply or will apply to our subsidiaries
and branches that are regulated by the UK Financial
Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the UK Prudential
Regulation Authority (“PRA”). For example, since
the end of 2021 our PRA regulated branch and
banking subsidiary have been subject to the PRA’s
supervisory expectations for the management of
climate-related financial risks, including as regards
governance, risk management, scenario analysis and
disclosure. Further, new FCA rules on antigreenwashing will require that from May 31, 2024,
any sustainability-related claims made about our
products and services by our FCA regulated entities
are consistent with the sustainability characteristics of
such products or services and are fair, clear and not
misleading.
Published guidance from our regulators globally,
including the Agencies and NYSDFS, has primarily
focused on climate-related financial risk
management, including with respect to, among other
things, governance, policies and procedures, strategy,
risk management, data and reporting, and scenario
analysis. As the global regulatory framework for
climate and sustainability-related disclosure and risk
management practices continues to evolve, including
potential expansion, contraction or streamlining of
regulations, we continue to monitor developments
and evaluate the potential impacts on our business
and operations.
Incentive Compensation Arrangements
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires six
federal regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or
guidelines regarding incentive-based compensation
practices at certain financial institutions, including
BNY. The timeframe for a joint proposal and
implementation of a final rule, if any, is currently
unknown.
Regulated Entities of BNY and Ancillary Regulatory
Requirements
BHC and Bank Entities
BNY is registered as an FHC under the BHC Act and
subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve. In
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
72 BNY
general, the BHC Act limits an FHC’s business
activities to banking, managing or controlling banks,
performing certain servicing activities for
subsidiaries, engaging in activities incidental to
banking, and engaging in any activity, or acquiring
and retaining the shares of any company engaged in
any activity, that is either financial in nature or
complementary to a financial activity and does not
pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of
depository institutions or the financial system
generally.
A BHC’s ability to maintain FHC status is dependent
on: (i) its U.S. IDI subsidiaries qualifying on an
ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well
managed” under the prompt corrective action
regulations of the appropriate regulatory agency
(discussed above under “Prompt Corrective Action”);
(ii) the BHC itself qualifying on an ongoing basis as
“well capitalized” and “well managed” under
applicable Federal Reserve regulations; and (iii) its
U.S. IDI subsidiaries’ continuing to maintain at least
a “satisfactory” rating under the CRA.
The Federal Reserve’s rating system for the
supervision of large financial institutions (“LFIs”)
applies to, among other entities, all BHCs with total
consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including
BNY. The LFI rating system includes a four-level
rating scale and three component ratings. The four
levels are: Broadly Meets Expectations; Conditionally
Meets Expectations; Deficient-1; and Deficient-2.
The component ratings are assigned for: Capital
Planning and Positions; Liquidity Risk Management
and Positions; and Governance and Controls. A firm
must be rated “Broadly Meets Expectations” or
“Conditionally Meets Expectations” for each of its
component ratings to be considered “well managed”
in accordance with various statutes and regulations
that permit additional activities, prescribe expedited
procedures or provide other benefits for “well
managed” firms. See “U.S. Capital Rules – Leverage
Ratios” and “Prompt Corrective Action Regarding
IDI Capital Requirements” above for details on
qualifying as “well capitalized.”
An FHC that does not continue to meet all the
requirements for FHC status will, depending on
which requirements it fails to meet, lose the ability to
undertake new activities, continue current activities,
or make acquisitions that are not generally
permissible for BHCs without FHC status. As of
Dec. 31, 2024, BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries
were “well capitalized” based on the ratios and rules
applicable to them.
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY’s largest
banking subsidiary, is a New York state-chartered
bank, a member of the Federal Reserve and subject to
regulation, supervision and examination by the
Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the NYSDFS. BNY’s
national bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, N.A. and
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,
National Association, are chartered as national
banking associations subject to primary regulation,
supervision and examination by the OCC.
On Aug. 8, 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a
Supervision and Regulation Letter (SR 23-7)
announcing the establishment of its Novel Activities
Supervision Program (“NASP”) to complement its
existing supervision and oversight of supervised
banking organizations, including BNY. The NASP
encompasses risk-based monitoring and examination
and focuses on, novel activities related to cryptoassets, distributed ledger technology, and complex,
technology-driven partnerships with non-bank
providers of banking products and services to
customers. The Federal Reserve also evaluates, under
the NASP, the concentrated provision of banking
services to crypto-asset-related entities and fintechs.
Securities Markets
We operate a number of broker-dealers that engage in
securities underwriting and other broker-dealer
activities in the U.S. These companies are SECregistered broker-dealers and members of Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), a
securities industry self-regulatory organization.
BNY’s non-bank subsidiaries engaged in securitiesrelated activities are regulated by supervisory
agencies in the countries in which they conduct
business, where required.
Certain of BNY’s public finance and advisory
activities are regulated by the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board and the relevant BNY affiliates
have registered with the SEC, as required under the
SEC’s Municipal Advisors Rule if they provide
advice to municipal entities or certain other persons
on the issuance of municipal securities, or about
certain investment strategies or municipal derivatives.
Certain of BNY’s subsidiaries are registered with the
CFTC as commodity pool operators, introducing
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 73
brokers and/or commodity trading advisors and, as
such, are subject to CFTC regulation. The Bank of
New York Mellon is registered as a swap dealer (as
defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) with the CFTC and is
a member of the National Futures Association
(“NFA”) in that same capacity. As a swap dealer,
The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
regulation, supervision and examination by the CFTC
and NFA.
On Dec. 13, 2023, the SEC approved a final rule
requiring covered clearing agencies that clear
transactions in U.S. Treasuries (“CCPs”) to establish
policies requiring their direct participants, including
BNY, to submit for clearing all “eligible secondary
market transactions” in U.S. Treasuries to which such
direct participant is a counterparty, which include all
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements
(“repo”) collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and certain
cash transactions in U.S. Treasuries engaging specific
institutions, including inter-dealer brokers, registered
broker-dealers, government securities brokers and
government securities dealers. Eligible secondary
market transactions, however, exclude (i) repo
transactions with affiliates (under certain conditions),
central banks, sovereign entities, international
financial institutions, natural persons and CCPs and
(ii) securities lending transactions involving U.S.
Treasuries. The compliance date for all eligible cash
market transactions is Dec. 31, 2026 and the
compliance date for all eligible repo market
transactions is June 30, 2027.
SEC Rules Impacting Investment and Wealth
Management
SEC regulations impose requirements on mutual
funds, exchange-traded funds and other registered
investment companies (“RICs”) under the 1940 Act.
Among other things, these rules require mutual funds
(other than money market funds) to provide portfoliowide and position-level holdings data to the SEC on a
monthly basis.
The regulations also impose liquidity risk
management requirements that are intended to reduce
the risk that funds will not be able to meet
shareholder redemptions and to minimize the impact
of redemptions on remaining shareholders.
On July 12, 2023, the SEC adopted amendments to
rules that govern money market funds. The
amendments became effective Oct. 2, 2023, with
tiered compliance dates. The amendments include,
among other things: (i) a mandatory liquidity fee for
institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt
money market funds, which will apply when a fund
experiences daily net redemptions that exceed 5% of
net assets (effective Oct. 2, 2023); (ii) maintenance of
a fund board’s ability to impose liquidity fees (not to
exceed 2% of the value of the shares redeemed) on a
discretionary basis for non-government money
market funds (effective April 2, 2024); (iii)
substantially increasing the required minimum levels
of daily and weekly liquid assets for all money
market funds from 10% and 30%, to 25% and 50%,
respectively (effective April 2, 2024); and (iv)
removal of a money market fund’s ability to impose
temporary “gates” to suspend redemptions in order to
prevent dilution and remove the link between a
money market fund’s liquidity level and its
imposition of liquidity fees (effective Oct. 2, 2023).
On Sept. 20, 2023, the SEC adopted amendments
expanding the scope of terms that the SEC considers
materially deceptive and misleading in a fund’s name
without a corresponding policy and related controls to
invest at least 80% of the fund’s net asset value (plus
certain borrowings) in the manner suggested by the
fund’s name (“80% Policy”), including names that
reference “growth” or “value,” or a name indicating
that investment decisions incorporate any
environmental, social and governance factors. The
amendments became effective Dec. 10, 2023 and
fund groups will have either 24 months or 30 months
to come into compliance, depending upon their net
asset size.
On Oct. 26, 2022, the SEC proposed for comment
new rules to prohibit RIAs from outsourcing certain
services and functions without first meeting certain
threshold requirements, including conducting due
diligence, and thereafter requiring ongoing
monitoring of the service providers. The proposal
would apply to RIAs that outsource select “covered
functions,” which include those services or functions
that are necessary for providing advisory services in
compliance with federal securities laws and that, if
not performed or performed negligently, would result
in potential harm to clients. The proposal would
further require RIAs to conduct due diligence and
monitoring for all third-party recordkeepers and
obtain reasonable assurances that the recordkeepers
will meet certain standards. Finally, it would require
RIAs to maintain books and records related to the
new rule’s oversight obligations and to report censusSupervision and Regulation (continued)
74 BNY
type information about the service providers covered
under the rule. We continue to evaluate the impact of
the proposed rule.
On Nov. 2, 2022, the SEC proposed for public
comment rule amendments that would require the
adoption of “swing pricing” and a “hard close” by all
open-end RICs other than money market funds and
exchange-traded funds (“Open-End Funds”). The
requirements would alter the manner in which shares
in Open-End Funds are traded, as shareholders would
no longer receive the NAV per share for their
transactions but instead could receive a price more or
less than the NAV depending on whether a “swing
factor” was applied to their transaction. This swing
factor would be the amount by which the Open-End
Fund adjusts its per-share NAV and would represent
a good-faith estimate of the transaction costs imposed
on current shareholders of the Open-End Fund by the
transacting shareholders. To facilitate the operation
of swing pricing, the SEC also proposed to require a
“hard close” for Open-End Funds, which would make
a purchase or sale order for shares of an Open-End
Fund eligible for a given day’s price only if the OpenEnd Fund or certain designated agents receive the
order before the time when the Open-End Fund
calculates its NAV, which is typically as of 4:00 PM
Eastern Time. We continue to evaluate the impact of
the proposed rule.
SEC Rule 6c-11 (the “ETF Rule”) under the 1940 Act
permits exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) that satisfy
certain conditions to organize and operate without
first obtaining an exemptive order from the SEC and
requires an ETF to make certain disclosures,
including historical data on an ETF’s premiums,
discounts and bid-ask spread information, as well as
the ETF’s daily portfolio holdings. The ETF Rule
also requires ETFs using custom baskets to put
written policies and procedures in place establishing
that the custom baskets are in the best interests of the
ETF and its shareholders. Pursuant to the ETF Rule,
BNY has launched a number of ETFs.
Certain of our subsidiaries are RIAs, and as such are
supervised by the SEC. They are also subject to
various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations
and to the laws and regulations of any countries in
which they conduct business. Our subsidiaries advise
both RICs, including the BNY Mellon Family of
Funds and BNY Mellon ETF Funds, and private
investment companies which are not registered under
the 1940 Act.
Certain of our investment management, trust and
custody operations provide services to employee
benefit plans that are subject to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), administered by the U.S. Department of
Labor. ERISA imposes certain statutory duties,
liabilities, disclosure obligations and restrictions on
fiduciaries, as applicable, related to the services being
performed and fees being paid.
SEC Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”) requires a
broker-dealer to act in the “best interest” of a retail
customer when making a recommendation of any
securities transaction or investment strategy to any
such customer. The Form CRS Relationship
Summary (“Form CRS”) requires RIAs and brokerdealers to provide retail investors with a brief
summary about the nature of their relationship with
their investment professional and supplements other
more detailed disclosures.
On Feb. 15, 2023, the SEC adopted final rule
amendments to shorten the standard settlement cycle
for certain broker-dealer securities transactions to
T+1. The compliance date for the transition to T+1
settlement under the final rule for in-scope
transactions was May 28, 2024.
On Dec. 14, 2022, the SEC proposed four
rulemakings related to market structure, including a
proposed Regulation Best Execution, which would
establish a best execution regulatory framework for
broker-dealers, and proposals regarding order
competition and disclosure of order execution
information. We continue to assess the potential
impacts of the proposals.
On Feb. 15, 2023, the SEC proposed amendments to
the custody rule under the 1940 Act, which generally
requires RIAs deemed to have custody of client funds
or securities to, among other requirements, maintain
client funds or securities with a qualified custodian.
The proposal would expand the types of investments
covered by the custody rule to include any client
“assets.” It would also require RIAs to enter into a
written agreement with, and obtain reasonable
assurances from, the qualified custodian that the
custodian will comply with protections in the
proposed rule, including with respect to
indemnification of the client, responsibility for
subcustodians and central securities depositaries,
asset segregation, and not subjecting client assets to
any liens. In addition, the SEC proposed
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 75
amendments to the investment adviser recordkeeping
rule to require advisers to keep additional, more
detailed records. We continue to evaluate the
potential impact of the proposals.
Operations and Regulations Outside the U.S.
We maintain a presence in the UK through the
London branch of The Bank of New York Mellon,
The Bank of New York Mellon (International)
Limited (a credit institution incorporated and
authorized in the UK), and a number of our
investment firms. We maintain a presence in the EU
through the Frankfurt branch of The Bank of New
York Mellon, BNY SA/NV, which is headquartered
in Belgium and has a branch network in a number of
other EU countries, and through certain of our
investment firms.
BNY SA/NV is a public limited liability company
incorporated under the laws of Belgium, holds a
banking license issued by the National Bank of
Belgium and is authorized to carry out all banking
and savings activities as a credit institution. The
European Central Bank (the “ECB”) has
responsibility for the direct supervision of significant
banks and banking groups in the Euro area, including
BNY SA/NV. The ECB’s supervision is carried out
in conjunction with the relevant national prudential
regulator (the National Bank of Belgium in BNY SA/
NV’s case), as part of the Single Supervisory
Mechanism. BNY SA/NV conducts its activities in
Belgium as well as through its branch offices in
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. In
Europe, branches of The Bank of New York Mellon
are subject to regulation in the countries in which
they are established, in addition to being subject to
oversight by BNY’s U.S. regulators.
Certain of our financial services operations in the UK
are subject to regulation and supervision by the FCA
and the PRA. The PRA is responsible for the
authorization and prudential regulation of firms that
carry on PRA-regulated activities, including banks.
PRA-authorized firms are also subject to regulation
by the FCA for conduct purposes. In contrast, FCAauthorized firms (such as investment management
firms) have the FCA as their sole regulator for both
prudential and conduct purposes. As a result, FCAauthorized firms must comply with FCA prudential
and conduct rules and the FCA’s Principles for
Businesses, while dual-regulated firms must comply
with the FCA conduct rules and FCA Principles, as
well as the applicable PRA prudential rules and the
PRA’s Principles for Businesses.
The PRA regulates The Bank of New York Mellon
(International) Limited, our UK-incorporated bank, as
well as the London branch of The Bank of New York
Mellon. Certain of BNY’s UK-incorporated
subsidiaries are authorized to conduct investment
business in the UK. Their investment management
advisory activities and their sale and marketing of
retail investment products are regulated by the FCA.
Certain UK investment funds, including investment
funds of BNY, are registered with the FCA and are
offered for sale to retail investors in the UK.
The types of activities in which the foreign branches
of our banking subsidiaries and our international
subsidiaries may engage are subject to various
restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve. Those
foreign branches and international subsidiaries are
also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of
the countries in which they operate and, in the case of
banking subsidiaries, may be subject to regulatory
capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they
operate.
The primary prudential framework in the EU is
provided by the Capital Requirements Directive (“EU
CRD”) and Capital Requirements Regulation (“EU
CRR”), both of which implement many elements of
the Basel III framework. On July 9, 2024, the texts of
the EU Capital Requirements Regulation 3 (“CRR3”)
and Capital Requirements Directive 6 (“CRD6”)
came into effect and will be implemented in phases
through to January 2027. Through these regulations,
the EU will implement the Basel 3.1 standards via
amendments to EU CRD and CRR. These changes
will affect the operations of BNY SA/NV (including
capital and liquidity requirements) and the Frankfurt
branch of The Bank of New York Mellon (including a
capital endowment requirement and additional
governance, reporting and supervisory obligations).
In addition, CRD6 will restrict the provision of
prescribed core banking services by non-EU entities
to EU clients, except where these services are
provided through an authorized EU branch or where
an exemption applies.
The UK’s version of the EU Capital Requirements
Regulation (“UK CRR”) provides the prudential
framework for credit institutions in the UK. Aspects
of UK CRR are currently proposed to be amended as
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
76 BNY
part of the PRA’s plans to implement the Basel 3.1
standards in the UK. The amended rules, which will
be relevant to the operations of The Bank of New
York Mellon (International) Limited, are set to apply
from Jan. 1, 2027.
In the EU, the Investment Firms Directive/Investment
Firms Regulation (“IFD/IFR”) is the EU’s prudential
regime for investment firms. The UK has
implemented its version of the IFD/IFR via the UK
Investment Firms Prudential Regime (“UK IFPR”).
Under both IFD/IFR and UK IFPR, the capital
requirements for most investment firms are based on
factors that are more tailored to the risks that
investment firms face, rather than Basel standards for
banks such as credit risk, market risk or operational
risk. BNY has several EU and UK-domiciled
investment firms that are subject to IFD/IFR and UK
IFPR respectively.
In addition, various proposed changes to regulations
in both the EU and the UK may impact our business.
In the EU, this includes the revised Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive II and Markets in
Financial Instruments Regulation (collectively,
“MiFID II”), the revised Alternative Investment Fund
Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), the Securitisation
Regulations, the revised regulation on OTC
derivatives, central counterparties and trade
repositories (commonly known as “EMIR”), and the
revised Payment Services Directive II (“PSD”).
The UK continues to implement post-Brexit changes
to its financial services’ regulatory framework as part
of an ongoing work program by HM Treasury, the
FCA and the PRA. This program is undertaken
pursuant to a range of initiatives, including the UK
Government’s Edinburgh Reforms (a series of
measures to promote stability and competitive growth
in the UK financial markets post-Brexit), the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, the Smarter
Financial Services Regulatory framework (which
continues to progress with the replacement of
assimilated EU law), and the UK's Wholesale
Markets Review.
The lines of business included in our Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management business segments are
subject to significant regulation in numerous
jurisdictions around the world relating to, among
other things, the safeguarding, administration and
management of client assets and client funds.
BNY continues to assess the impact of the
forthcoming changes outlined above on its operations.
Operational Resilience in Europe
The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act
(“DORA”) became effective on Jan. 17, 2025 and
harmonizes operational resiliency requirements
across the EU. DORA is broadly aligned with the
BCBS’ Principles for Operational Resilience, with a
focus on reducing risk of failure of information and
communication technology and the risk related to
financial entities’ dependencies on these items.
DORA requires financial entities operating in the EU,
including BNY SA/NV and the Frankfurt branch of
The Bank of New York Mellon to establish an
information and communications technology risk
management framework, including monitoring and
testing, incident response, business continuity, and
third-party risk management. BNY has implemented
a program designed to meet the applicable
requirements.
Banks and branches operating in the UK, including
the London branch of The Bank of New York Mellon
and The Bank of New York Mellon (International)
Limited, are required to finalize implementation of
PRA and FCA requirements on operational resilience
by March 31, 2025. The UK’s operational resilience
regime requires in-scope firms to identify “important
business services” critical to operations, map
necessary resources, processes and information to
deliver the critical services, establish maximum
disruption impact tolerances and related testing,
maintain a communication strategy, and document the
processes in policies and procedures. BNY has
evaluated the final rules and is working towards
implementing applicable requirements.
Funds Regulation in Europe
The AIFMD has a direct effect on our alternative
fund manager clients and our depository business and
other products offered across Europe as well as upon
our Investment Management business. AIFMD
imposes heightened obligations upon depositories,
which have operational effects.
Our businesses servicing regulated funds in Europe
and our Investment Management businesses in
Europe are also affected by the revised directive
governing the Directive on Undertakings for

Collective Investment in Transferable Securities
(“UCITS V”).
Under the regulations for depositary safekeeping
duties under AIFMD and UCITS V, the European
Commission recognizes the use of omnibus account
structures when accounting for assets in a chain of
custody, but requires that depositaries and trustees,
such as BNY, maintain their own books and records.
On April 15, 2024, an EU directive amending the
AIFMD entered into force (known as “AIFMD II”).
The revised AIFMD II regime introduces updated
rules for depositaries, a new loan origination
framework, and liquidity management rules for
alternative investment funds (“AIFs”). EU Member
States have until April 2026 to implement the
relevant changes under AIFMD II into their national
laws. BNY is assessing the impact of the changes on
its business.

78 BNY
An investment in securities issued by us involves
certain risks that you should carefully consider and
evaluate both at the time of initial purchase and
throughout the holding period of such securities. The
following discussion sets forth the most material risk
factors that could affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Some of these
risks are interrelated and the occurrence of one may
exacerbate the effect of others. Additionally, factors
other than those discussed below or in our other
reports filed with or furnished to the SEC could also
adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations. We cannot assure you that the
risk factors described below or elsewhere in our
reports address all potential risks that we may face.
These risk factors also serve to describe
considerations which may cause our results to differ
materially from those described in forward-looking
statements included herein or in other documents or
statements that make reference to this Annual Report.
See “Forward-looking Statements.”
Summary
Investing in our securities and in the securities of
banks and financial services companies more broadly
is inherently risky. Our business, financial condition
and results of operations may be materially and
adversely affected by various risk types and
considerations, including operational risk, market
risk, credit risk, capital and liquidity risk, strategic
risk and additional risks, including as a result of the
following:
Operational Risk
• Errors or delays in our operational and
transaction processing, or those of third parties.
• Our risk management framework, policies and
processes not being effective in identifying or
mitigating risk and reducing the potential for
losses and any inadequacy or lapse in our risk
management framework, policies and processes
exposing us to unexpected losses.
• Limitations of the models we use to measure,
monitor and manage risk.
• A communications or technology disruption or
failure within our infrastructure or the
infrastructure of third parties that results in a loss
of information, delays our ability to access
information or impacts our ability to provide
services to our clients.
• A cybersecurity incident, or failure in our
computer systems, networks and information, or
those of third parties, resulting in the theft,
disclosure, use or alteration of information,
unauthorized access to or loss of information, or
system or network failures.
• The development and use of artificial
intelligence.
• Extensive government rulemaking, policies,
regulation and supervision that impact our
operations, and changes to and introduction of
new rules and regulations compelling us to
change how we manage our businesses.
• Regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation.
• Failure to attract, retain, develop and motivate
employees.
• Failure or circumvention of our controls, policies
and procedures.
Market Risk
• Weakness and volatility in financial markets and
the economy generally.
• Dependence on fee-based business and fee-based
revenues, which could be adversely affected by
slowing market activity, weak financial markets,
underperformance and/or negative trends in
savings rates or in investment preferences.
• Levels of and changes in interest rates impacting
our profitability and capital levels.
• Unrealized or realized losses on securities related
to volatile and illiquid market conditions,
reducing our capital levels and/or earnings.
Credit Risk
• Failure or perceived weakness of any of our
significant clients or counterparties, and our
assumption of credit, counterparty and
concentration risk.
• Inadequacy in our allowance for credit losses,
including loan and lending-related commitment
reserves and a deterioration in our expectations of
future economic conditions.
Capital and Liquidity Risk
• Failure to effectively manage our liquidity.
• Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
Risk Factors
BNY 79
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more
generally.
• The Parent’s dependence on dividends from its
subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC
to meet its obligations, including with respect to
its securities, and to provide funds for share
repurchases, payment of income taxes and
payment of dividends to its stockholders.
• Ability to return capital to shareholders, which is
subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors
and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and
regulations, including those governing capital and
capital planning, applicable provisions of
Delaware law and our failure to pay full and
timely dividends on our preferred stock.
• Any material reduction in our credit ratings or the
credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries,
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon,
N.A. or The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV,
which could increase the cost of funding and
borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries.
• The application of our Title I preferred resolution
strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly
liquidation authority.
Strategic Risk
• New lines of business, new products and services
or transformational or strategic project initiatives,
and the failure to implement these initiatives.
• Our strategic transactions.
• Failure to realize some or all of the expected
benefits of our transition to a platforms operating
model.
• Competition in all aspects of our business.
Additional Risks
• Adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny or
other reputational harm.
• Impacts from geopolitical events, acts of
terrorism, war, natural disasters, the physical
effects of climate change, pandemics and other
similar events.
• Sustainability concerns, including a focus on
climate change and diversity, which could
adversely affect our business, affect client
activity levels, subject us to additional regulatory
requirements and damage our reputation.
• Tax law changes or challenges to our tax
positions with respect to historical transactions.
• Changes in accounting standards governing the
preparation of our financial statements and future
events.
Operational Risk
Errors or delays in our operational and transaction
processing, or those of third parties, may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and reputation.
We are required to accurately process large numbers
of transactions each day on a timely basis. The
transactions we process or execute are operationally
complex and can involve numerous parties,
jurisdictions, regulations and systems, and, therefore,
are subject to execution and processing errors and
failures. In situations reliant upon manual processes,
the risk of execution and processing errors and
failures is heightened. Manual processes are
inherently more prone to human and other processing
error, malfeasance, fraud and other misconduct than
automated processes. With more complex and
voluminous transactions at ever increasing speeds,
which present an increased risk of error or significant
operational delay, we must continuously evolve and
automate our processes, controls, technology, systems
and workforce in a manner designed to achieve
accurate and timely execution of these transactions.
When errors or delays do occur, they may be difficult
to detect and remediate in a timely manner. The use
of automation, artificial intelligence and other
emerging technologies in connection with automated
processes, may amplify the impact of any such error
or delay, as the failure to timely discover and respond
to an operational error can have dramatic
consequences, especially in connection with
automated processes in light of the speed and volume
of transactions involved. These risks are heightened
in connection with the implementation of new
products, systems or processes, which may present
new risks that may not be adequately identified, or for
which we may not have adequate controls.
Furthermore, the risks resulting from an operational
error may be heightened with respect to certain asset
classes, such as some digital assets, with respect to
which it may be impossible to retrieve wrongfully or
erroneously transferred digital assets.
Risk Factors (continued)
80 BNY
Our business, financial, accounting and processing
systems or other operating systems may stop
operating properly, become insufficient or become
disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors
including events that are wholly or partially beyond
our control. We have experienced, and in the future
expect to continue to experience, operational errors
and delays and disruptions to our transaction
processing systems. Such operational errors,
disruptions or significant operational delays could
have a material and negative impact on our ability to
conduct our business or service our clients, which
could adversely affect our results due to potentially
higher expenses and lower revenues, lower our
capital ratios, create liability for us or our clients or
negatively impact our reputation. We also recognize
that service reliability and systems resilience are
essential components to processing transactions and
safeguarding financial assets, and an operational error
impacting a large number of transactions could have
unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets,
which could exacerbate the adverse effects of the
error on us. There can be no assurance that our
business continuity response plans will effectively
mitigate our operational risks, and any backup
systems or processes may not sufficiently replace our
primary systems.
Affiliates or third parties (including their downstream
service providers) with which we do business or that
facilitate our business activities, including by
providing data, information, technology, security or
infrastructure services, have been, and could in the
future continue to be, sources of execution and
processing errors, breaches or loss, failures or
significant operational delays. These risks may be
amplified to the extent third parties (including their
downstream service providers, such as those that
provide data, cloud computing or other security or
technology services) with which we do business have
adopted the use of automation, artificial intelligence
and other emerging technologies. These risks are
further heightened to the extent that we rely on a
limited, or otherwise concentrated, set of third parties
with respect to certain processes or business
activities.
Our operations must comply with complex and
evolving laws and regulations, including heightened
regulatory and supervisory expectations with respect
to operational and information security systems. In
certain jurisdictions, we may be deemed to be
statutorily or criminally liable for operational errors,
fraud, breakdowns or delays by affiliates or third
parties with which we do business or that facilitate
our business activities. Additionally, as a result of
regulations, including the Alternative Investment
Fund Managers Directive and the Undertakings for
Collective Investment in Transferable Securities V,
when we act as depositary in the European Economic
Area, we could be exposed to restitution risk for,
among other things, errors or fraud perpetrated by a
sub-custodian resulting in a loss or delay in return of
client’s securities. When we are not acting as a
European Economic Area depositary, we may accept
similar liabilities to that of a European Economic
Area depositary as a matter of contract in connection
with our custody services.
Our risk management framework, policies and
processes may not be effective in identifying or
mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses
and any inadequacy or lapse in our risk
management framework, policies and processes
could expose us to unexpected losses that could
materially adversely affect our results of operations
or financial condition.
Our risk management framework seeks to identify
and mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established
comprehensive policies and procedures and an
internal control framework designed to provide a
sound operational environment for the types of risk to
which we are subject, including operational risk,
credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, model risk and
strategic risk. We have also established frameworks
designed to mitigate risk and loss to us as a result of
the actions of affiliates or third parties with which we
do business (including their common and downstream
service providers) or that facilitate our business
activities. However, as with any risk management
framework, there are inherent limitations to our
current and future risk management strategies,
including risks that we may not have appropriately
anticipated, identified or monitored.
Our regulators remain focused on ensuring that
financial institutions build and maintain robust risk
management policies. Regulators’ views of the
quality of our risk models and framework affect our
regulators’ evaluations of us, and we are exposed to
the risk of adverse regulatory and supervisory
developments, including enforcement actions and
increased costs in connection with remediation
efforts, if our regulators view our risk models and
framework to be insufficient or if remediation is not
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 81
completed in a timely manner. Accurate and timely
enterprise-wide risk information is necessary to
enhance management’s decision-making in times of
crisis. If our risk management framework or
governance structure proves ineffective or if our
enterprise-wide management information is
incomplete or inaccurate, we could suffer unexpected
losses, which could materially adversely affect our
results of operations or financial condition.
In addition, our businesses and the markets in which
we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail
to fully understand the implications of changes in our
businesses, industry or the financial markets or fail to
adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to
address those changes. If our risk framework is
ineffective because it fails to keep pace with changes
in the industry, financial markets, regulatory
requirements, our businesses, our counterparties,
clients or service providers or for other reasons, we
could incur losses, suffer reputational damage, face
significant remediation expenses or find ourselves out
of compliance with applicable regulatory or
contractual mandates or supervisory expectations.
Our control environment and related systems, from
time to time, have in the past not sufficiently
detected, and may in the future not sufficiently detect,
each error, omission or other mistake made by us.
These have in the past included, and may in the future
include, calculation errors, errors in software or
model development or implementation, data or
informational errors or incompleteness, or errors in
judgment. Human errors, malfeasance, failure to
follow applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures
and other misconduct in connection with our risk
management framework, policies and processes, even
if promptly discovered and remediated, have in the
past resulted, and could in the future result, in
inaccurate reporting to regulatory bodies, reputational
damage and losses and liabilities for us.
An important aspect of our risk management
framework is creating a risk culture that is sustainable
and appropriate to our role as a major financial
institution in which our employees understand that
there is risk in every aspect of our business and the
importance of managing risk as it relates to their job
functions. If we fail to create the appropriate
environment that sensitizes our employees to
managing risk, our business could be adversely
impacted. For more information on how we monitor
and manage our risk management framework, see
“Risk Management – Overview.”
Limitations of the models we use to measure,
monitor and manage risk could lead to unexpected
losses and adverse business impacts.
We rely on quantitative and qualitative models,
analytical techniques and judgment-based estimations
to measure, monitor and manage various risks,
including credit, market, liquidity and operational
risks. These models are also used for financial and
other regulatory reporting, capital planning and other
critical functions. While essential for decisionmaking, models are inherently limited and subject to
inaccuracies stemming from flawed assumptions,
design issues or evolving market conditions. Further,
even absent flawed or inadequate model assumptions,
design issues and data inaccuracies, there can be no
assurance that the models we utilize will adequately
mitigate risk or loss to us under all circumstances.
Our models depend on historical data, assumptions
and correlations that may not accurately predict future
conditions, particularly during periods of market
stress or economic uncertainty. For example,
unexpected geopolitical events, rapidly evolving
market conditions or unforeseen economic downturns
may render model assumptions inadequate.
Additionally, models may fail to fully capture
interdependencies among risk factors, leading to
incomplete or misleading outputs.
In certain instances, we rely on models to measure,
monitor and predict risks, including as part of our
overall asset/liability management. However, these
models are inherently limited because they involve
techniques, including the use of historical data and
trends, assumptions, estimates, judgments and
forecasts, which may be incomplete or inaccurate.
These models cannot anticipate every economic and
financial outcome, particularly during severe market
downturns, geopolitical events or other stress events
such as those experienced during the COVID-19
pandemic or in connection with the insolvencies of
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in 2023.
The models that we use to assess and control our
market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about
the degree of correlation among prices of various
asset classes or other market indicators. The 2008
financial crisis and resulting regulatory reform
highlighted both the importance and some of the
Risk Factors (continued)
82 BNY
limitations of managing unanticipated risks. In times
of market stress, limited liquidity or other unforeseen
circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators
may become correlated, or previously correlated
indicators may move in different directions.
Additionally, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines
in prices of certain assets may make it more difficult
to value certain financial instruments. These types of
market movements have at times limited the
effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have
caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do
so in the future.
Weaknesses in model design, implementation or
governance may result in flawed outputs, increasing
risks. Inaccuracies in input data or issues with data
quality or effectiveness can further amplify these
risks. To the extent that our models utilize data
provided by third parties, deficiencies in the accuracy,
timeliness or completeness of third-party data or the
effectiveness in our controls and validation processes,
could further amplify these risks. Models utilizing
artificial intelligence, machine learning or other
emerging technologies present additional challenges,
including biases in algorithms or datasets, potentially
leading to ineffective decision-making, reporting
errors or other unintended consequences.
Weaknesses in model risk management practices,
including lapses in oversight, monitoring and
application, could negatively impact business
operations and regulatory compliance. Failure to
identify or address deficiencies promptly may result
in operational losses, penalties, increased capital
requirements or reputational harm.
Although we have implemented policies, procedures
and controls designed to mitigate model risk, these
measures cannot fully eliminate the inherent
limitations of modeling practices. If our models fail
to measure, monitor or predict risks appropriately, we
could face financial losses, reputational harm,
regulatory actions and material impacts on our
business and financial results.
A communications or technology disruption or
failure within our infrastructure or the
infrastructure of third parties that results in a loss
of information, delays our ability to access
information or impacts our ability to provide
services to our clients may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.
We extensively rely on communications and
information systems to conduct our business. Our
businesses are highly dependent on our ability to
process large volumes of data in an accurate,
complete and timely manner, which requires global
capabilities and scale from our technology platforms.
If our technology or communications fail, or those of
industry utilities or our service providers fail, we have
in the past experienced, and could in the future
experience, production and system outages or
failures, or other significant operational delays. In
addition, any technology disruption or failure could
result in the loss of confidential or customer data, as a
result of which we could incur losses, suffer
reputational damage, face significant remediation
expenses or find ourselves out of compliance with
applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or
supervisory expectations with respect to the
preservation of confidential information. Any such
disruption, outage, failure or delay could adversely
affect our ability to effect transactions or service our
clients, which could expose us to liability for
damages, result in the loss of business, damage our
reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or
sanctions or expose us to litigation, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Remote
work arrangements have increased our reliance on
remote access systems and video conferencing
services, and, as a result, we are exposed to similar
risks if the technology and communications systems
our employees or employees of third parties use while
working remotely fail. Security or technology
disruptions, failures or delays that impact our
communications or information systems could also
adversely affect our ability to manage our exposure to
risk or expand our business. These incidents are
unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources,
not all of which are in our control, including, among
others, human error, malfeasance and other
misconduct, as well as operational disruptions at a
third party or third party’s downstream service
provider.
Upgrading our computer systems, software and
networks may be time-consuming and may subject us
to the risk of disruptions, failures or delays due to the
complexity and interconnectedness of our computer
systems, software and networks. The failure to
properly upgrade or maintain these computer systems,
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 83
software and networks could result in greater
susceptibility to cyberattacks, particularly in light of
the greater frequency and severity of cyberattacks in
recent years, as well as the growing prevalence of
cyberattacks affecting third-party software and
information service providers. Additionally, cloud
technologies are becoming increasingly critical to the
operation of our systems and platforms, and, as our
reliance on this technology continues to grow, we will
continue to be increasingly subject to evolving risks
relating to the use of cloud technologies. Our new
product initiatives, including in connection with
digital asset services, may further expose us to new
and evolving technology risks and may lead to
dependencies on, and compatibility issues with,
decentralized or third-party blockchains and their
protocols, which we do not control. Although we
have programs and processes to identify such risks,
there can be no assurance that any such disruptions,
failures or delays will not occur or, if they do occur,
that actions taken to mitigate their impact will be
timely or adequate. Although we maintain insurance
covering certain technology infrastructure losses and
intend to maintain such insurance coverage if it is
available to us on commercially reasonable terms,
there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we
may incur, including as a result of a cybersecurity
incident, will be covered under such policies or that
the amount of insurance will be adequate.
We continue to evaluate and seek opportunities to
strengthen our business continuity and operational
resiliency capabilities and have increased our
investments in technology to steadily enhance those
capabilities, including our ability to resume and
sustain our operations. There can be no guarantee,
however, that a technology outage will not occur,
including as a result of failures related to upgrades
and maintenance, that our incident response processes
will be effective to efficiently identify and respond to
an adverse event, or that our business continuity and
operational resiliency capabilities will enable us to
maintain our operations and appropriately respond to
events. For a discussion of operational risk, see “Risk
Management – Risk Types Overview – Operational
Risk.”
Third parties with which we do business or that
facilitate our business activities, including exchanges,
clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors
that provide services or security solutions for our
operations, have in the past been, and could in the
future also be, sources of technology risk to us,
including from breakdowns, capacity constraints,
attacks (including cyberattacks targeted at
downstream service providers), failures or delays of
their own systems or other services that impede their
ability to provide products or services to us, which, in
turn, could impair our ability to process transactions
and communicate with customers and counterparties.
This risk may be intensified to the extent that there is
concentration in a single unique product or service
provided by a single vendor, or to the extent we rely
on service providers from a single geographic area or
due to the nature of the third-party’s industry and
operations (e.g., firms that may have less robust scale,
financial and operational resiliency standards with
which to defend against a cyberattack). We may not
be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational
risks impacting our vendors or relating to the use of
common and other vendors by third-party service
providers, which could result in potential liability to
clients and customers, regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions, increased operational costs or harm
to our reputation.
As our business areas evolve, whether due to the
introduction of technology, new service offering
requirements for our clients, interactions with thirdparty service providers, or changes in regulation
relative to these service offerings, unforeseen risks
materially impacting our business operations could
arise. The technology used has become increasingly
complex and relies on the continued effectiveness of
the programming code and integrity of the inputted
data. Rapid technological changes and competitive
pressures require us to make significant and ongoing
investments in technology not only to develop
competitive new products and services or adopt new
technologies, but to sustain our current businesses.
Our financial performance depends in part on our
ability to develop and market these new products and
services in a timely manner at a competitive price and
adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate
our products or provide cost efficiencies. The failure
to adequately review and consider critical business
changes prior to and during introduction and
deployment of key technological systems, or the
failure to adequately align operational capabilities
with evolving client commitments and expectations,
subjects us to the risk of an adverse impact on our
ability to service and retain customers and on our
operations. The costs we incur in enhancing our
technology could be substantial and may not
ultimately improve our competitiveness or
profitability.
Risk Factors (continued)
84 BNY
As a result of financial entities, including financial
technology companies, central agents, clearing agents
and houses, exchanges and technology systems across
the globe becoming more interconnected and
complex, a technology failure or other operational
incident that significantly degrades, deletes or
compromises the systems or data of one or more
financial entities or suppliers increases the risk that
such disruptions could have a material impact on
counterparties or other market participants, including
us. A disruptive event, failure or delay experienced
by one institution could disrupt the functioning of the
overall financial system and has in the past impaired,
and could in the future impair, our ability to settle
transactions, which could, in turn, increase our
counterparty credit and other exposures.
A cybersecurity incident, or a failure in our
computer systems, networks and information, or
those of third parties, could result in the theft,
disclosure, use or alteration of information,
unauthorized access to or loss of information, or
system or network failures. Any such incident or
failure could adversely impact our ability to conduct
our businesses, damage our reputation and cause
losses.
We have been, and we expect to continue to be, the
target of varying degrees of attempted cyberattacks,
computer viruses or other malicious software, denial
of service efforts, phishing attacks, penetration
attempts and other information security threats
intended to disrupt our operations, including
unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks
targeted at third-party service providers and their
downstream service providers. Remote working
arrangements, our employees’ usage of mobile and
cloud technologies and our reliance on third-party
service providers leave our networks susceptible to
greater access points for attackers to exploit. This
further increases the risk of unauthorized access to
our networks and results in greater amounts of
information being available for access, all of which
heightens risks relating to the frequency and severity
of cyberattacks against us and our third-party service
providers and their downstream service providers.
Although we deploy a broad range of sophisticated
defenses and continue to expend significant resources
to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance
that these security measures will provide absolute
security or prevent breaches and attacks, and we
could suffer a material adverse impact or disruption
as a result of a cybersecurity incident.
Cybersecurity incidents may occur through or as a
result of system errors, lack of adequate policies and
procedures, human error, software vulnerabilities
(which may be unknown), potential lapses in
information security practices or other irregularities,
and intentional or unintentional acts by individuals or
groups (including employees, vendors, customers and
state actors, as well as others with malicious intent)
having authorized or unauthorized access to our
systems, data-bearing devices or facilities as well as
the systems, devices or facilities of our clients,
counterparties or third-party service providers.
Malicious actors, who may see their effectiveness
enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence, such as
through the use of “deep-fake” technology or
quantum computing, may also attempt to place
individuals within BNY or fraudulently induce
employees, vendors, customers or other users of our
systems through social engineering, such as phishing,
to disclose sensitive information in order to gain
access to our data or that of our clients, or to send
funds or authorize the sending of funds. A
cybersecurity incident that results in the theft, loss,
disclosure, use or alteration of information (which
may include confidential or proprietary information),
system or network failures, or unauthorized access or
loss of access to information, may require us to
reconstruct lost data (which may not be possible) or
reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring
services, or result in loss of customer business or
damage to our computers or systems and those of our
customers and counterparties. Further, although the
application of distributed ledger technology is
growing, such technology is nascent and may be
vulnerable to cyberattacks or have other weaknesses,
which could result in the loss of customer assets,
including customer funds or custodied digital assets.
Losses of certain types of assets, such as digital
assets, may be distinctly difficult to recover and could
subject us to customer disputes, claims for
reimbursement, losses, negative publicity,
reputational damage and governmental and regulatory
scrutiny, investigations and enforcement actions.
Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global
basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat
actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in
using novel techniques and tools, including artificial
intelligence and other emerging technologies, that
have the potential to circumvent controls, evade
detection and even remove forensic evidence. Thus,
the risk of an occurrence of a cybersecurity incident is
inherent to a decision to invest in our company and
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 85
the financial services sector as a whole. These
impacts could be costly and time-consuming and
could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
While we seek to mitigate these risks to ensure the
integrity of our systems and information and
continuously evolve our cybersecurity capabilities,
there can be no assurance that our mitigation
strategies will be effective against all forms of
cyberattacks. It is also possible that employees or
services providers may not follow our policies and
procedures and we may not anticipate or implement
effective preventive measures against all
cybersecurity threats, or detect all such threats,
including because the techniques used change,
develop and evolve frequently or are not recognized
until after they are launched. Third parties with
which we do business or that facilitate our business
activities are also subject to the foregoing risks, and
we can not guarantee that they will maintain effective
systems and controls to mitigate and respond to these
threats, or that they will properly implement and
execute the policies and processes in the manner
described to us. The failure of any third-party service
provider to promptly detect, respond to or report
cybersecurity incidents may adversely affect our
ability to effectively report or respond to
cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner.
Moreover, attacks can originate from a wide variety
of sources, including malicious actors who are
involved with organized crime or who may be linked
to terrorist organizations or state or quasi-state actors,
or from cross-contamination of legitimate parties
(including vendors and their service providers,
clients, financial market utilities and other financial
institutions). Risks relating to attacks on our vendors,
including supply chain attacks affecting our software
and information technology service providers, have
been rising as such attacks become increasingly
frequent and severe and as financial entities and
technology systems have become increasingly
consolidated, interdependent and complex.
The failure to maintain an adequate technology
infrastructure and applications with effective
cybersecurity controls relative to the type, size and
complexity of operations, markets and products
traded, access to trading venues and our market
interconnectedness could impact operations and
impede our productivity and growth, which could
cause our earnings to decline or could impact our
ability to comply with regulatory obligations, leading
to regulatory fines and sanctions. We may be
required to expend significant additional resources,
including through the use of third parties, to address
exposures arising from cybersecurity risks and
threats. Despite our procedures intended to identify
and mitigate the impact of cybersecurity incidents, a
cybersecurity incident, including as a result of a
successful cyberattack, could occur and persist for an
extended period of time before being detected. In
addition, we may not be able to identify and fully
assess the impact of a cybersecurity incident in a
timely manner. An investigation of a cybersecurity
incident is inherently unpredictable and the extent of
a particular cybersecurity incident and the path of
investigating the incident may not be immediately
clear. It may take a significant amount of time before
such an investigation can be completed and reliable
information about the incident is known. While such
an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily
know the source and extent of the harm or how best
to contain and remediate it, certain errors or actions
could be repeated or compounded before they are
discovered and remediated, and communication to the
public, clients, regulators and other stakeholders may
not be sufficiently timely or accurate, any or all of
which could further increase the costs and
consequences of a cybersecurity incident. Moreover,
as a public company subject to Exchange Act
reporting requirements, we are required to publicly
disclose certain information about a material
cybersecurity event, including the impact or
reasonably likely impact. Disclosure may be required
before the incident has been resolved or fully
investigated. As with the determination of materiality
of any other type of event, the determination
regarding the materiality of any particular
cybersecurity incident or series of related incidents
entails a facts-and-circumstances test that takes a
number of quantitative and qualitative factors into
account. As a result, our management may determine
that certain cybersecurity incidents are immaterial
and not subject to disclosure under applicable
cybersecurity regulations. For example, depending
on the particular facts and circumstances, our
management may reach such a determination if,
among other things, the incident (or a series of related
incidents) does not substantially disrupt our ability to
operate normally, or deliver our products and services
to our clients and the market on a timely basis, or
result in the loss or compromise of a significant
amount of data or potentially significant expenses or
liabilities. As a result, investors should not assume
that the absence of disclosure under the new
Risk Factors (continued)
86 BNY
regulations means that our defenses have been
successful in preventing and defending every
cyberattack directed at us or our third-party service
providers.
In addition, we rely on a variety of measures to
protect our intellectual property and proprietary
information, including copyrights, trademarks,
patents and controls on access and distribution.
These measures may not prevent misappropriation or
infringement of our intellectual property or
proprietary information and a resulting loss of
competitive advantage. Furthermore, if a third party
were to assert a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of its proprietary rights, obtained
through patents or otherwise, against us, we could be
required to spend a significant amount of resources to
defend such claims, develop alternative methods of
operations, pay substantial money damages, obtain a
license from the third party or possibly stop providing
one or more products or services. In addition, we
conduct business in various jurisdictions that may not
have comparable levels of protection for intellectual
property and proprietary information as the U.S. The
protection afforded in those jurisdictions may be less
established and/or predictable. As a result, there may
also be heightened risks associated with the potential
theft of data, proprietary information, technology and
intellectual property in those jurisdictions by
domestic or foreign actors, including private parties
and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors.
Any theft of data, proprietary information, technology
or intellectual property may negatively impact our
operations and reputation, including disrupting our
business activities in those jurisdictions.
We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to
the protection and privacy of the information of
clients, employees and others, and any failure to
comply with these laws and regulations could expose
us to liability, increased regulatory oversight and/or
reputational damage.
The development and use of artificial intelligence
present risks and challenges that may adversely
impact our business.
The use and development of artificial intelligence by
us, our third-party vendors, clients, counterparties and
other market participants in certain business
processes, models, including generative artificial
intelligence models, services or products may expose
us to risks and potential liabilities. These risks may
occur as a result of enhanced governmental or
regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns,
confidentiality or other security risks, intellectual
property concerns over data rights and protection,
heightened susceptibility to cyberattacks, increased
frequency and severity of cyberattacks, inaccurate or
biased algorithms or underlying datasets, misuse or
misappropriation as well as other factors that could
adversely affect our business, reputation and financial
results. In addition, poor implementation of artificial
intelligence, by us or our third-party providers, could
subject us to additional risks that we cannot
adequately predict or mitigate.
The failure to strategically embrace the potential of
artificial intelligence may result in a competitive
disadvantage for us. Although we are incorporating
artificial intelligence technologies into some of our
products, services and processes, if we cannot offer
new artificial intelligence-facilitated technologies as
quickly as our competitors, if our competitors
develop more cost-effective solutions or other
product offerings, or if we are not able to source
components, such as artificial intelligence chips due
to a supply chain shortage amid rising geopolitical
uncertainty, we could experience a material adverse
effect on our operating results, customer relationships
and growth opportunities.
Furthermore, the use or adoption of artificial
intelligence into our products or services may result
in exposure to claims by third parties of copyright
infringement or other intellectual property
misappropriation, which may require us to pay
compensation or license fees to third parties. The
evolving legal, regulatory and compliance framework
for artificial intelligence both in the U.S. and
internationally may also impact our ability to protect
our own data and intellectual property against
infringing use and could require changes in our
implementation of artificial intelligence technology
and increase our compliance costs and the risk of
non-compliance. Additionally, we may not be able to
control how third-party artificial intelligence that we
choose to use are developed or maintained, or how
data we input into such tools are used or disclosed,
even where we have sought protections with respect
to these matters.
We are subject to extensive government rulemaking,
policies, regulation and supervision that impact our
operations. Changes to and introduction of new
rules and regulations have compelled, and in the
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 87
future may compel, us to change how we manage
our businesses, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
As a large, internationally active financial services
company, we operate in a highly regulated
environment, and are subject to a comprehensive
statutory and regulatory regime affecting all aspects
of our business and operations, including oversight by
governmental agencies both inside and outside the
U.S. Regulations and related regulatory guidance and
supervisory oversight impact how we analyze certain
business opportunities, our capital and liquidity
requirements, the revenue profile of certain of our
core activities, the products and services we provide,
how we manage our balance sheet, how we return
capital to shareholders, how we monitor and manage
risk and how we promote a sound governance and
control environment. Any changes to the regulatory
frameworks and environment in which we operate,
including changes to interpretation of existing and
future laws, rules and regulations, and the significant
management attention and resources necessary to
address those changes could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations and have other negative consequences.
In the future, we could become subject to additional
laws, rules and regulations, including related to the
safekeeping of client assets, cybersecurity and data
protection, digital assets, artificial intelligence and
other emerging technologies, climate risk
management and sustainability-related governance
and reporting, including additional disclosure
requirements with respect to sustainability-related
goals, investment strategies, risk management and
emissions. In addition, certain regulatory initiatives
within and outside of the U.S. may overlap and/or
conflict with each other, which could subject us to
additional compliance costs and regulatory risk. This
reflects the nature of developments relating to
cybersecurity, digital assets, artificial intelligence and
climate regulation, including the increased and ever
shifting focus globally by regulators and other
governmental authorities on these topics and the
relatively uncertain, distinct and novel nature of the
associated principles.
The evolving regulatory environment and uncertainty
about the timing and scope of future regulations may
contribute to decisions we may make to suspend,
reduce or withdraw from existing businesses,
activities or initiatives, which may result in potential
lost revenue or significant restructuring or related
costs or exposures. We also face the risk of
becoming subject to new or more stringent
requirements in connection with the introduction of
new regulations or modification of existing
regulations, which could require us to hold more
capital or liquidity, limit our ability to make
distributions or have other adverse effects on our
businesses or profitability. In addition, regulatory
responses in connection with severe market
downturns or unforeseen stress events may lead to
new rules and regulations, all of which may increase
our operational costs and alter or disrupt our planned
future strategies and actions. We are also exposed to
the risk of a special assessment, including under the
FDI Act, in the event of the failure of a bank or nonbank financial institution, which has in the past
adversely affected, and may in the future adversely
affect, our results of operations.
The monetary, tax and other policies of various
governments, agencies and regulatory authorities both
in the U.S. and globally have a significant impact on
interest rates, currencies, commodity pricing, the
imposition of tariffs, counter tariffs or other
limitations on international trade and travel, and
overall financial market performance, which can
impact our business, results of operations and capital.
Changes in these policies are beyond our control and
can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine
the ultimate effect that any such changes would have
upon our business, financial condition or results of
operations. For example, the outcome of elections in
the United States and internationally, and the
resulting political administration transition in
jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in
additional uncertainties in the regulatory and
economic landscape. Legal or regulatory changes
affecting access to financial markets can also
adversely affect us.
The regulatory and supervisory focus of U.S. banking
agencies is primarily intended to protect the safety
and soundness of the banking system and federally
insured deposits, and not to protect investors in our
securities. Regulatory and supervisory standards and
expectations both within jurisdictions (in relation to
national versus non-national financial services
providers) and across jurisdictions may be divergent
and otherwise may not be applied in a manner that is
consistent and harmonized. Additionally, banking
regulators have wide supervisory discretion in the
Risk Factors (continued)
88 BNY
ongoing examination and enforcement of applicable
banking statutes, regulations and guidelines, and may
restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or
acquisitions or may require us to limit our capital
distributions, maintain more capital or hold more
highly liquid assets.
The U.S. capital rules subject us and our U.S. banking
subsidiaries to stringent capital requirements, which
could restrict growth, activities or operations, trigger
divestiture of assets or operations or limit our ability
to return capital to shareholders.
The LCR and NSFR require us to maintain significant
holdings of high-quality and generally lower-yielding
liquid assets. In calculating the LCR and NSFR, we
must also determine which deposits should be
considered stable deposits. Stable deposits must meet
a series of requirements and typically receive
favorable treatment under the LCR and NSFR. We
use qualitative and quantitative analysis to identify
core stable deposits. It is possible that our LCR and
NSFR could fall below applicable regulatory
requirements as a consequence of the inherent
uncertainties associated with this analysis (including
as a result of regulatory changes or additional
guidance from our regulators). In addition to facing
potential regulatory consequences (which could be
significant), we may be required to remedy this
shortfall by liquidating assets in our investment
portfolio or raising additional debt, each of which
could have a material negative impact on our net
interest income.
We develop and submit plans for our rapid and
orderly resolution in the event of material financial
distress or failure to the Federal Reserve and the
FDIC. If the agencies determine that our submissions
are not credible or would not facilitate an orderly
resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and we
fail to address any such deficiencies in a timely
manner, we may be subject to more stringent capital
or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our
growth, activities or operations, or may be required to
divest assets or operations, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Our global activities are also subject to extensive
regulation and supervision by various non-U.S.
regulators, including governments, securities
exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies
in the jurisdictions in which we operate, relating to,
among other things, the safeguarding, administration
and management of client assets and client funds,
regulation of markets, recovery and resolution
planning and payments and financial market
infrastructure.
Various laws, regulations, rules and directives
effective in the jurisdictions in which we operate have
an impact on our provision of many products and
services. Implementation of, and revisions to, these
laws, regulations, rules and directives have affected
our operations and risk profile. For example, the key
regulatory frameworks impacting our operations in
the EU and UK continue to diverge in a number of
respects. Further divergence in the nature and scope
of these regulations could have an adverse impact on
our results of operations and business prospects.
In addition, we are subject in our global operations to
rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal
payments and money laundering, economic sanctions
and embargo programs administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar bodies
and governmental agencies worldwide, and laws
relating to doing business with certain individuals,
groups and countries, such as the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, as
amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, the Iran Threat
Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and
the UK Bribery Act. While we have invested and
continue to invest significant resources in training and
in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity
of our operations, employees, clients and customers,
as well as the vendors and other third parties that we
deal with, presents the risk that we may be found in
violation of such rules, regulations or laws and any
such violation could subject us to significant penalties
or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, such
rules could impact our ability to engage in business
with certain individuals, entities, groups and
countries, which could materially adversely affect
certain of our businesses and results of operations.
Government sanctions and our actions in response to
them have had, and in the future could continue to
have, a negative impact on our revenue and business.
For example, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
in 2022, we ceased new banking business in Russia.
As a result of the implementation of data protectionrelated laws and regulations, including the EU GDPR,
the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the China
Personal Information Protection Law of 2021 and the
New York Department of Financial Services’
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 89
cybersecurity regulation, we need to allocate
additional time and resources to comply with such
laws and regulations, and our potential liability for
non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case
of data breaches has significantly increased. In
addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to
laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance,
encryption and data localization in the jurisdictions in
which we operate. Compliance with these laws and
regulations has required us to change our policies,
procedures and technology for information security
and segregation of data, which, among other things,
makes us more vulnerable to operational failures, and
to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and
regulations.
Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies,
or meet supervisory expectations, applicable to us and
our businesses could result in civil or criminal
sanctions or enforcement proceedings by regulatory
or governmental authorities, money penalties and
reputational damage, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. If violations of legal or
regulatory requirements do occur, they could damage
our reputation, increase our legal and compliance
costs, including requiring us to devote substantial
resources towards remediation efforts, and ultimately
adversely impact our results of operations. Laws,
regulations or policies currently affecting us and our
subsidiaries, supervisory expectations, or regulatory
and governmental authorities’ interpretation of
statutes and regulations may change at any time,
which may adversely impact our business and results
of operations. See “Supervision and Regulation” for
additional information regarding the potential impact
of the regulatory environment on our business.
Regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation
could materially adversely affect our results of
operations or harm our businesses or reputation.
Like many major financial institutions, we and our
affiliates are the subject of inquiries, investigations,
lawsuits and proceedings by counterparties, clients,
other third parties, tax authorities and regulatory and
other governmental agencies in the U.S. and abroad,
as well as the Department of Justice and state
attorneys general. See “Legal proceedings” in Note
22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for a discussion of material legal and regulatory
proceedings in which we are involved. The number
of these investigations and proceedings, as well as the
amount of penalties and fines sought, has remained
elevated for many firms in the financial services
industry, including us. We have in the past been, and
may in the future become, subject to heightened
regulatory scrutiny, inquiries or investigations, and
potentially client-related inquiries or claims, relating
to broad, industry-wide concerns that could lead to
increased expenses or reputational damage.
Regulators and other governmental authorities may
also be more likely to pursue enforcement actions, or
seek admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in
connection with the resolution of an inquiry or
investigation to the extent a firm has previously been
subject to other governmental investigations or
enforcement actions. The current trend of large
settlements by financial institutions with
governmental entities may adversely affect the
outcomes for other financial institutions in similar
actions, especially where governmental officials have
announced that the large settlements will be used as
the basis or a template for other settlements.
Separately, policymakers globally continue to focus
on protection of client assets, cybersecurity and data
protection, the improper use of electronic
communications as well as tax avoidance and
evasion.
The complexity of the federal and state regulatory
and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with
the global scope of our operations and the increased
aggressiveness of the tax and regulatory environment
worldwide, also means that a single event may give
rise to a large number of overlapping investigations
and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal
and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple
regulators and other governmental entities or tax
authorities in different jurisdictions. Responding to
inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and proceedings,
regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, is
time consuming and expensive and can divert the
attention of our senior management from our
business. The outcome of such proceedings may be
difficult to predict or estimate until late in the
proceedings, which may last a number of years.
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to periodic
examination, special inquiries and potential
proceedings by regulatory authorities. If compliance
failures or other violations are found during an
examination, inquiry or proceeding, a regulatory
agency could initiate actions and impose sanctions for
violations, including, for example, regulatory
agreements, remediation undertakings, cease and
Risk Factors (continued)
90 BNY
desist orders, civil monetary penalties or termination
of a license and could lead to litigation by investors
or clients, any of which could cause our earnings to
decline. Further, we are subject to regulatory
settlements, orders and feedback that have in the past
contained, and in the future may continue to contain,
requirements for us to undertake certain remedial
measures, including enhancements to existing
controls, systems and procedures. Failure to
implement these remedial measures in a timely
manner could result in further adverse consequences,
such as further investigations or proceedings or
additional penalties, fines, judgments or additional
remedial actions.
Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others
may sue us, claiming that we or third parties for
whom they say we are responsible have failed to
perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry
out a duty perceived to be owed to them, including
perceived fiduciary or contractual duties. This risk
may be heightened during periods when credit, equity
or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or
are particularly volatile, when clients or investors are
experiencing losses or as public attention on issues
such as climate change or other sustainability-related
matters intensifies. In some cases, additional third
parties that would otherwise be defendants in such
cases, or that have agreed to indemnify for such
losses, may be bankrupt or in financial distress, or
may not honor their obligations. As a publicly held
company, we are also subject to the risk of claims
under the federal securities laws. Volatility in our
stock price increases this risk.
Increasingly, regulators, tax authorities and courts
have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the
misconduct of their clients where such regulators and
courts have determined that the financial institution
should have detected that the client was engaged in
wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had
no direct knowledge of the wrongdoing.
Actions brought against us may result in lawsuits,
enforcement actions, injunctions, settlements,
damages, fines or penalties, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations or require changes to our
business. Claims for significant monetary damages
are asserted in many of these legal actions, while
claims for disgorgement, penalties and/or other
remedial sanctions may be sought in regulatory
matters. These risks may be more acute when
operating in foreign jurisdictions or in instances
where adversaries to such disputes are government or
quasi-government actors otherwise motivated in
whole or in part by non-commercial incentives.
Although we establish accruals for our litigation and
regulatory matters in accordance with applicable
accounting guidance, our exposure to such litigation
and regulatory matters can be unpredictable, and
when those matters proceed to a stage where they
present loss contingencies that are both probable and
reasonably estimable, there may be a material
exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued, or
in excess of any loss contingencies disclosed as
reasonably possible. Such loss contingencies may not
be probable and reasonably estimable until the
proceedings have progressed significantly, which
could take several years and occur close to resolution
of the matter.
Each of the risks outlined above could result in
increased regulatory supervision and affect our ability
to attract and retain customers or maintain access to
the capital markets.
Our business may be adversely affected if we are
unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate
employees.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to
attract new employees, retain, develop and motivate
our existing employees, have a diverse and inclusive
workplace and continue to compensate our employees
competitively amid heightened regulatory restrictions.
Competition for the most skilled employees in most
activities in which we engage can be intense,
especially in critical strategic locations, and we may
not be able to recruit and retain key personnel. In
addition, third-party suppliers and service providers
on which we rely may face challenges in attracting
and retaining their employees, which may have a
negative impact on our operations and our resiliency
capabilities.
We rely on certain employees with subject matter
expertise to assist in the implementation of important
initiatives and to support the development of new
products and services, including in connection with
our technology initiatives. As focus on technology
and risk management increases in the financial
industry, competition for technologists and risk
personnel has intensified, which could constrain our
ability to execute on certain of our strategic
initiatives.
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 91
Our ability to attract, retain and motivate key
executives and other highly qualified employees may
be negatively impacted by the level and composition
of our compensation and benefits programs and by
continuous changes to immigration policies and other
restrictions applicable to incentive and other
compensation programs, including deferral, clawback
requirements and other limits on incentive
compensation. Some of these restrictions may not
apply to some of our competitors and to other
institutions with which we compete for talent, in
particular as we are more often competing for
personnel with financial technology providers and
other entities that may not be publicly traded or
regulated banking organizations and, in either case,
may not have the same limitations on compensation
as we do. Furthermore, because a portion of our
annual incentive compensation paid to some of our
employees is deferred equity that is subject to the
value of our common stock, declines in our
profitability or outlook could adversely affect the
ability to attract and retain employees. Additionally,
recent changes to our executive management may
create uncertainty, divert resources, be disruptive to
our daily operations or impact public or market
perception, any of which could result in an adverse
impact on our business.
The loss of employees’ skills, knowledge of the
market and industry experience, and the cost of
finding replacements, particularly in competitive
labor markets, have led, and may continue to lead, to
an increase in labor costs, which may hurt our
business. In addition, our current or future approach
to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not
meet the needs or expectations of our current or
prospective employees, may not be perceived as
favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by
competitors and may not be conducive to a
collaborative working environment, which could
adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, develop
and motivate employees. If we are unable to continue
to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly
qualified employees, our performance, including our
competitive position, could be adversely affected.
A failure or circumvention of our controls, policies
and procedures could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and reputation.
Management regularly reviews and updates our
internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures,
and corporate policies and procedures. Any system
of controls, however well designed and operated, is
based in part on certain assumptions and can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the
objectives of the system will be met. Any failure or
circumvention of our controls and procedures or
failure to comply with regulations related to controls
and procedures could have a material adverse effect
on our business, reputation, results of operations and
financial condition. Moreover, if we identify material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting or are otherwise required to restate our
financial statements, we could be required to
implement expensive and time-consuming remedial
measures and could lose investor confidence in the
accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.
In addition, there are risks that individuals, either
employees or contractors, may circumvent
established control mechanisms in order to, for
example, exceed exposure, liquidity, trading or
investment management limitations, or commit fraud.
We are also subject to additional risks that the third
parties with which we do business fail to comply with
our policies and procedures or fail to notify us
promptly of any noncompliance.
Additionally, although we have policies and
procedures prohibiting the use of unauthorized
personal devices and applications by our employees
and contractors, we are subject to inquiries by
regulators with respect to recordkeeping obligations
and are subject to additional risks related to the use of
personal devices and non-approved platforms,
applications and tools by our employees or by third
parties with which we do business for work-related
activities, including risks related to information
security and potential violations of record retention,
reporting and other requirements. Any failure to
comply with such policies and procedures could
adversely affect our business.
Market Risk
Weakness and volatility in financial markets and the
economy generally may materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
As a financial institution, our Investment
Management, Wealth Management, Pershing,
Depositary Receipts and Markets, including
Securities Lending, businesses are particularly
sensitive to economic and market conditions,
Risk Factors (continued)
92 BNY
including in the capital and credit markets. Further,
when these markets are volatile or disruptive, we
have experienced declines in our fair valued assets,
including in our securities portfolio and seed capital,
as well as a fair value reduction in the portfolios that
we manage that generate investment and wealth
management fees. Conditions in the financial
markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S.
and elsewhere around the world have materially
affected, and may continue to affect, our results of
operations, including investment management fees.
Foreign exchange trading that we execute for clients
generates revenues which are primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by
market volatility and the impact of foreign exchange
hedging activities. Our clients’ cross-border
investing activity could decrease in reaction to
economic and political uncertainties, including
changes in laws or regulations governing cross-border
transactions, such as currency controls or tariffs.
Volumes and/or spreads in some of our products tend
to benefit from currency volatility and are likely to
decrease during times of lower currency volatility.
Such revenues also depend on our ability to manage
the risk associated with the currency transactions we
execute and program pricing.
A variety of factors impact global economies and
financial markets, including interest rates and their
associated yield curves, commodity pricing, market
and political instabilities, volatile debt and equity
market values, inflation, expectations relating to
inflation trends and monetary policy actions taken by
central banks, the strength of the U.S. dollar,
geopolitical tensions, the imposition of tariffs,
counter tariffs or other limitations on international
trade or travel, including changes to international
trade and investment policies by the U.S., the EU or
other large economies (which could disrupt world
trade, lead to trade retaliation and other supply chain
complications), unemployment levels, labor strikes,
declining business, investor and consumer
confidence, recessionary fears, the impact of
volatility in digital asset markets on the broader
market, governmental budget deficits (including, in
the U.S., at the federal, state and municipal levels),
partial or full government shutdowns (including
concerns about the stability of funding for the U.S.
federal government) and contagion risk from possible
default on sovereign debt. More specifically, in
recent years, the U.S. government has approached its
statutory debt limit, which required specific measures
taken by the U.S. Treasury Department to prevent the
U.S. government’s default on its payment obligations.
In the future, delays to raise or suspend the federal
debt ceiling in similar circumstances could have
severe repercussions within the U.S. and to global
credit and financial markets and could result in a
variety of adverse effects for our business, results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Any resulting economic pressure on market
participants and lack of confidence in the financial
markets may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally,
global economies and financial markets may be
adversely affected by widespread health emergencies,
pandemics, natural disasters, climate-related
incidents, conflicts and acts of war (such as the
conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East),
terrorism, economic sanctions, other geopolitical
events, for example, the economic and geopolitical
challenges related to China, including developing
tensions between China and Taiwan and/or between
China and the U.S., or concerns over the possible
escalation, continuation or duration of such events.
In particular, we face the following risks in
connection with these factors, some of which are
discussed at greater length in separate risk factors:
• Geopolitical tension and economic instability in
countries around the world can at times increase
the demand for low-risk investments, particularly
in U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. A “flight to
safety” has historically increased our balance
sheet, which has negatively impacted, and could
continue to negatively impact, our leverage-based
regulatory capital measures. A sustained “flight
to safety” has historically triggered a decline in
trading, capital markets and cross-border activity
which would likely decrease our revenue,
negatively impacting our results of operations,
financial condition and, if sustained in the long
term, our business.
• The fees earned by our Investment Management
and Wealth Management businesses are higher as
assets under management and/or investment
performance increase. Those fees are also
impacted by the composition of the assets under
management, with higher fees for some asset
categories as compared to others. Uncertain and
volatile capital markets, particularly declines,
could result in movements from higher to lower
fee products and/or reductions in our assets under
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 93
management because of investors’ decisions to
withdraw assets or from simple declines in the
value of assets under management as markets
decline.
• Market conditions resulting in lower transaction
volumes could have an adverse effect on the
revenues and profitability of certain of our
businesses such as clearing, settlement, payments
and trading.
• The discontinuation of an interest rate
benchmark, and the adoption and implementation
of alternative reference rates, could adversely
impact our business activities and our underlying
operations. We utilize reference rates in a variety
of agreements and instruments and are
responsible for the use of reference rates in a
variety of capacities, as well as in our operational
functions. We could be subject to claims from
customers, counterparties, investors or regulators
alleging that we did not correctly discharge our
responsibilities in interpreting and implementing
contractual interest rate provisions or in selecting
new alternative reference rates. These types of
claims could subject us to increased legal and
operational expenses and could damage our
reputation.
• Uncertain and volatile capital markets,
particularly declines in equity prices, could
reduce the value of our investments in securities,
including pension and other post-retirement plan
assets and produce downward pressure on our
stock price and credit availability without regard
to our underlying financial strength.
• Derivative instruments we hold for our own
account to hedge and manage our exposure to
market risks, including interest rate risk, equity
price risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk
associated with our products and businesses
might not perform as intended or expected,
resulting in higher realized losses and unforeseen
stresses on liquidity. Our derivatives-based
hedging strategies also rely on the performance of
counterparties to such derivatives. These
counterparties may fail to perform for various
reasons resulting in losses on under-collateralized
positions.
• The process we use to estimate our expected
credit losses is subject to uncertainty in that it
requires use of statistical models and difficult,
subjective and complex judgments, including
forecasts of economic conditions and how these
conditions might impair the ability of our
borrowers and others to meet their obligations. In
uncertain and volatile economic environments,
and especially in environments that differ
significantly from the historical environments
upon which the models we use to estimate our
expected credit losses were developed, our ability
to estimate our expected credit losses may be
impaired, which could adversely affect our
overall profitability and results of operations.
For a discussion of our management of market risk,
see “Risk Management – Risk Types Overview –
Market Risk.”
We are dependent on fee-based business for a
substantial majority of our revenue and our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by
slowing market activity, weak financial markets,
underperformance and/or negative trends in savings
rates or in investment preferences.
Our principal commercial focus is on fee-based
business, which is distinct from commercial banking
institutions that earn most of their revenues from
loans and other traditional interest-generating
products and services. For the year ended Dec. 31,
2024, 73% of our total revenue was fee-based. Our
fee-based businesses include investment and wealth
management, custody, corporate trust, depositary
receipts, clearing, collateral management and treasury
services, which are highly competitive businesses.
Fees for many of our products and services are based
on the volume of transactions processed, the market
value of assets managed and/or administered,
securities lending volume and spreads, and fees for
other services rendered. Corporate actions, crossborder investing, global mergers and acquisitions
activity, new debt and equity issuances, and
secondary trading volumes, among other things, all
affect the level of our fee revenue. As the volume of
these activities decreases due to low client activity,
weak financial markets or otherwise, our fee-based
revenues also decrease, which negatively impacts our
results of operations.
If our Investment and Wealth Management
businesses experience poor investment returns due to
weak market conditions or underperformance
(relative to competitors or benchmarks), the market
values of the portfolios that we manage will be lower
(on a relative basis) and our ability to retain existing
Risk Factors (continued)
94 BNY
assets and/or attract new client assets may be
impacted. Market and regulatory trends have also
resulted in increased demand for lower fee investment
and wealth management products and services, and
lower performance-fee structures, both of which have
impacted and may continue to impact our fee
revenue. Some of these dynamics have also
negatively impacted fees in our Market and Wealth
Services and Securities Services businesses and any
of these dynamics may also occur in the future.
Significant declines in the volume of capital markets
activity would reduce the number of transactions we
process and the amount of securities we lend and
therefore would also have an adverse effect on our
results of operations. Our business may be adversely
impacted by decreases in the rate at which individuals
invest in mutual funds and other collective funds, unit
investment trusts or exchange-traded funds, or
contribute to defined contribution plans. Changes in
economic and market conditions, including as a result
of higher market volatility, inflationary pressures,
recessionary conditions or declines in equity values,
could result in changes in the investment patterns of
our clients or negatively impact the market value of
client portfolios, each of which could have a negative
impact on our results of operations.
When our investment management revenues decline,
interest rates rise or other market factors affect the
value of our investment management business, we
may have, and in the past have had, declines in the
fair value in our Investment Management reporting
unit, one of the two reporting units in our Investment
and Wealth Management segment. If the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit declines
below its carrying value, we would be required to
take, and in the past have taken, an impairment
charge.
Levels of and changes in interest rates have
impacted, and will in the future continue to impact,
our profitability and capital levels, at times
adversely.
We earn revenue, known as “net interest income,” on
the difference between the interest income earned on
our interest-earning assets, such as the loans we make
and the securities we hold in our investment securities
portfolio, and the interest expense incurred on our
interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and
borrowed money. Additionally, we earn net interest
income on other activities relating to interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such as reverse
repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements,
respectively. Our net interest margin, which is the
result of dividing net interest income by average
interest-earning assets, is sensitive to the shape of the
yield curve and whether the interest rate paid or
received is fixed or moves with changes in market
interest rates.
The continued prevalence of higher rates, and any
future rate increases, including unexpectedly
precipitous increases, could adversely impact our
business, financial condition and results of
operations, due to:
• higher market volatility, recessionary conditions
and declines in equity values, resulting in a
decline in the valuation of assets under
management;
• reduced liquidity in bonds and fixed-income
funds, resulting in lower performance and fees;
• increased number of delinquencies, bankruptcies
or defaults and more nonperforming assets and
net charge-offs, as borrowers may have more
difficulty making higher interest payments;
• higher redemptions from our fixed-income funds
or separate accounts, as clients move funds into
investments with higher rates of return;
• lower net interest income and net interest margin
due to lower non-interest bearing deposit levels,
as non-interest bearing deposits leave or shift to
interest-bearing deposits;
• declines in deposit levels, resulting in reduced
internal and regulatory liquidity buffers and lower
revenues;
• reductions in the value of our fixed-income
securities held for liquidity purposes;
• further increases in accumulated other
comprehensive loss in our shareholders’ equity
and therefore our tangible common equity due to
the impact of rising long-term rates on the
available-for-sale securities in our investment
portfolio, which would negatively affect our riskbased and leverage based regulatory capital
ratios; or
• higher funding cost.
Conversely, a material decline in the short-term rate
environment, and/or a flat or inverted yield curve, in
the future could adversely impact, and has in the past
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 95
adversely impacted, our net interest income and
results of operations due to:
• compression of our net interest margin,
depending on our balance sheet position and the
speed and size of the interest rate decline;
• sustained weakness of our spread-based revenues,
resulting in continued voluntary waiving of fees
on certain money market mutual funds and
related distribution fees, in order to prevent the
yields on such funds from becoming uneconomic;
or
• adverse impacts on the value of our fixed-rate
mortgage-backed securities, driven by higher
mortgage prepayment speeds.
Our business activities involve investing in interestbearing assets and incurring interest-bearing liabilities
with varying durations. Changes in the direction and
levels of interest rates, the relationship between shortand long-term rates and the speed of interest rate
changes have in the past impacted, and in the future
are expected to continue to impact, our net interest
margin, capital ratios and overall financial position.
Changes in the direction and level of interest rates
may also have adverse impacts on our clients and
counterparties, which could adversely impact
multiple aspects of our business, including our fee
revenue, allowance for credit losses and deposit mix.
Although we have policies and procedures in place to
assess and mitigate the potential impacts of changes
in the direction and level of interest rates, these
policies and procedures may not be able to effectively
mitigate these risks. If our assumptions about any
number of factors used in our interest rate models are
incorrect, or if there are unforeseen changes in
external environment that are out of our control, it
could negatively impact our results of operation and
financial position.
A more detailed discussion of the interest rate and
market risks we face is contained in “Risk
Management – Risk Types Overview – Market Risk.”
We have experienced, and may continue to
experience, unrealized or realized losses on
securities related to volatile and illiquid market
conditions, reducing our capital levels and/or
earnings.
We maintain an investment securities portfolio of
various holdings, types and maturities. At Dec. 31,
2024, approximately 64% of these securities were
classified as available-for-sale, which are recorded on
our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains
or losses reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax. The
securities in our held-to-maturity portfolio, recorded
on our balance sheet at amortized cost, were
approximately 36% of our securities portfolio at Dec.
31, 2024. Our available-for-sale securities portfolio,
to the extent unhedged, may result in increased
volatility in our accumulated other comprehensive
income or earnings relative to a loan portfolio that is
accounted for at amortized cost.
Our investment securities portfolio represents a
greater proportion of our consolidated total assets
(approximately 33% at Dec. 31, 2024), in comparison
to many other major U.S. financial institutions due to
our custody and trust bank business model.
Accordingly, our capital levels and results of
operations and financial condition are materially
exposed to the risks associated with our investment
securities portfolio, including interest rate-related
risks.
We reserve for current expected credit losses with
respect to our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
securities. Credit losses in excess of our allowance
for credit losses would impact our results of
operations.
Under the U.S. capital rules, after-tax changes in the
fair value of available-for-sale investment securities
are included in CET1 capital. Since held-to-maturity
securities are not subject to fair-value accounting,
changes in the fair value of these instruments (other
than expected credit losses) are not similarly included
in the determination of CET1 capital. As a result, we
may experience increased variability in our CET1
capital relative to those major financial institutions
who maintain a lower proportion of their consolidated
total assets in an available-for-sale accounting
classification.
Generally, the fair value of available-for-sale
securities is determined based on market prices
available from third-party sources. During periods of
market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain
of our investment securities if trading becomes less
frequent and/or market data becomes less observable.
As a result, valuations may include inputs and
assumptions that are less observable or require greater
estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods
which are more complex. These values may not be
Risk Factors (continued)
96 BNY
ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such
values may change very rapidly as market conditions
change and valuation assumptions are modified.
Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations or financial condition.
The estimate of expected credit losses is determined
in part by management’s assessment of the financial
condition and prospects of a particular issuer,
projections of future cash flows and recoverability of
the particular security. Management’s conclusions on
such assessments are highly judgmental and include
assumptions and projections of future cash flows
which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as
assumptions, facts and circumstances change. On the
other hand, we are limited in the actions we can take
related to our held-to-maturity securities absent a
significant deterioration in the issuer’s
creditworthiness. Therefore, we may be constrained
in our ability to liquidate a held-to-maturity security
that is deteriorating in value. If our determinations
change about our intention or ability to not sell
available-for-sale securities that have experienced a
reduction in fair value below their amortized cost, we
could be required to recognize a loss in earnings for
the entire difference between fair value and amortized
cost.
For information regarding our investment securities
portfolio, refer to “Results of Operations –
Consolidated balance sheet review – Securities.”
Credit Risk
The failure or perceived weakness of any of our
significant clients or counterparties, many of whom
are major financial institutions or sovereign entities,
and our assumption of credit, counterparty and
concentration risk, could expose us to credit losses
and adversely affect our business.
We have credit exposure to clients and counterparties
in many different industries, particularly financial
institutions, as a result of trading, clearing and
financing, providing custody services, securities
lending services or other relationships. We routinely
execute transactions with global clients and
counterparties in the financial industry as well as
sovereigns and other governmental or quasigovernmental entities. Our direct credit exposure
consists of extensions of secured and unsecured credit
to clients and use of our balance sheet. In addition to
traditional credit activities, we also extend intraday
credit in order to facilitate our various processing,
settlement and intermediation activities. We could be
adversely affected by the actions and commercial
soundness of organizations to whom we have lent
funds, as defaults or non-performance (or even
uncertainty concerning such default or nonperformance) by one or more of these institutions, or
the markets generally, have in the past led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or
defaults by us or by other institutions (including our
counterparties and/or clients) in the future. The
consolidation and failures of financial institutions
during the 2008 financial crisis increased the
concentration of our client and counterparty risk.
As a result of our membership in several industry
clearing or settlement exchanges and central
counterparty clearinghouses, we may be required to
guarantee obligations and liabilities or provide
financial support in the event that other members do
not honor their obligations or default. These
obligations may be limited to members that dealt with
the defaulting member or to the amount (or a multiple
of the amount) of our contribution to a clearing or
settlement exchange guarantee fund, or, in a few
cases, the obligation may be unlimited. Additionally,
we are exposed to settlement risks, particularly in our
payments and foreign exchange activities. Those
activities may lead to extensions of credit and
consequent losses in the event of a counterparty
breach or an operational error, including the failure to
provide credit. We are exposed to risk of short-term
credit extensions to, or overdrafts by, our clients in
connection with the process to facilitate settlement of
trades and related foreign exchange activities,
particularly when contractual settlement has been
agreed with our clients. The occurrence of overdrafts
at peak volatility could create significant credit
exposure to our clients depending upon the value of
such clients’ collateral pledged to us at the time. This
risk may be heightened during periods of market
volatility, during which collateral values may
decrease suddenly.
When we provide credit to clients in connection with
providing cash management, clearing, custodial and
other services, we are exposed to potential loss if the
client experiences credit difficulties. Higher market
volatility, inflationary pressures, recessionary
conditions or declines in equity values could
negatively affect the creditworthiness of our clients,
which, in turn, would increase our credit risk. We are
also generally not able to net exposures across
affiliated clients or counterparties and may not be
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 97
able to net exposures to the same legal entity across
multiple products. In addition, we may incur a loss in
relation to one entity or product even though our
exposure to one of the entity’s affiliates is overcollateralized. Moreover, not all of our client or
counterparty credit exposure is secured.
In our agency securities lending program, we act as
agent on behalf of our clients, the lenders of
securities, in securities lending transactions with our
clients’ counterparties (including broker-dealers),
acting as borrowers, wherein securities are lent by our
clients and the securities loans are collateralized by
cash or securities posted by such counterparties.
Typically, in the case of cash collateral, our clients
authorize us as their agent to invest the cash collateral
in approved investments pursuant to each client’s
investment guidelines and instructions. Such
approved investments may include reverse repurchase
transactions with repo counterparties. In many cases,
in the securities loans we enter into on behalf of our
clients, we agree to replace the client’s loaned
securities that the borrower fails to return due to
certain defaults by the borrower, mainly the
borrower’s insolvency. Therefore, in situations
where the market value of the loaned securities that
the borrower fails to return to a client (which loaned
securities we are obligated to replace and return to the
client) exceeds the amount of proceeds resulting from
the liquidation of the client’s approved investments
and cash and non-cash collateral of such client, we
may be responsible for the shortfall amount necessary
to purchase any replacement securities. In addition,
in certain cases, we may also assume the risk of loss
related to approved investments that are reverse
repurchase transactions as described above. In these
two scenarios, we, rather than our clients, are exposed
to the risks of the defaulting counterparty in the
securities lending transactions and, where applicable,
in the reverse repurchase transactions. For further
discussion on our securities lending indemnifications,
see “Commitments and contingent liabilities – Offbalance sheet arrangements” in Note 22 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
From time to time, we assume concentrated credit
risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or group
level, potentially exposing us to a single market or
political event or a correlated set of events. For
example, we may be exposed to defaults by
companies located in countries with deteriorating
economic conditions or by companies in certain
industries. Our commercial real estate portfolio also
exposes us to concentrated credit risk, including to
the New York metro market. Such concentrations
may be material. Our counterparty exposures change
daily, and the counterparties or groups of related
counterparties to which our risk exposure is material
also vary during any reported period; however, our
largest exposures tend to be to other financial
institutions, clearing organizations and governmental
entities, both inside and outside the U.S.
Concentration of counterparty exposure presents
significant risks to us and to our clients because the
failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties
(or in some cases of our clients’ counterparties) has
the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss.
Changes in market perception of the financial
strength of particular financial institutions or
sovereign issuers can occur rapidly, are often based
on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.
Although our overall business is subject to these
interdependencies, several of our businesses are
particularly sensitive to them, including our currency
and other trading activities, our securities lending and
securities finance businesses and our investment
management business. If we experience any of the
losses described above, it may materially and
adversely affect our results of operations.
We are also subject to the risk that our contractual
rights against third parties may not be enforceable in
all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the
credit quality of third parties whose securities or
obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the
value of collateral posted by third parties to secure
their obligations to us under derivatives contracts and
other agreements, could result in losses and/or
adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or
otherwise use those securities or obligations for
liquidity purposes. Disputes with clients and
counterparties as to the valuation of collateral can
significantly increase in times of market stress and
illiquidity. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or
transparency of the financial markets may result in
our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of
our positions, thereby leading to increased
concentrations. An inability to reduce our positions
may not only increase the market and credit risks
associated with such positions but may also increase
the level of RWA on our balance sheet, thereby
increasing our capital requirements and funding costs,
all of which could adversely affect the operations and
profitability of our businesses.
Risk Factors (continued)
98 BNY
Under U.S. regulatory restrictions on credit exposure,
which include a broadening of the measure of credit
exposure, we are required to limit our exposures to
specific obligors or groups, including financial
institutions. These regulatory credit exposure
restrictions may adversely affect our businesses and
may require us to modify our operating models or the
policies and practices we use.
Further, we maintain sub-custodian relationships in
certain jurisdictions, including emerging and other
underdeveloped markets. Our use of sub-custodians
exposes us to operational, reputational and regulatory
risk, as we are dependent upon such sub-custodians to
perform certain services to clients in those markets.
The risks of maintaining custody services in such
markets are amplified due to evolving regulatory and
sanctions requirements, which may increase our
financial exposures, in the event those subcustodians, or we, are unable to return, transfer or
reinvest clients’ assets. Under certain regulatory
regimes, we may be held responsible for resulting
losses suffered by our clients, and we may agree to
similar or more stringent standards with clients that
are not subject to such regulations. Where we have
client deposit liabilities related to non-U.S. currencies
in jurisdictions where we maintain sub-custodian
relationships, we generally maintain a corresponding
amount of cash on deposit with the relevant subcustodian or clearing agency, which increases our
credit exposure to that entity and can accumulate over
time based upon distributions on, or other activities
related to, our clients’ assets. If the sub-custodian or
clearing agency were to become insolvent in
circumstances not involving expropriation of assets or
other circumstances that may excuse performance
under relevant client agreements, the risk of loss on
such cash on deposit could be ours rather than the
clients’.
We could incur losses if our allowance for credit
losses, including loan and lending-related
commitment reserves, is inadequate or if our
expectations of future economic conditions
deteriorate.
When we loan money, commit to loan money or
provide credit or enter into another contract with a
counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of loss if
our borrowers do not repay their loans or our
counterparties fail to perform according to the terms
of their agreements. Our profitability is adversely
affected when our borrowers default, in whole or in
part, on their loan obligations to us or when there is a
significant deterioration in the credit quality of our
loan portfolio. We reserve for potential future credit
losses by recording a provision for credit losses
through earnings. The allowance for loan losses and
allowance for lending-related commitments
represents management’s estimate of current expected
credit losses over the lifetime of the related credit
exposure taking into account relevant information
about past events, current conditions and reasonable
and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions that affect the collectability of our loans
and lending commitments. We use a quantitative
methodology and qualitative framework for
determining the allowance for loan losses and the
allowance for lending-related commitments. Within
this qualitative framework, management applies
judgment when assessing internal risk factors and
environmental factors to compute an additional
allowance for each component of the loan portfolio.
As is the case with any such judgments, we could fail
to identify these factors or accurately estimate their
impact. We cannot provide any assurance as to
whether charge-offs related to our credit exposure
may occur in the future. Current and future market
and economic developments may increase default and
delinquency rates and negatively impact the quality of
our credit portfolio, which may impact our chargeoffs. Although our estimates contemplate current
conditions and how we expect them to change over
the life of the portfolio, it is reasonably possible that
actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in
those estimates, which could materially affect our
results of operations and financial condition. See
“Results of Operations – Critical accounting
estimates.”
Capital and Liquidity Risk
Our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected if we do not
effectively manage our liquidity.
Our operating model and overall strategy rely heavily
on our access to financial market utilities and global
capital markets. Without such access, it would be
difficult to process payments and settle and clear
transactions on behalf of our clients. Deterioration in
our liquidity position, whether actual or perceived,
can impact our market access by affecting
participants’ willingness to transact with us. Changes
to our liquidity can be caused by various factors, such
as funding mismatches, a failure in our asset/liability
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 99
management, market constraints disabling asset to
cash conversion, inability to issue debt on terms
acceptable to us, run-offs of core deposits and
contingent liquidity events such as additional
collateral posting. Changes in economic conditions
or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and
reputational risks can also affect our liquidity.
Our business is dependent in part on our ability to
meet our cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flows. We also must manage liquidity risks on
an intraday basis, in a manner designed to ensure that
we can access required funds during the business day
to make payments or settle immediate obligations,
often in real time. We receive client deposits through
a variety of investment management and investment
servicing businesses and we rely on those deposits as
a low-cost and stable source of funding. Our ability
to continue to receive those deposits, and other shortterm funding sources, is subject to variability based
on a number of factors, including volume and
volatility in the global securities markets, the relative
interest rates that we are prepared to pay for those
deposits and the perception of the safety of those
deposits or other short-term obligations relative to
alternative short-term investments available to our
clients. We could lose deposits if we suffer a
significant decline in the level of our business
activity, our credit ratings are materially downgraded,
interest rates continue to rise or remain at elevated
levels, or if we or our peers become subject to
significant negative press or significant regulatory
action or litigation, among other reasons. Our
liquidity could also be adversely affected by
customers’ withdrawal of deposits in response to
volatility and disruptions in the financial markets or a
stress event. Such stress events may impact certain
industries in which our depositors may be
concentrated or correlated and may consequently
disproportionally affect our liquidity. Further,
deposit outflows could increase if our clients and
customers with uninsured deposits look for
alternative placements for their funds amidst market
and financial industry volatility. A perceived loss of
confidence in BNY as a depository institution may be
additionally exacerbated by the speed and
pervasiveness with which information, which may be
inaccurate or incomplete, is disseminated through
social media or other internet forums. If we were to
lose a significant amount of deposits, we may need to
replace such funding with more expensive funding
and/or reduce assets, which would reduce our net
interest income.
The degree of client demand for short-term credit
tends to increase during periods of market turbulence.
For example, investors in mutual funds for which we
act as custodian may engage in significant redemption
activity due to adverse market or economic
conditions. We may then extend intraday credit to
our fund clients in order to facilitate their ability to
pay such redemptions. In addition, during periods of
market turbulence, draws under committed revolving
credit facilities that we provide to our institutional
clients may increase, and have in the past increased,
substantially. Such client demand may negatively
impact our leverage-based capital ratios, and in times
of sustained market volatility, may result in
significant leverage-based ratio declines.
In addition, our access to the debt and equity capital
markets and credit markets is a significant source of
liquidity. Events or circumstances often outside of
our control, such as market disruptions, lack of
liquidity in the markets, government fiscal and
monetary policies, uncertainty over the U.S.
government debt ceiling or loss of confidence by
securities purchasers or counterparties in us or in the
funds markets, could limit our access to capital
markets and credit markets, increase our cost of
borrowing, adversely affect our liquidity or impair
our ability to execute our business plan. In addition,
clearing organizations, regulators, clients and
financial institutions with which we interact may
exercise the right to require additional collateral
based on market perceptions or market conditions,
which could further impair our access to and cost of
funding. Market perception of sovereign default risks
can also lead to inefficient money markets and capital
markets, which could further impact our funding
availability and cost. Conversely, excess liquidity
inflows could increase interest expense, limit our
financial flexibility and increase the size of our total
assets in a manner that could have a negative impact
on our capital ratios.
Under the U.S. capital rules, the size of the capital
surcharge that applies to a U.S. G-SIB is based in part
on its reliance on short-term wholesale funding,
including certain types of deposit funding, which may
increase the cost of such funding. Furthermore,
certain non-U.S. authorities require large banks to
incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in
which they operate and to maintain independent
Risk Factors (continued)

capital and liquidity at foreign subsidiaries. These
requirements could hinder our ability to efficiently
manage our funding and liquidity in a centralized
manner, requiring us to hold more capital and
liquidity overall.
In addition, our cost of funding could be affected by
actions that we may take in order to satisfy applicable
LCR and NSFR requirements, to lower our G-SIB
score, to satisfy the amount of eligible long-term debt
outstanding under the TLAC rule, to address
obligations under our resolution plan or to satisfy
regulatory requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions
relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in certain
subsidiaries. Further, the regulatory or stress test
liquidity value associated with the securities we hold
subject to a held-to-maturity accounting designation
could be reduced in the future through regulatory or
supervisory action, exposing us to relatively greater
capital ratio volatility attributable to interest rate
movements to the extent we designate a relatively
larger percentage of our securities portfolio as
available-for-sale going forward in response to such
regulatory or supervisory changes.
If we are unable to raise funds using the methods
described above, we would likely need to finance,
reduce or liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our
central bank deposits and bank placements, or
securities in our investment portfolio to meet funding
needs. We may be unable to sell some of our assets,
or we may have to sell assets at a discount from
market value, either of which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Further, our ability to sell assets may be
impaired if other market participants are seeking to
sell similar assets at the same time, which could occur
in a liquidity or other market crisis. Additionally, if
we experience cash flow mismatches, deposit run-off
or market constraints resulting from our inability to
convert assets to cash or access capital markets, our
liquidity could be severely impacted. During periods
of market uncertainty, our level of client deposits has
in recent years tended to increase; however, because
these deposits have high potential run-off rates, we
have historically deposited these so-called excess
deposits with central banks and in other highly liquid
and low-yielding instruments.
If we are unable to continue to fund our assets
through deposits or access capital markets on
favorable terms or if we suffer an increase in our
borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our
liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin,
financial results and condition may be materially
adversely affected. In certain cases, this could
require us to raise additional capital through the
issuance of preferred or common stock, which could
dilute the ownership of existing stockholders and/or
reduce common stock repurchases or our common
stock dividend, to preserve capital. For a further
discussion of our liquidity, see “Results of Operations
– Liquidity and dividends.”
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally,
could result in limitations on our activities and
adversely affect our business and financial
condition.
Under U.S. and international regulatory capital
adequacy rules and other regulatory requirements, we
and our subsidiary banks must meet or exceed
thresholds that include quantitative measures of
assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items,
subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about
components, risk weightings and other factors. As
discussed in “Supervision and Regulation,” BNY is
registered with the Federal Reserve as a BHC and an
FHC. An FHC’s ability to maintain its status as an
FHC is dependent upon a number of factors,
including its U.S. bank subsidiaries qualifying on an
ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well
managed” under the banking agencies’ prompt
corrective action regulations as well as applicable
Federal Reserve regulations. Failure by an FHC or
one of its U.S. bank subsidiaries to qualify as “well
capitalized” and “well managed,” if unremedied over
a period, would cause it to lose its status as an FHC
and could affect the confidence of clients in it,
compromising its competitive position. Additionally,
an FHC that does not continue to meet all the
requirements for FHC status could lose the ability to
undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are
not generally permissible without FHC status or to
continue such activities.
The failure by one of our U.S. bank subsidiaries to
maintain its status as “well capitalized” could lead to,
among other things, higher FDIC assessments and
could have reputational and associated business
consequences.
If we or our subsidiary banks fail to meet U.S. and
international minimum capital rules and other
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 101
regulatory requirements, we may not be able to
deploy capital in the operation of our business or
distribute capital to stockholders, which may
adversely affect our business.
Failure to meet any current or future capital or
liquidity requirements, including those imposed by
the U.S. capital rules, the LCR or the NSFR, or by
regulators in implementing other portions of the Basel
III framework, could materially adversely affect our
financial condition. Compliance with U.S. and
international regulatory capital and liquidity
requirements may impact our ability to return capital
to shareholders and may impact our operations by
requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings,
issue additional equity or other securities, or cease or
alter certain operations, which may adversely affect
our results of operations.
Finally, our regulatory capital ratios, liquidity metrics
and related components are based on our current
interpretation, expectations and understanding of the
applicable rules and are subject to, among other
things, ongoing regulatory review, regulatory
approval of certain statistical models, additional
refinements, modifications or enhancements (whether
required or otherwise) to our models and further
implementation guidance. Any modifications
resulting from these ongoing reviews, the adoption of
new or heightened prudential regulatory
requirements, or the continued implementation of the
U.S. capital rules (such as proposed revisions to
implement and finalize the Basel III reforms), the
LCR, the NSFR, the resolution planning process and
related amendments, could result in changes in our
RWAs, capital components, liquidity inflows and
outflows, HQLA, or other elements involved in the
calculation of these measures, which could impact
regulatory capital and liquidity ratios. Further,
because operational risk is currently measured based
not only upon our historical operational loss
experience but also upon ongoing events in the
banking industry generally, our level of operational
RWAs could significantly increase or otherwise
remain elevated and may potentially be subject to
significant volatility, negatively impacting our capital
ratios. The uncertainty caused by these factors could
ultimately impact our ability to meet our goals,
supervisory requirements and regulatory standards.
The Parent is a non-operating holding company
and, as a result, is dependent on dividends from its
subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC to
meet its obligations, including with respect to its
securities, and to provide funds for share
repurchases, payment of income taxes and payment
of dividends to its stockholders.
The Parent is a non-operating holding company,
whose principal assets and sources of income are its
principal U.S. bank subsidiaries—The Bank of New
York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A.—and its other
subsidiaries, including Pershing and the IHC. The
Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
banks, the IHC and other subsidiaries. Therefore, the
Parent primarily relies on dividends, interest,
distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries,
including extensions of credit from the IHC, to meet
its payment obligations, including with respect to its
securities, and to provide funds for share repurchases,
the payment of income taxes and payment of
common and preferred dividends to its stockholders,
to the extent declared by the Board of Directors.
There are various limitations on the extent to which
our banks and other subsidiaries can finance or
otherwise supply funds to the Parent (by dividend or
otherwise) and certain of our affiliates. Each of these
restrictions can reduce the amount of funds available
to meet the Parent’s obligations. Many of our
subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries, are
subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend
payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or
reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to
the Parent or other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank
subsidiaries would not be permitted to distribute a
dividend if doing so would constitute an unsafe and
unsound practice or if the payment would reduce their
capital to an inadequate level. Our subsidiaries may
also choose to restrict dividend payments to the
Parent in order to increase their own capital or
liquidity levels. Our bank subsidiaries are also
subject to restrictions on their ability to lend to or
transact with non-bank affiliates, minimum regulatory
capital and liquidity requirements, and restrictions on
their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank
or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. See
“Supervision and Regulation” and “Results of
Operations – Liquidity and dividends,” as well as
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Further, we evaluate and manage
liquidity on a legal entity basis, which may place
legal and other limitations on our ability to utilize
liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity
requirements of another, including the Parent.
Risk Factors (continued)
102 BNY
There are also limitations specific to the IHC’s ability
to make distributions or extend credit to the Parent.
The IHC is not permitted to make distributions to the
Parent if certain key capital and liquidity indicators
are breached, and if the resolution of the Parent is
imminent, the committed lines of credit provided by
the IHC to the Parent will automatically terminate,
with all outstanding amounts becoming due.
Because the Parent is a holding company, its rights
and the rights of its creditors, including the holders of
its securities, to a share of the assets of any subsidiary
upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the
subsidiary, will be subject to the prior claims of the
subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of our
banking subsidiaries, their depositors) except to the
extent that the Parent may itself be a creditor with
recognized claims against the subsidiary. The rights
of holders of securities issued by the Parent to benefit
from those distributions will also be junior to those
prior claims. Consequently, securities issued by the
Parent will be effectively subordinated to all existing
and future liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Our ability to return capital to shareholders is
subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors
and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and
regulations, including those governing capital and
capital planning, applicable provisions of Delaware
law and our failure to pay full and timely dividends
on our preferred stock.
Holders of our common and preferred stock are only
entitled to receive such dividends or other
distributions of capital as our Board of Directors may
declare out of funds legally available for such
payments. Although we have historically declared
cash dividends on our common and preferred stock,
we are not required to do so. In addition to the Board
of Directors’ approval, our ability to take certain
actions, including our ability to declare dividends or
repurchase our common stock, may be subject to the
buffers under the Federal Reserve’s capital and
TLAC rules. The buffers under the capital rules are
affected by the results of CCAR. Through the CCAR
process, we may be, and have in the past been,
required to resubmit our capital plan in the event of a
deterioration in the general financial markets or
economy or changes in our risk profile (including a
material change in business strategy or risk
exposure), financial condition or corporate structure.
The Federal Reserve is also able, outside the CCAR
process, to restrict our ability to make capital
distributions and subject us to other supervisory or
enforcement actions.
A Federal Reserve determination that our capital
planning processes were weak or otherwise fail to
meet supervisory expectations could have a variety of
adverse consequences, including, without limitation,
ratings downgrades, ongoing heightened supervisory
scrutiny, expenses associated with remediation
activities and potentially an enforcement action.
A failure to increase dividends along with our
competitors, or any reduction of, or elimination of,
our common stock dividend would likely adversely
affect the market price of our common stock, our
return on equity and market perceptions of BNY.
Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our
common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain
exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and
pay in full dividends for the then-current dividend
period (in the case of dividends) or most recently
completed dividend period (in the case of
repurchases) of our Series A preferred stock or the
last preceding dividend period (in the case of
dividends) or most recently completed dividend
period (in the case of repurchases) of our Series F,
Series G, Series H or Series I preferred stock.
In addition, regulatory capital rules that are or will be
applicable to us, including the U.S. capital rules riskbased capital requirements, the SLR, the stress capital
buffer, the enhanced SLR, the TLAC rule and the
U.S. G-SIB surcharge, may limit or otherwise restrict
how we utilize our capital, including common stock
dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us
to increase or alter the mix of our outstanding
regulatory capital instruments. Changes in the
composition of our balance sheet, including as a
result of changing economic conditions and market
values, may further require us to increase or alter the
mix of our outstanding regulatory capital, which in
turn could impact our ability to return capital to
shareholders.
Any requirement to increase our regulatory capital
ratios or alter the composition of our capital could
require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our
business and/or investment plans, which may
negatively affect our financial results. Further, any
requirement to maintain higher levels of capital may
constrain our ability to return capital to shareholders

either in the form of common stock dividends or
stock repurchases.
Any material reduction in our credit ratings or the
credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries,
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A.
or The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, could
increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us
and our rated subsidiaries and have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations and on the value of the
securities we issue.
Our debt and preferred stock and the debt and
deposits of our principal bank subsidiaries, The Bank
of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A. and The
Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, are currently
rated investment grade by the major rating agencies.
These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our
rated subsidiaries. Their credit ratings are based on a
number of factors, including our financial strength,
performance, prospects and operations, as well as
factors not entirely within our control, including
conditions affecting the financial services industry
generally and the U.S. government. Rating agencies
employ different models and formulas to assess the
financial strength of a rated company, and from time
to time rating agencies have, in their discretion,
altered these models. Changes to rating agency
models, general economic conditions, regulatory
developments or other circumstances outside our
control could negatively impact a rating agency’s
judgment of the rating or outlook it assigns to us or
our rated subsidiaries. As a result, we or our rated
subsidiaries may not be able to maintain our
respective credit ratings or outlook on our securities.
For further discussion of our and our principal bank
subsidiaries’ credit ratings, see “Results of Operations
– Liquidity and dividends.”
A material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit
ratings of our rated subsidiaries, which can occur at
any time without notice, could have a material
adverse effect on our access to credit markets, the
related cost of funding and borrowing, our credit
spreads, our liquidity and certain trading revenues,
particularly in those businesses where counterparty
creditworthiness is critical. In addition, in connection
with certain over-the-counter derivatives contracts
and other trading agreements, counterparties may
require us or our rated subsidiaries to provide
additional collateral or to terminate these contracts
and agreements and collateral financing arrangements
in the event of a credit ratings downgrade below
certain ratings levels, which could impair our
liquidity. A downgrade by any one rating agency,
depending on the agency’s relative ratings of the
entity at the time of the downgrade, may have an
impact comparable to the impact of a downgrade by
all rating agencies. If a rating agency downgrade or a
review for downgrade were to occur during broader
market instability, our options for responding to
events may be more limited and more expensive,
possibly significantly. An increase in the costs of our
funding and borrowing, or an impairment of our
liquidity, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. A
material reduction in our credit ratings also could
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us
and adversely affect the value of the securities we
have issued or may issue in the future.
We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may
take, or what actions we may elect or be required to
take in response thereto, which may adversely affect
us. For further discussion on the impact of a credit
rating downgrade, see “Disclosure of contingent
features in OTC derivative instruments” in Note 23 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The application of our Title I preferred resolution
strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly
liquidation authority could adversely affect the
Parent’s liquidity and financial condition and the
Parent’s security holders.
In 2017, in connection with our single point of entry
resolution strategy under Title I of the Dodd-Frank
Act, the Parent entered into a binding support
agreement with certain key subsidiaries to facilitate
the provision of capital and liquidity resources to
them in the event of material financial distress or
failure. The support agreement requires the Parent to
transfer cash and other liquid financial assets to the
IHC on an ongoing basis, subject to certain amounts
retained by the Parent to meet its near-term cash
needs, in exchange for unsecured subordinated
funding notes issued by the IHC as well as a
committed line of credit to the Parent to service its
near-term obligations. The Parent’s and the IHC’s
obligations under the support agreement are secured.
If our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so
severely that resolution of the Parent becomes
imminent, the committed line of credit the IHC
Risk Factors (continued)
104 BNY
provided to the Parent will automatically terminate,
with all amounts outstanding becoming due and
payable, and the support agreement will require the
Parent to transfer most of its remaining assets (other
than stock in subsidiaries and a cash reserve to fund
bankruptcy expenses) to the IHC. As a result, during
a period of severe financial stress, the Parent could
become unable to meet its debt and payment
obligations (including with respect to its securities),
causing the Parent to seek protection under
bankruptcy laws earlier than it otherwise would have.
If the Parent were to become subject to a bankruptcy
proceeding and our single point of entry strategy is
successful, our material entities will not be subject to
insolvency proceedings and their creditors would not
be expected to suffer losses, while the Parent’s
security holders, including unsecured debt holders,
could face significant losses, potentially including the
loss of their entire investment. The single point of
entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only
legal entity to enter resolution proceedings, may
result in greater risk of loss to holders of the Parent’s
unsecured senior debt securities and certain other
securities than would be the case under a different
resolution strategy.
In addition, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act
established an orderly liquidation process in the event
of the failure of a large systemically important
financial institution, such as BNY, in order to avoid
or mitigate serious adverse effects on the U.S.
financial system. Specifically, if the Parent is in
default or danger of default and certain specified
conditions are met, the FDIC may be appointed
receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, and
we would be resolved under that authority instead of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
U.S. supervisors have indicated that a single point of
entry strategy may be a desirable strategy to resolve a
large financial institution such as BNY under Title II
in a manner that would, similar to our preferred
strategy under our Title I resolution plan, impose
losses on shareholders, unsecured debt holders and
other unsecured creditors of the Parent, while
permitting the holding company’s subsidiaries to
continue to operate and remain solvent. Under such a
strategy, assuming the Parent entered resolution
proceedings and its subsidiaries remained solvent,
losses at the subsidiary level would be absorbed by
the Parent and ultimately borne by the Parent’s
security holders (including holders of the Parent’s
unsecured debt securities), while third-party creditors
of the Parent’s subsidiaries would not be expected to
suffer losses. Accordingly, the Parent’s security
holders (including holders of unsecured debt
securities and other unsecured creditors) could face
losses in excess of what otherwise would have been
the case.
Strategic Risk
New lines of business, new products and services or
transformational or strategic project initiatives
subject us to new or additional risks, and the failure
to implement these initiatives could affect our
results of operations.
From time to time, we have launched new lines of
business, offered new products and services within
existing lines of business or undertaken
transformational or strategic projects. There are
substantial risks and uncertainties associated with
these efforts, including with respect to projects that
involve the adoption of new and evolving
technologies such as artificial intelligence. We invest
significant time and resources in developing and
marketing new lines of business, products and
services and executing on our transformational and
strategic initiatives. For example, we have devoted
significant resources to developing new technology
solutions for our clients, including our initiatives
related to real-time electronic payments and global
collateral management, as well as Wove, our
integrative wealth management advisory platform. If
these technology solutions do not operate or perform
as expected, are not successful, or do not produce the
anticipated efficiencies, it could adversely impact our
reputation, business and results of operations.
Developing and providing new products and services,
including those relating to digital assets, increases our
operational risk exposures. These risks are often
heightened for projects that rely on third-party service
providers, or in connection with new technologies
and asset classes, such as digital assets, that are not
only new for BNY but also relatively new to the
financial markets more broadly. Compared with our
activities involving traditional assets, digital assetrelated products or services may introduce
incremental or unique risks, particularly those
associated with cybersecurity exposures and thirdparty dependencies, as well as reputational,
technology, legal and regulatory risks.
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 105
Regulatory requirements can affect whether
initiatives are able to be brought to market in a
manner that is timely and attractive to our customers.
Initial timetables for the development and
introduction of new lines of business or new products
or services and price and profitability targets may not
be met. Furthermore, our revenues and costs may
fluctuate because new businesses or products and
services generally require startup costs while
revenues may take time to develop, which may
adversely impact our results of operations. The
introduction of new accounting or regulatory
requirements, or changes in those requirements, can
also limit our ability to pursue strategic initiatives or
result in significant costs. For example, prior to the
repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, we had
devoted considerable resources in analyzing the
impact of such guidance on our existing and potential
digital asset custody offerings.
Significant effort and resources are necessary to
manage and oversee the successful completion of
transformational or strategic project initiatives. If
management makes choices about these initiatives
that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete,
inaccurate or fraudulent information, fail to
accurately assess the competitive landscape and
industry trends or are unable to address the
expectations of various stakeholders, then the value
and growth prospects of our business may be
affected. Further, these initiatives often place
significant demands on management and a limited
number of employees with subject matter expertise
and may involve significant costs to implement, as
well as increase operational risk as we develop and
implement related controls, processes and procedures
and employees learn to operate under new systems,
controls, processes and procedures. The failure to
successfully execute or monitor these
transformational or strategic initiatives could
adversely impact our business, reputation and results
of operations.
Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also
exist in connection with dealing with new products,
technologies or markets, or clients and customers
whose businesses focus on such products,
technologies or markets, where there is regulatory
uncertainty or different or conflicting regulations
depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction. We
may invest significant time and resources into the
expansion of existing or creation of new compliance
and risk management systems with respect to new
products, technologies or markets.
Our strategic transactions present risks and
uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
From time to time, to achieve our strategic objectives,
we have acquired, disposed of or invested in
(including through joint venture relationships)
companies and businesses and have entered into
strategic alliances or other collaborations with thirdparty service providers to deliver products and
services to clients, and may do so in the future. Our
ability to pursue or complete strategic transactions is
in certain instances subject to regulatory approval and
we cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and
conditions, any required regulatory approvals would
be granted. Moreover, to the extent we pursue a
strategic transaction, there can be no guarantee that
the transaction will close when anticipated, or at all.
If a strategic transaction does not close (including due
to failure to obtain regulatory approval), or if the
strategic transaction fails to deliver anticipated
results, it could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of
operations. Anticipated challenges in obtaining any
required governmental approvals, or uncertainty as to
the prospects for obtaining such approvals, could also
prevent us from pursuing a strategic transaction we
may otherwise view as attractive.
Each acquisition poses integration challenges,
including successfully retaining and assimilating
clients and key employees, capitalizing on certain
revenue synergies and integrating the acquired
company’s employees, culture, control functions,
systems and technology. These risks may be
heightened if we are unable to, or fail to, conduct
sufficient or appropriate due diligence in connection
with a potential acquisition. In some cases,
acquisitions involve entry into new businesses or new
geographic or other markets, and these situations also
present risks and uncertainties in instances where we
may be inexperienced in these new areas. We may be
required to spend a significant amount of time and
resources to integrate these acquisitions. The
anticipated integration benefits may take longer to
achieve than projected and the time and cost needed
to consolidate control functions, platforms and
systems may significantly exceed our estimates. If
we fail to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions,
Risk Factors (continued)
106 BNY
including doing so in a timely and cost-effective
manner, we may not realize the expected benefits,
which could have an adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, we may incur expenses, costs, losses,
penalties, taxes and other liabilities related to the
conduct of the acquired businesses prior to the date of
our ownership (including in connection with the
defense and/or settlement of legal and regulatory
claims, investigations and proceedings) which may
not be recoverable through insurance, indemnification
or otherwise. If the purchase price we pay in an
acquisition exceeds the fair value of assets acquired
less the liabilities we assume, then we may need to
recognize goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill is an intangible asset that is not eligible for
inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable
requirements. Further, if the value of the acquisition
declines, we may be required to record an impairment
charge.
Each disposition also poses challenges, including
separating the disposed businesses, products and
systems in a way that is cost-effective and is not
disruptive to us or our customers. The inherent
uncertainty involved in the process of evaluating,
negotiating or executing a potential sale of one of our
companies or businesses may cause the loss of key
clients, employees, vendors and other business
partners, which could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, a portion of the purchase
price we expect to receive in a disposition may be
contingent or based on an earnout (e.g., dependent on
the profitability or results of operation of the business
over a period of time after the sale is completed). In
such cases, we may not realize all, or any, contingent
or earnout payments we anticipate receiving if the
future performance of the business does not meet our
expectations or if other contingent payment
conditions are not satisfied.
Joint ventures, noncontrolling investments, strategic
alliances and other collaborations contain potentially
increased financial, legal, reputational, operational,
regulatory and/or compliance risks. We may be
dependent on joint venture partners, firms with which
we collaborate, controlling shareholders or
management who may have business interests,
strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
Such dependencies, particularly in the case of
establishing de novo joint ventures, may delay the
launch of a new venture and result in the loss of a
market opportunity. Business decisions or other
actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, the
firms with which we collaborate, controlling
shareholders or management may adversely affect the
value of our investment (or, in the case of strategic
alliances or other collaborations, the value of our
products or services), impact our results of
operations, result in litigation or regulatory action
against us and otherwise damage our reputation and
brand.
We may not realize some or all of the expected
benefits of our transition to a platforms operating
model.
We are executing on a plan to transition our
organization to a platforms operating model. We
expect such transition to lead to operating
efficiencies, process simplification, cost savings, an
increased focus on clients and improvements to the
client experience, infrastructure improvements to
technology and other systems, among other benefits.
Implementing these changes to our operating model
involves various execution challenges, complexities
and uncertainties, may be costly and disruptive to our
business, may result in litigation, regulatory scrutiny,
or other negative financial, strategic or reputational
impacts. Projections regarding the benefits of the
transition are based on current business operations,
market conditions and management expectations,
among other factors, and are subject to change. We
may not be able to obtain the anticipated benefits,
cost savings and operational improvements within the
projected timing or at all. Additionally, we may
experience unintended and unforeseen consequences
as a result of such transition, including a loss of
continuity, increased complexity, issues concerning
employee retention, labor disputes, decreased
employee morale, loss of institutional knowledge and
expertise of departing employees. Such unintended
consequences may increase as the pace of
implementation of our platforms operating model
accelerates or if we are unsuccessful in executing
organizational change management. If we are unable
to successfully implement our transition to a
platforms operating model, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 107
We are subject to competition in all aspects of our
business, which could negatively affect our ability to
maintain or increase our profitability.
The businesses in which we operate are intensely
competitive around the world. Larger and more
geographically diverse companies, and financial
technology firms that invest substantial resources in
developing and designing new technology and that
are not subject to the same level of regulation, may be
able to offer financial products and services at more
competitive prices than we are able to offer. We have
also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue
to experience, pricing and other competitive pressures
in several of our businesses. Pricing pressures, as a
result of the willingness of competitors to offer
comparable or improved products or services at a
lower price, may result in a reduction in the price we
can charge for our products and services, which
could, and in some cases has, negatively affected our
ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
In addition, technological advances have made it
possible for other types of non-depository
institutions, such as financial technology firms,
outsourcing companies and data processing
companies, to offer a variety of products and services
competitive with certain areas of our business,
including with respect to our clearing, settlement,
payments and trading activities. In the future,
financial technology firms may be able to provide
traditional banking products and services by
obtaining a bank-like charter or offer
cryptocurrencies.
Moreover, new or disruptive technologies may
quickly impact markets and the manner in which our
clients interact and transact within markets. For
example, the emergence, adoption and evolution of
new technologies that do not require intermediation,
including distributed ledgers, as well as advances in
robotic process automation, could significantly affect
the competition for payments processing and other
financial services. Our failure to either anticipate, or
participate in, the transformational change within a
given market or adapt these technologies as
successfully as our peers, could make us less
competitive and result in potential negative financial
impact. Increased competition in any of these areas
may require us to make additional capital investments
in our businesses in order to remain competitive.
Furthermore, regulations could impact our ability to
conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective
manner or at all. The more restrictive laws and
regulations applicable to the largest U.S. financial
services institutions, including the U.S. capital rules,
can put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to
both our non-U.S. competitors and U.S. competitors
not subject to the same laws and regulations. See
“Supervision and Regulation.”
Additional Risks
Our businesses may be negatively affected by
adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny or
other reputational harm.
We are subject to reputational, legal, compliance and
regulatory risk in the ordinary course of our business.
Harm to our reputation can result from numerous
sources, including adverse publicity or negative
information, whether or not true, arising from events
occurring at BNY, other financial institutions or in
the financial markets, perceived failure to comply
with legal and regulatory requirements or deliver
appropriate standards of service and quality, or a
failure to appropriately describe our products and
services, how we address environmental, social and
sustainability concerns in our business activities or in
our relationships with clients, the purported
inappropriate or unlawful actions of our employees or
the use of social media by our employees, the
consequences of using emerging technologies, such
as generative artificial intelligence or blockchain
technology, alleged financial reporting irregularities
involving ourselves or other large and well-known
companies and perceived or actual conflicts of
interest. For example, a cybersecurity event
impacting us or our customers’ data could have a
negative impact on our reputation and customer
confidence in BNY and our cybersecurity defenses
and business continuity and resiliency capabilities.
Our reputation could also be harmed by the failure of
an affiliate, joint venture or a vendor or other third
party with which we do business to comply with laws
or regulations. Our reputation may be significantly
damaged by adverse publicity or negative information
regarding BNY, whether or not true, that may be
published or broadcast by the media or posted on
social media, non-mainstream news services or other
internet forums. The speed and pervasiveness with
which information, misinformation or rumors can be
disseminated through these channels, in particular
social media, may magnify risks relating to negative
Risk Factors (continued)
108 BNY
publicity or media scrutiny. Damage to our
reputation could affect the confidence of clients,
rating agencies, regulators, employees, stockholders
and other stakeholders and could in turn have an
impact on our business and results of operations.
Additionally, governmental scrutiny from regulators,
tax authorities, legislative bodies and law
enforcement agencies with respect to financial
services companies has remained at elevated levels.
Press coverage and other public statements, including
information posted on social media or other internet
forums, that allege some form of wrongdoing
(including, in some cases, press coverage and public
statements that do not directly involve BNY) often
result in some type of investigation or in lawsuits.
Certain enforcement authorities have recently
required admissions of wrongdoing, and in some
cases, criminal pleas, as part of the resolution of
matters brought by them against financial institutions.
Any such resolution of a matter involving BNY could
lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could
adversely affect our reputation and ability to do
business in certain products and in certain
jurisdictions and could have other negative effects.
Impacts from geopolitical events, acts of terrorism,
war, natural disasters, the physical effects of climate
change, pandemics and other similar events may
have a negative impact on our business and
operations.
In conducting our business and maintaining and
supporting our global operations, which includes
clients, counterparties, vendors and other third
parties, we are subject to risks of loss from the
outbreak of war, escalation or continuation of
hostilities, global conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural
disasters, the physical effects of climate change,
pandemics and other similar unpredictable or
catastrophic events that could have a negative impact
on our business and operations. For example, in July
2024, a software update by CrowdStrike Holdings,
Inc. (“CrowdStrike”), a cybersecurity technology
company, caused widespread crashes of the Windows
systems into which it was integrated resulting in
operational disruptions to a variety of sectors
including aviation, financial services and healthcare.
Although we have not experienced any material
impacts as a result of the CrowdStrike software
update or similar events, we could in the future
experience similar third-party software-induced
interruptions to our operations, which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We may also be impacted by unfavorable
political, economic, legal or other developments, in
addition to social or political instability, changes in
governmental policies or policies of central banks,
sanctions, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation
of assets, price, capital and exchange controls, the
imposition of tariffs, counter tariffs or other
limitations on international trade and travel, which
could disrupt world trade and lead to trade retaliation
and other supply chain complications, and changes in
laws and regulations. These risks may be heightened
as a result of uncertainties about changing rules,
regulations and policies following the outcome of
recent elections and the resulting political
administration transitions in the United States and
internationally.
For example, as a result of Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, we ceased
originating new banking business in Russia and
suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. An escalation or continuation of
hostilities, the imposition of additional sanctions or
other laws prohibiting or limiting operations in
certain jurisdictions or an elevated volume and
complexity of cyberattacks as a result of the conflict
in Ukraine, or conflicts or tensions in other regions
such as the Middle East, could lead to unexpected
disruptions to our businesses and could adversely
affect the global economy and financial markets
generally, diminish levels of economic activity and
increase volatility in commodity prices, credit and
capital markets. The extent and duration of any such
military action, and the responses to such action by
governments, central banks and the markets, are
difficult to predict and may magnify the impact of
other risks described in this section.
Our operations, business, clients, supply chain and
other stakeholders, as well as the finance sector and
the global economy, could be adversely affected by
the physical manifestations of climate change.
Climate-related physical risks include the increased
frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as
hurricanes, floods, heatwaves and wildfires, and
chronic shifts in the climate, such as increases in
average global temperatures, rising sea levels,
persistent changes in precipitation levels, prolonged
drought, food and water insecurity, and any resulting
population migration. Such changes could have
adverse financial, operational and other impacts on
us, both directly on our business, operations and
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 109
employees, and indirectly as a result of impacts to our
clients, vendors and other third parties on which we
rely or as a result of market volatility. These risks,
and the impact on our business and the business of
our clients and counterparties, are often difficult to
predict or quantify. Climate change risks can also
lead to a deterioration in our credit risk exposures, for
example, in our wealth management mortgage and
commercial real estate portfolios. Further, our
headquarters is located in New York near the Hudson
River waterfront. Such location and the location of
our other properties may subject us to more frequent
or severe weather events, which could lead to
declines in the asset values of our properties and the
reduced availability or increased cost of insurance.
While we have business continuity and disaster
recovery plans in place, catastrophic events, whether
or not caused by climate change, could damage our
facilities, disrupt or delay for prolonged periods
normal business operations (including
communications, technology and physical access to
our facilities) or result in harm to or cause travel
limitations on our employees, with a similar impact
on our clients, suppliers and counterparties.
Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business
continuity and disaster recovery plans, to the extent a
catastrophic event occurs and our business continuity
and disaster recovery plans fail or are otherwise
impaired, for example, because of an internal or
external failure of our information technology
infrastructure or increased rates of employee illness
or unavailability, our business continuity status would
be adversely impacted, our ability to service and
interact with our clients may suffer and there would
be a disruption to our businesses.
Catastrophic events, including those caused by
climate change, could also negatively impact the
purchase of our products and services if those events
result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset
price levels or disruptions in general economic
activity, or in financial market settlement functions,
which could negatively impact our business and
results of operations. In addition, such catastrophic
events may lead, and in some cases have led, to
higher market volatility, reduced availability or
increased cost of insurance for our clients, as well as
an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults
that could result in our experiencing higher levels of
nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions
for credit losses, negatively impacting our business
and operations. Furthermore, we invest in renewable
energy projects, which have been and may in the
future be adversely affected by extreme weather
events, natural disasters and other catastrophic events.
Sustainability concerns, including a focus on
climate change and diversity, could adversely affect
our business, affect client activity levels, subject us
to additional regulatory requirements and damage
our reputation.
Global efforts to mitigate climate damage, support
climate adaptation, slow the loss of biodiverse natural
ecosystems and promote other sustainability causes
and standards have led and are likely to continue to
lead to new legislative and regulatory requirements,
heightened expectations among regulators and
supervisors, and changes in consumers’ and
businesses’ behaviors and business preferences.
Conversely, there has been increasing sentiment
against climate and diversity initiatives in the U.S.,
which has led and is likely to continue to lead to new
policies and legislative and regulatory requirements
discouraging or prohibiting these initiatives. As a
result, we may face heightened, and potentially
conflicting, regulatory, legal and reputational scrutiny
in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions in which
we operate, and our business and financial condition
may be adversely impacted.
The governmental and supervisory focus on these and
other sustainability-related issues has resulted and
could continue to result in our becoming subject to
new, conflicting or heightened regulatory
requirements or supervisory guidance, such as
requirements relating to risk management, operational
resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress
scenarios, or additional, potentially costly, reporting
requirements. In particular, financial institutions
have come under increased scrutiny regarding the
management and disclosure of climate risks, both
directly and indirectly, and new regulations may
expand required disclosure of actual and potential
climate-related impact on suppliers, clients and other
third parties in our value chain. For example, in
October 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the
FDIC jointly issued interagency guidance for large
financial institutions, including BNY, on principles
for climate-related financial risk management, and
California enacted three climate-related laws
imposing extensive new climate-related disclosure
obligations applicable to companies doing business in
California, and in 2024, made updates to two of those
laws. In 2024, the SEC also adopted rules requiring
Risk Factors (continued)
110 BNY
enhanced disclosures of certain climate-related risks,
which was stayed pending litigation. On the other
hand, certain states in which we operate have enacted,
or have proposed to enact, statutes that prohibit
financial institutions from denying or canceling
products or services to a person, or otherwise
discriminating against a person in making available
products or services, on the basis of social credit
scores and certain other factors. There is also shifting
sentiment in the U.S. against climate, sustainability
and diversity programs and initiatives at the federal
level, with executive orders directing federal agencies
to eliminate programs, grants and mandates that
support diversity, equity, inclusion or environmental
goals. Any changes in regulatory requirements,
including as a result of changes in policies from
federal, state or non-U.S. lawmakers and regulators,
could result in increased regulatory, compliance or
other costs or higher capital requirements, and may
subject us to diverging and evolving requirements in
the various jurisdictions in which we operate,
including potentially conflicting sustainability and
anti-sustainability requirements and expectations
from local, state and national governments that may
impact our ability to conduct certain business within
those jurisdictions.
Our Investment Management line of business offers a
range of solutions and advice for professional and
personal investors to better manage risk-adjusted
returns and, where applicable, achieve their
sustainable investment goals and invest responsibly.
Certain lawmakers and public officials have
suggested that sustainability-related investing
practices may result in violations of antitrust laws and
breaches of fiduciary duty. In addition, we may face
compliance risks presented by regulations that are
intended to address “greenwashing” or
“greenhushing,” including the UK FCA Sustainability
Disclosure Requirements and other regulations that
may be promulgated in the future. We have in the
past been, and may in the future become, subject to
enforcement actions and investigations by the SEC
and other regulators and government officials,
including state Attorneys General, regarding our
sustainability-related investing practices.
Governmental enforcement action could also lead to
civil litigation claims by clients, fund shareholders
and other third parties asserting violations of law or
breaches of fiduciary duties and contractual
obligations.
Further, as some regulators seek to mandate
additional disclosure of sustainability-related
information, our ability to comply with such
requirements and to conduct more robust risk-related
analyses may be hampered by lack of information and
reliable data. Climate data, particularly greenhouse
gas emissions for clients and direct and indirect
counterparties, may be limited in availability, based
on estimated or unverified figures, which may have
been derived from information or factors released by
third-party sources, collected and reported on a lag,
and variable in quality and consistency. Moreover,
the methodologies and standards used to measure and
report such data are still in early stages, rapidly
evolving and subject to change. In addition,
modeling capabilities to analyze climate-related risks
remain incomplete and there can be no assurance that
accurate or effective predictive tools or capabilities
will be developed. These and other factors could
cause results to differ materially from those expressed
in the estimates and beliefs made by third parties and
by us, which could also impact our management of
risk in this area and could result in us amending or
restating our sustainability targets or baselines,
including those related to greenhouse gas emissions,
carbon neutrality, diversion of waste from landfills,
paper neutrality and water consumption.
In the transition to a low carbon economy, changes in
public policy, regulatory environment, stakeholder
preferences, market pressures and advancements in
technology may affect our business practices or result
in additional costs or other adverse consequences to
our business operations. Such changes could affect
whether and on what terms and conditions we will
engage in certain activities or offer certain products
or services. Failure to adequately consider transition
risks in developing and executing on our business
strategy could lead to a loss of market share, lower
revenues, decreased asset values and higher credit
costs, as well as regulatory scrutiny.
Views about sustainability are diverse and changing,
and our business, reputation and ability to attract and
retain clients and employees may be harmed if our
actions are perceived to be ineffective, insufficient or
otherwise inappropriate, or if we are unable to
achieve our stated objectives and commitments.
Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result
of our association, whether actual or perceived, with,
among others, certain industries, companies,
individuals or products perceived to be causing or
exacerbating climate change or contributing to other
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 111
sustainability issues. We are also exposed to
reputational risk resulting from potential allegations
of discrimination against companies in certain
sectors, as well as any decisions we make to continue
to conduct or change our activities in response to
considerations relating to climate change or other
sustainability issues. At the same time, certain
financial institutions have also been subject to
criticism and negative publicity as a result of their
decisions to reduce their involvement in certain
industries or projects perceived to be causing or
exacerbating climate change or contributing to other
sustainability issues. Further, political pressure may
be placed upon governmental clients not to use
certain providers, such as us, if the legislators or
governmental officials in such jurisdictions believe
our positions are not consistent with the views of
such legislators or officials. The continuously
evolving societal and political perspectives on
sustainability make the ultimate impact on us difficult
to predict, identify and monitor and may be
detrimental to us.
Tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions
with respect to historical transactions may adversely
affect our net income, effective tax rate and our
overall results of operations and financial condition.
In the course of our business, we receive inquiries
and challenges from both U.S. and non-U.S. tax
authorities on the amount of taxes we owe. If we are
not successful in defending these inquiries and
challenges, we may be required to adjust the timing
or amount of taxable income or deductions or the
allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of
which can require a greater provision for taxes or
otherwise negatively affect earnings. Probabilities
and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and
adjustments to the reserves are made, when
necessary, but the reserves may prove inadequate
because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the
outcome of any challenge, settlement or litigation or
the extent to which it will negatively affect us or our
business. Future tax laws or the expiration of or
changes in existing tax laws, or the interpretation of
those laws worldwide, could also have a material
impact on our business or net income. Our actions
taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes
in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a
manner that may result in lower earnings. In
addition, upon any change in tax law, we must
recognize the effect of the change on our deferred tax
assets and liabilities. An increase in the U.S. tax rate
would likely result in an increase in our net deferred
tax liabilities and a reduction in our net income in the
period of enactment of the change. In addition,
changes in tax rates or tax law could also impact the
method and amount of capital that we return to
shareholders. See Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.
Changes in accounting standards governing the
preparation of our financial statements and future
events could have a material impact on our reported
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and other financial data.
From time to time, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and bank
regulators change the financial accounting and
reporting standards governing the preparation of our
financial statements or the interpretation of those
standards. These changes are difficult to predict and
can materially impact how we record and report our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and other financial data. In some cases, the FASB,
the SEC and bank regulators may change financial
accounting and reporting standards governing the
preparation of our financial statements or the
interpretation of those standards that may require us
to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively,
potentially resulting in the restatement of our prior
period financial statements and our related
disclosures.
Additionally, our accounting policies and methods are
fundamental to how we record and report our
financial condition and results of operations. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
based upon assumptions and use judgments and
models about future economic and market conditions,
which affect reported amounts and related disclosures
in our financial statements. Amounts subject to
estimates are items such as the allowance for credit
losses, goodwill and other intangibles and litigation
and regulatory contingencies. Among other effects,
such changes in estimates could result in further
impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and
establishment of allowances for credit losses as well
as litigation and regulatory contingencies. In
performing our annual and interim goodwill
impairment tests, we may use an income approach to
estimate the fair values of each reporting unit.
Estimated cash flows used in the income approach are
Risk Factors (continued)

based on management’s projections. Estimated cash
flows extend far into the future, and, by their nature,
are difficult to estimate over such an extended time
frame. Factors that may significantly affect the cash
flow estimates include, among others, market values
of assets we manage, the level and mix of those
assets, customer behaviors and attrition, operating
margins, changes in revenue growth trends, certain
money market fee waiver practices, cost structures
and technology, regulatory and legislative changes,
specific industry or market sector conditions,
competition and changes in interest rates. In the
future, small changes in the assumptions, such as
changes in the cash flow estimates, discount rate or
long-term growth rate, or a prolonged
macroeconomic downturn may produce a material
non-cash goodwill impairment. If actual or
subsequent events occur that are materially different
than the assumptions, judgments and estimates we
used, our results of operation may be materially and
negatively impacted.

The following accounting guidance issued by FASB
has not yet been adopted as of Dec. 31, 2024.
ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income
Tax Disclosures, which requires a company to
disclose, on an annual basis, additional disaggregated
information related to the existing disclosures for the
effective income tax rate reconciliation and income
taxes paid.
This ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with a
retrospective option, for annual periods beginning
after Dec. 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after Dec. 15, 2025. BNY is
currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on
the income tax disclosures.
Recent Accounting Developments

Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP
financial measures
BNY has included in this Annual Report certain NonGAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude
goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax
liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible
common equity – Non-GAAP is additional useful
information for investors because it presents a
measure of those assets that can generate income, and
the tangible book value per common share – NonGAAP is additional useful information because it
presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.
BNY included revenue measures excluding notable
items, including a net loss from repositioning the
securities portfolio, the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable and disposal
gains and losses. Expense measures, excluding
notable items, including goodwill impairment, FDIC
special assessment, severance expense and litigation
reserves, are also presented. Litigation reserves
represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude
standard business-related legal fees. Income before
taxes, net income applicable to common shareholders
of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation,
diluted earnings per share, return on common equity,
return on tangible common equity and pre-tax
operating margin, excluding the notable items
mentioned above, are also provided. These measures
are provided to permit investors to view the financial
measures on a basis consistent with how management
views the businesses.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant
currency basis permits investors to assess the
significance of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were
determined by applying the current period foreign
currency exchange rates to the prior period revenue.
We believe that this presentation, as a supplement to
GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture
of the related revenue results without the variability
caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.
BNY has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating
margin for the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, net of distribution and servicing
expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe
that this measure is useful when evaluating the
performance of the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment relative to industry
competitors.
Forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures
From time to time we may present or discuss
forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures, such
as targets for expenses excluding notable items. We
are unable to provide a reconciliation of forwardlooking Non-GAAP financial measures to the
comparable GAAP financial measures because we are
unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a
meaningful or accurate estimation of amounts that
would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the
inherent difficulty of quantifying future amounts or
when they may occur. Such unavailable information
could be significant to future results.

results or occurrences, are inherently uncertain and
are based upon current beliefs and expectations of
future events, many of which are, by their nature,
difficult to predict, outside of our control and subject
to change. By identifying these statements in this
manner, we are alerting investors to the possibility
that our actual results may differ, possibly materially,
from the anticipated results expressed or implied in
these forward-looking statements as a result of a
number of important factors, including those factors
described in “Risk Factors,” such as:
• errors or delays in our operational and transaction
processing, or those of third parties, may
materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and reputation;
• our risk management framework, policies and

materially adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition;
• limitations of the models we use to measure,
monitor and manage risk could lead to
unexpected losses and adverse business impacts;
• a communications or technology disruption or
failure within our infrastructure or the

Glossary
BNY 123
Management of BNY is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for BNY, as such term is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
BNY’s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, has assessed
the effectiveness of BNY’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).
Based upon such assessment, management believes
that, as of December 31, 2024, BNY’s internal
control over financial reporting is effective based
upon those criteria.
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm that audited BNY’s 2024 financial
statements included in this Annual Report under
“Financial Statements” and “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements,” has issued a report with
respect to the effectiveness of BNY’s internal control
over financial reporting. This report begins on page
125.
Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
124 BNY
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and subsidiaries’ (BNY) internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, BNY
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024,
based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of BNY as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial
statements), and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
BNY’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of
Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on BNY’s
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the
PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to BNY in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws
and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting
was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and
testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
BNY 125
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may
become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (and its subsidiaries)
134 BNY
Note 1–Summary of significant accounting
and reporting policies
In this Annual Report, references to “our,” “we,”
“us,” “BNY,” the “Company” and similar terms refer
to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and its
consolidated subsidiaries. The term “Parent” refers to
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation but not
its subsidiaries.
Nature of operations
BNY is a global leader in providing a broad range of
financial products and services in domestic and
international markets. Through our three principal
business segments, Securities Services, Market and
Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, we serve institutions, corporations and
high-net-worth individuals. See Note 24 for the
primary products and services of our lines of business
and other information.
Basis of presentation
The accounting and financial reporting policies of
BNY, a global financial services company, conform
to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) and prevailing industry practices.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented have been made.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates based upon assumptions about future
economic and market conditions which affect
reported amounts and related disclosures in our
financial statements. Our most significant estimates
pertain to our allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Although our current estimates
contemplate current conditions and how we expect
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible
that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated
in those estimates, which could materially affect our
results of operations and financial condition.
Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the rate of
exchange on the balance sheet date. Translation gains
and losses on investments in foreign entities with
functional currencies that are not the U.S. dollar are
recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments
in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Revenue
and expense transactions are translated at the
applicable daily rate or the weighted average monthly
exchange rate when applying the daily rate is not
practical. For transactions that are denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency, the
effects of exchange rate changes are included in
foreign exchange revenue in the income statement.
Acquisitions and divestitures
The income statement and balance sheet include
results of acquired businesses accounted for under the
acquisition method of accounting pursuant to
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805,
Business Combinations, and equity investments from
the dates of acquisition. Contingent purchase
consideration is measured at its fair value and
recorded on the purchase date. Any subsequent
changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration
liability are recorded to other noninterest expense.
Gains or losses on divested business are reflected in
investment and other revenue. For businesses that are
determined to be held-for-sale and the fair value less
costs to sell is less than its carrying value, a loss is
recognized for that difference. Contingent
consideration received is measured at fair value and
recorded at the date of sale. Any subsequent changes
in the fair value of a contingent consideration
receivable are recorded to investment and other
revenue.
Consolidation
We evaluate an entity for possible consolidation in
accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation. We first
determine whether or not we have variable interests
in the entity, which are investments or other interests
that absorb portions of an entity’s expected losses or
receive portions of the entity’s expected returns. Our
variable interests may include decision-maker or
service provider fees, direct and indirect investments
and investments made by related parties, including
related parties under common control. If it is
determined that we do not have a variable interest in
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
BNY 135
the entity, no further analysis is required and the
entity is not consolidated.
If we hold a variable interest in the entity, further
analysis is performed to determine if the entity is a
variable interest entity (“VIE”) or a voting model
entity (“VME”).
We consider the underlying facts and circumstances
of individual entities when assessing whether or not
an entity is a VIE. An entity is determined to be a
VIE if the equity investors:
• do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity
to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support; or
• lack one or more of the following characteristics
of a controlling financial interest:
• the power, through voting rights or similar
rights, to direct the activities of an entity that
most significantly impact the entity’s
economic performance;
• the obligation to absorb the expected losses
of the entity; and
• the right to receive the expected residual
returns of the entity.
We reconsider and reassess whether or not we are the
primary beneficiary of a VIE when governing
documents or contractual arrangements are changed
that would reallocate the obligation to absorb
expected losses or receive expected residual returns
between BNY and the other investors. This could
occur when BNY disposes of any portion of its
variable interests in the VIE, when we acquire
additional variable interests in the VIE, when
additional variable interests are issued to other
investors or when other investors liquidate their
variable interest in the VIE.
We consolidate a VIE if it is determined that we have
a controlling financial interest in the entity. We have
a controlling financial interest in a VIE when we have
both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE
that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or
the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could
potentially be significant to that VIE.
For entities that do not meet the definition of a VIE,
the entity is considered a VME. We consolidate these
entities if we can exert control over the financial and
operating policies of an investee, which typically
occurs if we have a 50% or more voting interest in the
entity.
See Note 14 for additional disclosures related to our
variable interests.
Equity method investments
Equity investments of less than a majority but at least
20% ownership or where we are deemed to have
significant influence are accounted for by the equity
method and included in other assets. Earnings on
these investments are reflected as investment services
fees, investment management and performance fees
or investment and other revenue, as appropriate, in
the period earned.
A loss in value of an equity investment that is
determined to be other-than-temporary is recognized
by reducing the carrying value of the equity
investment to its fair value.
Effective in 2024, but applied retrospectively, the
Company’s investments in renewable energy projects
through limited liability companies are accounted for
using the proportional amortization method, when
certain established criteria are met. Previously, these
investments were accounted for as equity method
investments utilizing the hypothetical liquidation at
book value approach. See “Tax credit investments”
below for information on the proportional
amortization method. See Note 2 for additional
information on the impact of adopting the new
accounting guidance for the amount of our renewable
energy investments.
Below are our most significant equity method
investments.

bearing deposits with banks on the balance sheet and
with cash and due from banks when reconciling the
beginning and end-of-period balances on the
consolidated statement of cash flows.
Securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities sold under repurchase agreements are
accounted for as collateralized financings. Generally,
these agreements are recorded at the amounts at
which the securities will be subsequently resold or
repurchased, plus accrued interest.
Securities purchased under resale agreements are
fully collateralized with high-quality liquid securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and additional
collateral is received or provided, as required. As
such, these transactions carry minimal credit risk and
are generally not allocated an allowance for credit
losses.
Where an enforceable netting agreement exists, resale
and repurchase agreements executed with the same
counterparty and the same maturity date are reported
on a net basis on the balance sheet.
Securities – Debt
Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale,
held-to-maturity or trading securities when they are
purchased. Debt securities are classified as availablefor-sale when we intend to hold them for an indefinite
period of time or when they may be used for tactical
asset/liability purposes and may be sold from time to
time to effectively manage interest rate exposure,
prepayment risk and liquidity needs. Debt securities
are classified as held-to-maturity when we intend and
have the ability to hold them until maturity. Debt
securities are classified as trading when we intend to
resell them.
Available-for-sale securities are measured at fair
value. The difference between fair value and
amortized cost representing unrealized gains or losses
is recorded net of tax as an addition to, or deduction
from, OCI, unless an expected credit loss is
recognized. Realized gains and losses on sales of
available-for-sale securities are reported in
investment and other revenue on the income
statement. The cost of debt securities sold is
determined on a specific identification method. Heldto-maturity securities are measured at amortized cost,
net of expected credit loss, if any.
From time to time our intention to hold available-forsale securities has changed such that we intend, and
have the ability, to hold the securities to maturity.
Transfers of securities from available-for-sale to heldto-maturity are accounted for at fair value and create
a new cost basis. The unrealized gains or losses at
date of transfer continue to be recorded in
accumulated OCI and are subsequently amortized
into net interest income over the contractual lives of
the securities.
The Company’s policy for recognition of expected
credit losses for securities available-for-sale and
securities held-to-maturity is contained within
“Allowance for credit losses – Securities – Debt” and
“Allowance for credit losses – Other” below.
Trading securities are measured at fair value and
included in trading assets on the balance sheet.
Trading revenue, which is reflected in investment and
other revenue, includes both realized and unrealized
gains and losses. The liability incurred on short-sale
transactions, representing the obligation to deliver
securities, is included in trading liabilities at fair
value.
Income on securities purchased is adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discount on
a level yield basis, generally over their contractual
life.
Debt securities that are beneficial interests in
securitized financial assets and are not high credit
quality are discounted at the current yield used to
accrete the beneficial interest. A credit loss is
recognized when there is an adverse change in
expected cash flows.
If we intend to sell a debt security or it is more likely
than not that we will be required to sell a debt
security prior to recovery of its cost basis, the security
is written down to fair value and the credit and noncredit components of the unrealized loss are
recognized in earnings and subsequently accreted to
interest income on an effective yield basis over the
life of the security. Subsequent increases in the fair
value of the security after the write-down are
included in OCI.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 137
Securities – Equity
Investments in equity securities that do not result in
consolidation and are not accounted for under the
equity method are measured at fair value with
changes in the fair value recognized through earnings,
unless one of two available exceptions applies. The
first exception, a scope exception, allows Federal
Reserve Bank stock, Federal Home Loan Bank stock
and exchange memberships to remain accounted for
at cost, less impairment. The second practicability
exception is an election available for equity
investments that do not have readily determinable fair
values. For certain investments where the Company
has chosen the practicability exception, such
investments are accounted for in other assets on the
balance sheet at cost adjusted for impairment, if any,
plus or minus observable price changes in orderly
transactions for an identical or similar investment of
the same issuer with any such changes reflected in
investment and other revenue. Equity securities with
readily determinable fair values are classified in
trading assets with changes in fair value reflected in
other trading revenue, which is included in
investment and other revenue in the consolidated
income statement.
Loans
Loans are reported at amortized cost, net of any
unearned income and deferred fees and costs. Certain
loan origination and upfront commitment fees, as
well as certain direct loan origination and
commitment costs, are deferred and amortized as a
yield adjustment over the lives of the related loans.
Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or
fair value.
Loan modifications
A loan may be modified if the debtor is experiencing
financial difficulties and the modification results in
more than an insignificant delay in payment. A
determination of whether a debtor is experiencing
financial difficulty is based on payment status, and
for commercial borrowers, the determination also
considers debtor risk ratings. The determination of
whether the modification results in more than an
insignificant delay in payment is based on analysis of
the payment amount subject to delay, the time span of
the modified terms, as well as a review of
modification activity in the previous 12-month
period.
Credit losses related to modified loans are generally
accounted for under an individual evaluation
methodology (see “Allowance for credit losses”
below).
Nonperforming assets
Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status
when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more,
or when there is reasonable doubt that interest or
principal will be collected.
When a first or second lien residential mortgage loan
reaches 90 days delinquent, it is subject to an
individual evaluation of credit loss and placed on
nonaccrual status.
When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,
previously accrued and uncollected interest is
reversed against current period interest income.
Interest receipts on nonaccrual loans are recognized
as interest income or are applied to principal when we
believe the ultimate collectability of principal is in
doubt. Nonaccrual loans generally are restored to an
accrual basis when principal and interest become
current and remain current for a specified period.
“Allowance for credit losses” below provides
additional information regarding the individual
evaluation of credit losses for nonperforming loans.
Allowance for credit losses
The accounting policy for determining the allowances
has been identified as a “critical accounting estimate”
as it requires us to make numerous complex and
subjective estimates and assumptions relating to
amounts which are judgmental and inherently
uncertain.
The allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the expected contractual life of the financial
instruments as of the balance sheet date. The
allowance methodology is designed to provide
procedural discipline in assessing the appropriateness
of the allowance.
A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses. The qualitative framework is described
in further detail within “Allowance for credit losses –
Other” below. The quantitative component of our
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
138 BNY
estimate uses models and methodologies that
categorize financial assets based on product type,
collateral type, and other credit trends and risk
characteristics, including relevant information about
past events, current conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions
that affect the collectability of the recorded amounts.
The allowance may be determined using various
methods, including discounted cash flow methods,
loss-rate methods, probability of default methods or
other methods that we determine to be appropriate.
We estimate our expected credit losses using the
probability of default method for the majority of our
financial assets. We measure expected credit losses
of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis when
similar risk characteristics exist. For a financial asset
that does not share risk characteristics with other
assets, expected credit losses are measured based on
an individual evaluation method.
In our estimate, with the exception of our small home
equity line of credit portfolio, available-for-sale debt
securities, and individually evaluated financial assets,
we utilize a multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast
which includes a weighting of three scenarios: a
baseline and upside and downside scenarios and
allows us to develop our estimate using a wide span
of economic variables. Our baseline scenario reflects
a view on likely performance of each global region
and the other two scenarios are designed relative to
the baseline scenario. This approach incorporates a
reasonable and supportable forecast period spanning
the life of the asset, and this period includes both an
initial estimated economic outlook component as well
as a reversion component for each economic input
variable. The length of each of the two components
depends on the underlying financial instrument,
scenario and underlying economic input variable. In
general, the initial economic outlook period for each
economic input variable under each scenario ranges
between several months and two years. The speed at
which the scenario-specific forecasts revert to longterm historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On a quarterly basis, within a
developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook.
Allowance for credit losses – Loans and lendingrelated commitments
The allowance for credit losses on loans is presented
as a valuation allowance to loans, and the allowance
for credit losses on lending-related commitments is
recorded in other liabilities. The components of the
allowance for credit losses on loans and lendingrelated commitments consist of the following three
elements:
• a pooled allowance component for higher riskrated and pass-rated commercial and institutional
credits and loans secured by commercial real
estate;
• a pooled allowance component for residential
mortgage loans; and
• an asset-specific allowance component involving
individually evaluated credits of $1 million or
greater which no longer share risk characteristics
with other loans.
The first element, a pooled allowance component for
higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and
institutional credits and loans secured by commercial
real estate, is based on our expected credit loss model
using the probability of default method, which has
been adjusted for the forecast of economic conditions.
Individual credit analyses are performed on such
loans before being assigned a credit rating.
Segmentation is established based on risk
characteristics of the loans and how risk is monitored.
In estimating the terms of the exposures and resulting
effect on the measurement of expected credit loss, we
consider the impact of potential prepayments as well
as the effect of borrower extension options. Borrower
ratings are reviewed at least annually and are mapped
to third-party databases, including rating agency and
default and recovery databases, to support ongoing
consistency and validity. Higher risk-rated loans and
lending-related commitments are reviewed quarterly.
For the higher-risk rated and pass-rated commercial
and institutional credits, the loss expected in each
loan incorporates the borrower’s credit rating, facility
rating and maturity. The loss given default, derived
from the facility rating, incorporates a recovery
expectation, and for unfunded lending exposures, an
estimate of the use of the facility at default (usage
given default). The borrower’s probability of default
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 139
is derived from the associated credit rating. The
probability of default and the loss given default are
applied to the estimated facility amount at default to
determine the quantitative component of the
allowance. For each of the different parameters,
specific credit models are developed for each segment
of our portfolio, including commercial loans and
lease financing, financial institutions and other. We
use both internal and external data in the development
of these parameters.
For loans secured by commercial real estate, a
separate modeled approach is used that considers
collateral specific data and loan maturity, as well as
commercial real estate market factors by geographical
region and property type under different
macroeconomic scenarios. A statistical method is
used to simulate the property value and income of
each property, and to estimate the probability of
default, loss given default and expected credit loss for
each loan. The model outputs are established by
using a baseline, upside and downside
macroeconomic scenario to generate projected
property values and incomes.
The second element, a pooled allowance component
for residential mortgage loans, is determined by first
segregating our mortgage pools into two categories:
(i) our wealth management mortgages and other
residential mortgages purchased primarily in 2023
and (ii) our legacy mortgage portfolio disclosed as
other residential mortgages. We then apply models to
each portfolio to predict prepayments, default rates
and loss severity. We consider historical loss
experience and use a loan-level, multi-period default
model which further segments each portfolio by
product type, including first lien fixed rate mortgages,
first lien adjustable rate mortgages, second lien
mortgages and interest-only mortgages. We calculate
the mortgage loss up to loan contractual maturity and
embed a reasonable and supportable forecast and
macroeconomic variable inputs which are described
above. For home equity lines of credit, probability of
default and loss given default are based on external
data from third-party databases due to the small size
of the portfolio and limited internal data. Our legacy
mortgage portfolio and home equity line of credit
portfolios represent small sub-segments of our
mortgage loans.
The third element, individually evaluated credits, is
based on individual analysis of loans of $1 million
and greater which no longer share risk characteristics
with other loans. Factors we consider in measuring
the extent of expected credit loss include the payment
status, collateral value, the borrower’s financial
condition, guarantor support, the probability of
collecting scheduled principal and interest payments
when due, modifications of payment structure or term
for troubled borrowers, and recoveries if they can be
reasonably estimated. We measure the expected
credit loss as the difference between the amortized
cost basis of the loan and the present value of the
expected future cash flows from the borrower which
is generally discounted at the loan’s effective interest
rate, or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is
collateral dependent. We generally individually
evaluate nonperforming loans as well as loans that
have been modified given the risk characteristics of
such loans.
Allowance for credit losses – Securities – Debt
When estimating expected credit losses, we segment
our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt
securities portfolios by major asset class. This is
influenced by whether the security is structured or
non-structured (i.e., direct obligation), as well as the
issuer type.
For available-for-sale debt securities with an
unrealized loss at the balance sheet date, if we
determine that a credit loss exists, the amount is
recognized as an allowance for credit losses in
securities – available-for-sale, with a corresponding
adjustment to the provision for credit losses. We
evaluate credit losses at the individual security level
and do not recognize credit losses if the fair value
exceeds amortized cost, and if we determine that a
credit loss exists, we limit the recognition of the loss
to the difference between fair value and amortized
cost. In our determination of whether an expected
credit loss exists for a non-structured security, we
routinely conduct periodic reviews and examine
various quantitative and qualitative factors that are
unique to each portfolio, including the severity of the
unrealized loss position, agency rating, credit
enhancement, cash flow deterioration and other
factors. For a structured security, a credit loss model
is utilized and the components of the credit loss
calculation for each major portfolio or asset class
include a probability of default and loss given default
(severity). These values depend on forecasted
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment that are incorporated into our baseline
forecast scenario described in “Allowance for credit
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
140 BNY
losses” above. Generally, cash flows are discounted
at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt
security. Changes to the present value of cash flows
due to the passage of time are recognized within the
allowance for credit losses.
We estimate expected credit losses for held-tomaturity debt securities using a similar multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast methodology as described in
“Allowance for credit losses” above. The allowance
for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities is
recorded in securities – held-to-maturity. The
components of the modeled credit loss calculation for
each major portfolio or asset class include a
probability of default and loss given default and their
values depend on the forecast behavior of variables in
the macroeconomic environment. For structured debt
securities, we estimated expected credit losses at the
individual security level and use a cash flow model to
project principal losses. Generally, cash flows are
discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the
debt security. The difference is reflected in the
allowance for credit losses, and changes to the present
value of cash flows due to the passage of time are
recognized within the allowance for credit losses.
We currently do not require an estimate of expected
credit losses to be measured and recorded for U.S.
Treasury securities, agency debt securities, and other
debt securities that meet certain conditions that are
based on a combination of factors such as guarantees,
credit ratings and other credit quality factors. These
assets are monitored within our established
governance structure on a recurring basis to
determine if any changes are warranted.
Allowance for credit losses – Other financial
instruments
We also estimate expected credit losses associated
with margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements,
security lending indemnifications, and deposits with
third-party financial institutions using a similar risk
rating-based modeling approach as described in the
first allowance element within “Allowance for credit
losses – Loans and lending-related commitments”
above. The allowance for credit losses on reverse
repurchase agreements is recorded in federal funds
sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements; the allowance for credit losses on
securities lending indemnifications is recorded in
other liabilities and the allowance for credit losses on
deposits with third-party financial institutions is
recorded in cash and due from banks or interestbearing deposits with banks. Our reverse repurchase
agreements are short term and subject to continuous
over-collateralization by our counterparties and
timely collateral replenishment, when necessary. As
a result, we estimate the expected credit loss related
to the uncollateralized portion of the asset at the
balance sheet date, if any, and when there is a
reasonable expectation that the counterparty will not
replenish the collateral in compliance with the terms
of the repurchase agreement. This method is also
applied to margin lending arrangements and securities
lending indemnifications.
Allowance for credit losses – Other
We do not apply our credit loss measurement
methodologies to accrued interest receivable balances
related to our loan, debt securities and deposits with
third-party financial institution assets given our
nonaccrual policy that requires charge-off of interest
receivable when deemed uncollectible. Accrued
interest receivable related to these instruments, along
with other interest-bearing instruments, is included on
the consolidated balance sheet. Accrued interest
receivable related to each major loan class is
disclosed in our credit quality disclosure in Note 5.
Our policy for credit losses related to purchased
financial assets requires an evaluation to be
performed prior to the effective purchase date to
determine if more than an insignificant decline in
credit quality has occurred during the period between
the origination and purchase date, or, in the case of
debt securities, the period between the issuance and
purchase date. If we purchase a financial asset with
more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality,
the measurement of expected credit loss is performed
using the methodologies described above, and the
credit loss is recorded as an allowance for credit
losses on the purchase date. Subsequent to purchase,
changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected cash
flows are recognized immediately in net income by
adjusting the allowance. We evaluate various factors
in the determination of whether a more than an
insignificant decline in credit quality has occurred
and these factors vary depending upon the type of
asset purchased. Such factors include changes in risk
rating and/or agency rating, collateral deterioration,
payment status, purchase price, credit spreads and
other factors. We did not purchase any such assets in
2024 or 2023 and did not own such assets as of Dec.
31, 2024 or Dec. 31, 2023.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 141
We apply a separate credit loss methodology to
accounts receivables to estimate the expected credit
losses associated with these short-term receivables
which historically have not resulted in significant
credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on
accounts receivables is reflected in other assets.
The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors that include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We may also make adjustments for idiosyncratic
risks. Once determined in the aggregate, our
qualitative allowance is then allocated to each of our
financial instrument portfolios except for debt
securities and those instruments carried in other assets
based on the respective instruments’ quantitative
allowance balances. The allocation of this additional
allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental,
and the entire allowance for credit losses is available
to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the
loss.
The credit quality of our financial assets is assessed
on an ongoing basis. Write-offs of financial assets,
which may be full or partial, are deducted from the
allowance for credit losses and are recorded in the
period in which the financial asset(s) are deemed
uncollectible.
Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of
the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements,
over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased
facility or the estimated economic life of the
improvement. For owned and capitalized assets,
estimated useful lives range from two to 40 years.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred, while major improvements are capitalized
and amortized to operating expense over their
identified useful lives.
Leasing
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at
inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and
lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease
payments. The ROU assets and lease liabilities are
recognized based on the present value of the future
minimum lease payments over the lease term at
commencement date or at lease modification date for
certain lease modifications. For all leases, we use a
discount rate that represents a collateralized
borrowing rate based on similar terms and
information available at lease commencement date or
at the modification date for certain lease
modifications in determining the present value of
lease payments. In addition to the lease payments,
the determination of an ROU asset may also include
certain adjustments related to lease incentives and
initial direct costs incurred. Options to extend or
terminate a lease are included in the determination of
the ROU asset and lease liability only when it is
reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, while the lease
expense for finance leases is recognized using the
effective interest method. ROU assets are reviewed
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For
operating leases, if deemed impaired, the ROU asset
is written down and the remaining balance is
subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis which
results in lease expense recognition that is similar to
finance leases.
For all leases, we have elected to account for the
contractual lease and non-lease components as a
single lease component and include them in the
calculation of the lease liability. The non-lease
variable components, such as maintenance expense
and other variable costs, including non-index or rate
escalations, have been excluded from the calculation
and disclosed separately. Additionally, for certain
equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to
account for the operating lease ROU assets and
liabilities.
For subleasing activities, the rental income is reported
as part of net occupancy expense, as this activity is
not a significant business activity and is part of the
Company’s customary business practice.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
142 BNY
For direct finance leases, unearned revenue is
accreted over the lives of the leases in decreasing
amounts to provide a constant rate of return on the net
investment in the leases. We have leveraged lease
transactions that were entered into prior to Dec. 31,
2018. These leases are grandfathered under ASC
842, Leases, which became effective Jan. 1, 2019,
and will continue to be accounted for under the prior
guidance unless the leases are subsequently modified.
Revenue on leveraged leases is recognized on a basis
to achieve a constant yield on the outstanding
investment in the lease, net of the related deferred tax
liability, in the years in which the net investment is
positive. Gains and losses on residual values of
leased equipment sold are included in investment and
other revenue. Impairment of leveraged lease
residual values that is deemed other-than-temporary
is reflected in net interest income. Considering the
nature of these leases and the number of significant
assumptions, there is risk associated with the income
recognition on these leases should any of the
assumptions change materially in future periods.
Software
We capitalize costs relating to acquired software and
internal-use software development projects that
provide new or significantly improved functionality.
We capitalize projects that are expected to result in
longer-term operational benefits, such as replacement
systems or new applications that result in
significantly increased operational efficiencies or
functionality. All other costs incurred in connection
with an internal-use software project are expensed as
incurred. Capitalized software is recorded in other
assets on the balance sheet. We record amortization
of capitalized software in software and equipment
expense on the income statement.
Identified intangible assets and goodwill
Identified intangible assets with estimable lives are
amortized in a pattern consistent with the assets’
identifiable cash flows or using a straight-line method
over their remaining estimated benefit periods if the
pattern of cash flows is not estimable. Intangible
assets with estimable lives are reviewed for possible
impairment when events or changed circumstances
may affect the underlying basis of the asset.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not
amortized, but are assessed annually for impairment,
or more often if events and circumstances indicate it
is more likely than not they may be impaired and to
determine if the lives are no longer indefinite and
should be amortized. The amount of goodwill
impairment, if any, is determined by the excess of the
carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
The accounting policy for valuing and impairment
testing of identified intangible assets and goodwill
has been identified as a “critical accounting estimate”
as it requires us to make numerous complex and
subjective estimates.
Tax credit investments
Investments in renewable energy projects and
investments in qualified affordable housing projects
through a limited liability entity are accounted for
utilizing the proportional amortization method.
Under the proportional amortization method, the
initial cost of the investment is amortized to the
provision for income taxes in proportion to the tax
credits and other tax benefits received. The net
investment performance, including tax credits and
other benefits received, is recognized in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes. Additionally, the value of the commitments to
fund renewable energy projects and qualified
affordable housing projects is included in other assets
on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded for the
unfunded portion.
Seed capital
Seed capital investments are generally classified as
other assets and carried at fair value unless we are
required to consolidate the investee due to having a
controlling financial interest. Unrealized gains and
losses on seed capital investments are recorded in
investment and other revenue.
Noncontrolling interests
Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of
consolidated entities that are owned by parties other
than BNY. Noncontrolling interests included in
permanent equity are adjusted for the income or loss
attributable to the noncontrolling interest holders and
any distributions to those shareholders. Redeemable
noncontrolling interests are reported as temporary
equity and represent the redemption value resulting
from equity-classified share-based payment
arrangements that are currently redeemable or are
expected to become redeemable. We recognize
changes in the redemption value of the redeemable
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 143
noncontrolling interests as they occur and adjust the
carrying value to be equal to the redemption value.
Fee revenue
Investment services fee revenue and investment
management and performance fee revenue are based
on terms specified in a contract with a customer and
are shown net of fee waivers and exclude any
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue
is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is
satisfied by transferring control of a good or service
to a customer. A performance obligation may be
satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue
from a performance obligation satisfied over time is
recognized by measuring our progress in satisfying
the performance obligation in a manner that reflects
the transfer of goods and services to the customer.
Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a
point in time is recognized at the point in time the
customer obtains control of the promised good or
service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in
exchange for the promised goods and services. Taxes
assessed by a governmental authority, that are both
imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenueproducing transaction, are collected from a customer
and are excluded from revenue.
Performance fees are recognized in the period in
which the performance fees are earned and become
determinable. Performance fees are constrained until
all uncertainties are resolved and reversal of
previously recorded amounts is not probable.
Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of the applicable portfolio’s performance
in excess of a benchmark index or a peer group’s
performance. When a portfolio underperforms its
benchmark or fails to generate positive performance,
subsequent years’ performance must generally exceed
this shortfall prior to fees being earned. Amounts
billable, which are subject to a clawback if future
performance thresholds in current or future years are
not met, are not recognized since the fees are
potentially uncollectible. These fees are recognized
when it is determined that they will be collected.
When a multi-year performance contract provides
that fees earned are billed ratably over the
performance period, only the portion of the fees
earned that are non-refundable are recognized.
Additionally, we recognize revenue from nonrefundable, implementation fees under outsourcing
contracts using a straight-line method, commencing
in the period the ongoing services are performed
through the expected term of the contractual
relationship. Incremental direct set-up costs of
implementation, up to the related customer margin or
minimum fee revenue amount, are deferred and
amortized over the same period that the related
implementation fees are recognized. If a client
terminates an outsourcing contract prematurely, the
unamortized deferred incremental direct set-up costs
and the unamortized deferred implementation fees
related to that contract are recognized in the period
the contract is terminated.
We record foreign exchange revenue, financingrelated fees and other revenue when the services are
provided and earned based on contractual terms,
when amounts are determined and collectability is
reasonably assured.
Net interest income
Revenue on interest-earning assets and expense on
interest-bearing liabilities are recognized based on the
effective yield of the related financial instrument.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts are included in interest income and are
adjusted for prepayments when they occur, such that
the effective yield remains constant throughout the
contractual life of the security. Negative interest
incurred on assets or charged on liabilities is
presented as contra interest income and contra interest
expense, respectively.
Pension
The measurement date for BNY’s pension plans is
December 31. Plan assets are determined based on
fair value generally representing observable market
prices. The projected benefit obligation is determined
based on the present value of projected benefit
distributions at an assumed discount rate. The
discount rate utilized is based on the yield curves of
high-quality corporate bonds available in the
marketplace. The net periodic pension expense or
credit includes service costs (if applicable), interest
costs based on an assumed discount rate, an expected
return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived
market-related value, amortization of prior service
cost and amortization of prior years’ actuarial gains
and losses.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
144 BNY
Actuarial gains and losses include gains or losses
related to changes in the amount of the projected
benefit obligation or plan assets resulting from
demographic or investment experience different than
assumed, changes in the discount rate or other
assumptions. To the extent an actuarial gain or loss
exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the market-related value of plan assets,
the excess is generally recognized over the future
service periods of active employees. Benefit accruals
under the U.S. pension plans and the largest foreign
pension plan in the UK are frozen. Future
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses for these
frozen plans that exceed a threshold amount are
amortized over the average future life expectancy of
plan participants with a maximum of 15 years.
Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
is based on anticipated returns for each applicable
asset class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the
expected allocation for each asset class and are based
on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity and
fixed-income markets, which should track the longterm historical returns for these markets. We also
consider the growth outlook for U.S. and global
economies, as well as current and prospective interest
rates.
The market-related value utilized to determine the
expected return on plan assets is based on the fair
value of plan assets adjusted for the difference
between expected returns and actual performance of
plan assets. The difference between actual
experience and expected returns on plan assets is
included as an adjustment in the market-related value
over a five-year period.
Stock-based compensation
Compensation expense relating to share-based
payments is generally recognized in staff expense on
the income statement, on a straight-line basis, over
the applicable vesting period.
Certain stock compensation grants vest when the
employee retires. New grants with this feature are
expensed by the first date the employee is eligible to
retire. We estimate forfeitures when recording
compensation cost related to share-based payment
awards.
A portion of performance share unit awards are
granted with performance conditions and for which
the ultimate payout is subject to the discretion of the
Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
These awards are classified as equity and marked-tomarket to earnings over the vesting period due to this
discretion. A portion of performance share unit
awards contain market conditions. The grant date fair
value of this portion of the awards is recognized on a
straight-line-basis to staff expense unless the requisite
service period is not rendered.
Severance
BNY provides separation benefits to eligible U.S.-
based employees separated from their jobs for
business reasons not related to individual
performance. Basic separation benefits are generally
based on the employee’s years of continuous
benefited service. Severance expense for employees
based outside of the U.S. is determined in accordance
with local agreements and legal requirements.
Severance expense is recorded when management
commits to an action that will result in separation and
the amount of the liability can be reasonably
estimated.
Income taxes
We record current tax liabilities or assets through
charges or credits to the current tax provision for the
estimated taxes payable or refundable for the current
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
for future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. A deferred tax
valuation allowance is established if it is more likely
than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. A tax position that fails to meet
a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will
result in either reduction of current or deferred tax
assets, and/or recording of current or deferred tax
liabilities. Interest and penalties related to income
taxes are recorded as income tax expense.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value and include futures, forwards, interest rate
swaps, foreign currency swaps, options and similar
products. Derivatives in an unrealized gain position
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 145
are recognized as assets while derivatives in an
unrealized loss position are recognized as liabilities.
Derivatives are reported net by counterparty and after
consideration of cash collateral, to the extent subject
to legally enforceable netting agreements.
Derivatives designated and effective in qualifying
hedging relationships are classified in other assets or
other liabilities on the balance sheet. All other
derivatives are classified within trading assets or
trading liabilities on the balance sheet. Gains and
losses on trading derivatives are generally included in
foreign exchange revenue or investment and other
revenue, as applicable.
We enter into various derivative financial instruments
for non-trading purposes primarily as part of our
asset/liability management process. These nontrading derivatives are designated as one of three
types of hedge activities: fair value, cash flow or net
investment hedges.
To qualify for hedge accounting, each hedge
relationship is required to be highly effective at
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being
hedged, both prospectively and retrospectively. We
formally document all relationships, including
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our
risk management objectives and strategy for
undertaking each hedging transaction. At inception,
the potential cause of ineffectiveness related to each
of our hedges is assessed to determine if we can
expect the hedge to be highly effective over the life of
the hedging relationship. At hedge inception, we
document the methodology to be utilized for
evaluating effectiveness on an ongoing basis, and we
monitor ongoing hedge effectiveness at least
quarterly.
For qualifying fair value hedges, changes in the fair
value of the derivative, and changes in the value of
the hedged item associated with the designated risks
being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain
amounts excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in
earnings through an amortization approach over the
life of the derivative. We discontinue hedge
accounting prospectively when we determine that the
hedge is no longer effective or the derivative expires,
is sold, or management discontinues the derivative’s
hedge designation. Subsequent gains and losses on
these derivatives are included in foreign exchange
revenue or other trading revenue, as applicable. For
discontinued fair value hedges, the accumulated gain
or loss on the hedged item is amortized on a yield
basis over the remaining life of the hedged item.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair
value of the derivative are recorded in OCI, until
reclassified into earnings in the same period the
hedged item impacts earnings. If the hedge
relationship is terminated, then the change in value
will be reclassified from OCI to earnings when the
cash flows that were previously hedged affect
earnings. If cash flow hedge accounting is
discontinued as a result of a forecasted transaction no
longer being probable to occur, then the amount
reported in OCI is immediately reclassified to current
earnings.
Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized
in the same income statement line as the hedged item
affects earnings, principally interest income, interest
expense, foreign exchange revenue and staff expense.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related
to qualifying hedges of net investments in a foreign
operation are recorded with cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustments within OCI net of
their tax effect. We evaluate the effectiveness of
foreign currency derivatives designated as hedges of
net investments utilizing the forward rate method.
Earnings per common share
Basic earnings per common share is calculated by
dividing net income allocated to common
shareholders of BNY by the weighted average
common shares outstanding and vested stock-based
compensation awards where recipients have satisfied
either the explicit vesting terms or retirementeligibility requirements.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed
under the treasury stock method by dividing net
income allocated to common shareholders of BNY by
the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period plus the shares representing
the dilutive effect of equity-based awards.
Prior to 2024, we had stock-based awards that were
considered participating securities. As a result,
earnings per common share was calculated using the
two-class method under which earnings are allocated
to common shareholders and holders of participating
securities. Unvested stock-based compensation
awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
146 BNY
dividends or dividend equivalents are considered
participating securities under the two-class method.
Under the two-class method, we increased the
average number of shares of common stock
outstanding by the assumed number of shares of
common stock that would be issued assuming the
exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares
related to stock-based compensation awards using the
treasury stock method, if dilutive. Diluted earnings
per share was calculated by dividing net income
allocated to common shareholders of BNY by the
adjusted average number of common shares
outstanding.
Statement of cash flows
We have defined cash as cash and due from banks.
Distributions received from equity method investees
are classified as cash inflows from operating activities
on the statement of cash flows. Excess returns on
investments of equity method investments are
classified as cash flows from investing activities on
the statement of cash flows.
Note 2–Accounting changes and new
accounting guidance
The following accounting guidance was adopted in
2024.
ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in
Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional
Amortization Method
In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323):
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
Using the Proportional Amortization Method, which
permits reporting entities to elect to account for their
tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit
program from which the income tax credits are
received, using the proportional amortization method
if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional
amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial
cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax
credits and other income tax benefits received, and
recognizes the net amortization and income tax
credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.
We adopted this guidance on Jan. 1, 2024. The
impact of adopting this new guidance for our
renewable energy investments that met the eligibility
criteria was an increase in investment and other
revenue and an increase in the provision for income
taxes on the consolidated income statement.
Renewable energy investments are recorded in other
assets on the balance sheet. In 2024, we restated the
prior period financial statements to reflect the impact
of the retrospective application of the new accounting
guidance. The required disclosures are included in
Note 8.
The table below presents the impact of the new accounting guidance on our previously reported income statement
amounts.

ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to
Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a
public entity to disclose, on an annual and interim
basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly
provided to the chief operating decision maker
(“CODM”) and included within each reported
measure of segment profit or loss (collectively
referred to as the “significant expense principle”). In
addition, disclosure will be required of the title and
position of CODM, and how the CODM uses the
reported measure of segment profit or loss in
assessing segment performance and deciding how to
allocate resources.
We adopted this guidance as of Dec. 31, 2024. The
impact of adopting this ASU did not have a material
effect on BNY’s business segment disclosures. The
required disclosures are included in Note 24.
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122
In January 2025, the SEC staff released Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 122 (“SAB 122”), which
rescinds the interpretative guidance included in SAB
121 which had expressed the staff’s views regarding
the accounting for entities that have obligations to
safeguard “crypto-assets” held for their platform
users. SAB 121 provided that these entities should
present a liability and corresponding asset in respect
of the crypto-assets safeguarded for their platform
users. We have elected to early adopt SAB 122 on a
retrospective basis as of and for the year-ended Dec.
31, 2024. Adopting SAB 122 had no impact to our
balance sheet. We will continue to determine
whether to recognize a liability related to the risk of
loss related to our obligation to safeguard client assets
based on incurring a loss contingency that is both
probable and reasonably estimable.
Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions
We sometimes structure our acquisitions and
divestitures with both an initial payment or receipt
and later contingent payments or receipts tied to postclosing revenue or income growth.
At Dec. 31, 2024, we are potentially obligated to pay
additional consideration which is recorded at fair
value totaling approximately $5 million and, using
reasonable assumptions and estimates, could range
from $0 million to $5 million over the next year.
During 2024, we made contingent payments that
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
148 BNY
totaled $14 million. We recorded a decrease of $3
million to contingent earnout payables reflected in
other expense in 2024.
At Dec. 31, 2024, we could potentially receive
additional consideration which is recorded at fair
value totaling approximately $15 million and, using
reasonable assumptions and estimates, could range
from $5 million to $25 million over the next three
years. During 2024, contingent receipts totaled $18
million.
Transactions in 2024
On Nov. 1, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding
ownership interests in Archer Holdco, LLC, a leading
technology-enabled service provider of managed
account solutions to the asset and wealth management
industry, for cash. Non-tax deductible goodwill,
software and a customer contract intangible asset
were recorded related to this acquisition, and are
included in the Securities Services business segment.
Transactions in 2022
On Nov. 1, 2022, BNY completed the sale of BNY
Alcentra Group Holdings, Inc. (together with its
subsidiaries, “Alcentra”) for $350 million cash
consideration at close and contingent consideration
dependent on the achievement of certain performance
thresholds. We recorded an $11 million pre-tax loss
and a $40 million after-tax loss on this transaction.
At Oct. 31, 2022, Alcentra had $32 billion in assets
under management (“AUM”) concentrated in senior
secured loans, high yield bonds, private credit,
structured credit, special situations and multi-strategy
credit strategies. In addition, goodwill related to
Alcentra of $434 million was removed from the
consolidated balance sheet as a result of this sale.
On Aug. 1, 2022, BNY completed the sale of
HedgeMark Advisors, LLC (“HedgeMark”), and
recorded a $37 million pre-tax gain. As part of the
sale, BNY received an equity interest in the acquiring
firm. In addition, goodwill related to HedgeMark of
$13 million was removed from the consolidated
balance sheet as result of this sale.

In 2024, U.S. Treasury securities and CLOs with an
aggregate amortized cost of $4.0 billion and fair value
of $3.7 billion were transferred from available-forsale securities to held-to-maturity securities. This
transfer reduced the impact of changes in interest
rates on accumulated OCI.
Allowance for credit losses – Securities
The allowance for credit losses related to securities
was less than $1 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and related
to other debt securities. The allowance for credit
losses related to securities was $1 million at Dec. 31,
2023, and related to non-agency RMBS and other
debt securities.
Credit quality indicators – Securities
At Dec. 31, 2024, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase,
and for certain securities that were transferred from
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in
interest rates through the date they were transferred.
As the transfers created a new cost basis for the
securities, if these securities have experienced
unrealized losses since the date of transfer, the
corresponding unrealized losses would be reflected in
the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables.

Pledged assets
At Dec. 31, 2024, BNY had pledged assets of $138
billion, including $88 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $10 billion pledged as collateral for
borrowing at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The
components of the assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2024
included $117 billion of securities, $15 billion of
loans, $5 billion of trading assets and $1 billion of
interest-bearing deposits with banks.
If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally
allows banks to freely move assets in and out of their
pledged assets account to sell or repledge the assets
for other purposes. BNY regularly moves assets in
and out of its pledged assets account at the Federal
Reserve.
At Dec. 31, 2023, BNY had pledged assets of $134
billion, including $93 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $9 billion pledged as collateral for
borrowing at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The
components of the assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2023
included $116 billion of securities, $13 billion of
loans, $4 billion of trading assets and $1 billion of
interest-bearing deposits with banks.
At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, pledged assets
included $23 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or
repledge the assets delivered.
We also obtain securities as collateral, including
receipts under resale agreements, securities borrowed,
derivative contracts and custody agreements, on terms
which permit us to sell or repledge the securities to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

others. At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the
market value of the securities received that can be
sold or repledged was $300 billion and $212 billion,
respectively. We routinely sell or repledge these
securities through delivery to third parties. As of
Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of
securities collateral sold or repledged was $264
billion and $180 billion, respectively.
Restricted cash and securities
Cash and securities may be segregated under federal
and other regulations or requirements. At Dec. 31,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, cash segregated under
federal and other regulations or requirements was $1
billion and $3 billion, respectively. Restricted cash is
primarily included in interest-bearing deposits with
banks on the consolidated balance sheet. Securities
segregated under federal and other regulations or
requirements were $5 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $3
billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Restricted securities were
sourced from securities purchased under resale
agreements and securities borrowings and are
included in federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements on the
consolidated balance sheet.

Loan modifications
Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty results in principal
forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-thaninsignificant payment delay, or a term extension. The
modification could result in a new loan or a
continuation of the existing loan.
In 2024, we modified five commercial real estate
loans, with an aggregate recorded investment of
$212 million and unfunded lending commitments of
$20 million, by extending the maturity dates, and, in
certain instances, changing the interest rate or
providing other payment modifications. Commercial
real estate loans of $118 million were repaid prior to
Dec. 31, 2024, and unfunded lending commitments of
$16 million were canceled prior to Dec. 31, 2024.
Also in 2024, we also modified four other residential
mortgage loans, with an aggregate recorded
investment of $1 million, by providing payment
modifications.
At Dec. 31, 2024, other residential mortgage loans
that were modified in the previous 12 months and that
are now past due by more than 90 days totaled $1
million.
In 2023, we modified two commercial real estate
loans, with an aggregate recorded investment of
$71 million and an unfunded lending commitment of
$15 million, by extending the maturity dates. One of
these loans matured in 2023 after the modification.
Also in 2023, we modified six other residential
mortgage loans, with an aggregate recorded
investment of $2 million, by providing payment
modifications, extending maturity dates, reducing the
interest rate, or a combination of these modifications.

Credit quality indicators
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if
possible, based upon a number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time.

(b) The gross write-offs related to other residential mortgage loans were $3 million in 2023.
Commercial loans
The commercial loan portfolio is divided into
investment grade and non-investment grade
categories based on the assigned internal credit
ratings, which are generally consistent with those of
the public rating agencies. Customers with ratings
consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3 (Moody’s) or
better are considered to be investment grade. Those
clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.
Commercial real estate
Our income-producing commercial real estate
facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation
facilities.
Financial institutions
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with
96% of the exposures meeting the investment grade
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Dec. 31, 2024. In addition, 67% of
the financial institutions exposure is secured. For
example, securities industry clients and asset
managers often borrow against marketable securities
held in custody. The exposure to financial
institutions is generally short-term, with 84% expiring
within one year.
Wealth management loans
Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody
accounts. Eligible assets pledged for these loans are
typically investment grade fixed-income securities,
equities and/or mutual funds. Internal ratings for this
portion of the wealth management loan portfolio,
therefore, would equate to investment grade external
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
158 BNY
ratings. Wealth management loans are provided to
select customers based on the pledge of other types of
assets. For the loans collateralized by other assets,
the credit quality of the obligor is carefully analyzed,
but we do not consider this portion of wealth
management loan portfolio to be investment grade.
Wealth management mortgages
Credit quality indicators for wealth management
mortgages are not correlated to external ratings.
Wealth management mortgages are typically loans to
high-net-worth individuals, which are secured
primarily by residential property. These loans are
primarily interest-only, adjustable rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61% at
origination. Delinquency rate is a key indicator of
credit quality in the wealth management portfolio. At
Dec. 31, 2024, less than 1% of the mortgages were
past due.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other –
46%.
Lease financings
At Dec. 31, 2024, all of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified
assets. The largest components of our lease residual
value exposure related to real estate and large-ticket
transportation equipment. Assets are both foreign
and domestic-based, with primary concentrations in
Germany and the U.S.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and
totaled $1.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. These loans are not typically
correlated to external ratings.
Capital call financing
Capital call financing includes loans to private equity
funds that are secured by the fund investors’ capital
commitments and the funds’ right to call capital.
Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that
are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds
and fixed-income securities.
Margin loans
We had $19.1 billion of secured margin loans at Dec.
31, 2024, compared with $18.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Margin loans are collateralized with
marketable securities, and borrowers are required to
maintain a daily collateral margin in excess of 100%
of the value of the loan. We have rarely suffered a
loss on these types of loans.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $3.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2024 and $3.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Overdrafts
occur on a daily basis and are generally repaid within
two business days.
Reverse repurchase agreements
Reverse repurchase agreements at Dec. 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023 were fully secured with high-quality
collateral. As a result, there was no allowance for
credit losses related to these assets at Dec. 31, 2024
and Dec. 31, 2023.

Goodwill impairment testing
The goodwill impairment test is performed at least
annually at the reporting unit level. BNY’s business
segments include seven reporting units for which
goodwill impairment testing is performed. An
interim goodwill impairment test is performed when
events or circumstances occur that may indicate that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of any
reporting unit may be less than its carrying value.
In each quarter of 2024, we completed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment
Management reporting unit, which had $6.0 billion of
allocated goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2024. In all cases,
we determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value and no goodwill impairment was recorded.
For the Dec. 31, 2024 test, the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 11%. We
determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit using an income approach
based on management’s projections as of Dec. 31,
2024. The discount rate applied to these cash flows
was 10.5%.
The cash flow estimates for the Investment
Management reporting unit are impacted by
projections of the level and mix of assets under
management, market values, operating margins and
long-term growth rates.
In the second quarter of 2024, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining six
reporting units using an income approach to estimate
the fair values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 161
flows used in the income approach were based on
management’s projections as of April 1, 2024. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%.
As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no
goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair values
of the Company’s remaining six reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting
units’ carrying value.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is
subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of
cash flows that extend far into the future, and, by
their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an
extended time frame. In the future, changes in the
assumptions or the discount rate could produce a
material non-cash goodwill impairment.
In the third quarter 2022, based on results of an
interim goodwill impairment test we recorded an
impairment charge of $680 million. This goodwill
impairment represents a non-cash charge and did not
affect BNY’s liquidity position, tangible common
equity or regulatory capital ratios.

Non-readily marketable equity securities
Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments
are valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment,
and plus or minus changes resulting from observable
price changes in orderly transactions for an identical
or similar investment of the same issuer. The
observable price changes are recorded in investment
and other revenue on the consolidated income
statement. Our non-readily marketable equity
securities totaled $413 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and
$479 million at Dec. 31, 2023, and are included in
other equity investments in the table above.

Tax credit investments
Tax credit investments include affordable housing
projects and renewable energy investments. We
invest in affordable housing projects primarily to
satisfy the Company’s requirements under the
Community Reinvestment Act. We invest in
renewable energy projects to receive an expected
after-tax return, which consists of allocated renewable
energy tax credits, tax deductions and cash
distributions based on the operations of the project.
On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02,

In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity
investments, primarily small business investment
companies (“SBICs”), which are compliant with the
Volcker Rule, and certain other corporate
investments. Seed capital, private equity and other
corporate investments are included in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of
certain of these investments was estimated using the
NAV per share for our ownership interest in the
funds.

$251 million in 2029. No time deposits are scheduled
to mature after 2029.
Note 10–Contract revenue
Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and
Wealth Management business segments is primarily
variable, based on levels of assets under custody and/
or administration (“AUC/A”), AUM and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in fee
schedules.
Investment services fees are based primarily on the
market value of AUC/A; client accounts, balances
and the volume of transactions; securities lending
volume and spreads; and fees for other services.
Certain fees based on the market value of assets are
calculated in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Investment services fees also include transactionbased fees, which are driven by customer actions and
are delivered at a point-in-time. These transactionbased fees are generally recognized on trade date.
Other contractual investment services fees are driven
by the amount of AUC/A or the number of accounts
or securities positions and are billed on a monthly or
quarterly basis.
Substantially all services within the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments are provided over time. Revenue on these
services is recognized using the time elapsed method,
equal to the expected invoice amount, which typically
represents the value provided to the customer for our
performance completed to date.
Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM. The management
fees, expressed in basis points, are charged for
managing those assets. Management fees are
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
164 BNY
typically subject to fee schedules contained in an
investment management agreement or fund
documents based on the overall level of assets
managed and products in which those assets are
invested.
Investment management fee revenue also includes
transactional- and account-based fees. These fees,
along with distribution and servicing fees, are
recognized when the services have been completed.
Clients are generally billed for services performed on
a monthly or quarterly basis.
Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of the applicable portfolio’s performance
in excess of a benchmark index or a peer group’s
performance. Performance fees are recognized at the
end of the measurement period when they are
determinable.
See Note 24 for additional information on our
principal business segments, Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and
Wealth Management, and the primary services
provided.

Contract balances
Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables
from customers were $2.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2024
and $2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have
not yet been billed to the customers due to certain
contractual terms other than the passage of time and
were $34 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $27 million at
Dec. 31, 2023. Accrued revenues recorded as
contract assets are usually billed on an annual basis.
Both receivables from customers and contract assets
are included in other assets on the consolidated
balance sheet.
Contract liabilities represent payments received in
advance of providing services under certain contracts
and were $171 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $172
million at Dec. 31, 2023. Contract liabilities are
included in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet. Revenue recognized in 2024 relating
to contract liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2023 was $116
million.
Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily
relate to either party’s performance under the
contracts.
Contract costs
Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are
deemed recoverable are capitalized as contract costs.
Such costs result from the payment of sales
incentives, primarily in the Wealth Management
business, and totaled $44 million at Dec. 31, 2024
and $46 million at Dec. 31, 2023. Capitalized sales
incentives are amortized based on the transfer of
goods or services to which the assets relate. The
amortization of capitalized sales incentives, which is
primarily included in staff expense on the
consolidated income statement, totaled $14 million in
2024, $16 million in 2023 and $19 million in 2022.
Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they
relate directly to an existing contract or a specific
anticipated contract, generate or enhance resources
that will be used to fulfill performance obligations,
and are recoverable. Such costs generally represent
set-up costs, which include any direct cost incurred at
the inception of a contract which enables the
fulfillment of the performance obligation, and totaled
$98 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $90 million at Dec.
31, 2023. These capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected contract period.
Unsatisfied performance obligations
We do not have any unsatisfied performance
obligations other than those that are subject to a
practical expedient election under ASC 606, Revenue
From Contracts With Customers. The practical
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
166 BNY
expedient election applies to (i) contracts with an
original expected length of one year or less, and (ii)
contracts for which we recognize revenue at the
amount to which we have the right to invoice for
services performed.

As of Dec. 31, 2024, BNY had $101 million of U.S.
foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to
expire in 2029. In addition, we have an unrealized
capital loss of $34 million. We believe it is more
likely than not that the benefit from these items will
not be realized. Accordingly, we have recorded a
valuation allowance of $135 million. We believe it is
more likely than not that we will fully realize our
remaining deferred tax assets. This conclusion is
based on historical financial results and profit
forecasts.
As of Dec. 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.4
billion of earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries
that have been permanently reinvested abroad and for
which no local distribution tax provision has been
recorded. If these earnings were to be repatriated, the
estimated tax liability as of Dec. 31, 2024 would be
up to $170 million.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if
applicable, related to income taxes in income tax
expense. Included in the balance sheet at Dec. 31,
2024 is accrued interest, where applicable, of $41

Note 14–Variable interest entities
We have variable interests in VIEs, which include
investments in retail, institutional and alternative
investment funds.
We earn management fees from these funds, as well
as performance fees in certain funds, and may also
provide start-up capital for new funds. The funds are
primarily financed by our customers’ investments in
the funds’ equity or debt.
Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable
housing and renewable energy projects, which are
designed to generate a return primarily through the
realization of tax credits. The projects, which are
structured as limited partnerships and limited liability
companies, are also VIEs, but are not consolidated.
The following table presents the incremental assets
and liabilities included on the consolidated balance
sheet as of Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. The net
assets of any consolidated VIE are solely available to
settle the liabilities of the VIE and to settle any
investors’ ownership liquidation requests, including
any seed capital we invested in the VIE.

provided to our VIEs. Additionally, creditors of any
consolidated VIEs do not have any recourse to the
general credit of BNY.

Common stock
BNY has 3.5 billion authorized shares of common
stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. At Dec. 31,
2024, 717,680,268 shares of common stock were
outstanding.
In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common
stock, from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. We began
paying the increased quarterly cash dividend in the
third quarter of 2024.
Common stock repurchase program
In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This share
repurchase plan replaced all previously authorized
share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity
under the existing January 2023 authorization.
In 2024, we repurchased 48.9 million common shares
at an average price of $62.70 per common share for a
total of $3.1 billion.
Share repurchases may be executed through open
market repurchases, in privately negotiated
transactions or by other means, including through
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share
repurchase and other structured transactions. The
timing and exact amount of any common stock
repurchases will depend on various factors, including
market conditions and the common stock trading
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.
Preferred stock
The Parent has 100 million authorized shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. The following

BNY’s ability to declare or pay dividends on, or
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our
common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to
the preferred stock as to the payment of dividends
and/or the distribution of any assets on any
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Parent
will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in
the event that we do not declare and pay in full
preferred dividends for the then-current dividend

All of the outstanding shares of the Series A preferred
stock are owned by Mellon Capital IV, a 100%
owned financing subsidiary of the Parent, which will
pass through any dividend on the Series A preferred
stock to the holders of its Normal Preferred Capital
Securities. The Parent’s obligations under the trust
and other agreements relating to Mellon Capital IV
have the effect of providing a full and unconditional
guarantee, on a subordinated basis, of payments due
on the Normal Preferred Capital Securities. No other
subsidiary of the Parent guarantees the securities of
Mellon Capital IV. All of the outstanding shares of
the Series F, Series G, Series H and Series I preferred
stock are held by the depositary of the depositary
shares, which will pass through the applicable portion
of any dividend on the Series F, Series G, Series H
and Series I preferred stock to the holders of record of
their respective depositary shares.
In December 2023, the Parent redeemed all
outstanding shares of its Series D preferred stock,

Temporary equity
Temporary equity was $87 million at Dec. 31, 2024
and $85 million at Dec. 31, 2023. Temporary equity
represents the redemption value recorded for
redeemable noncontrolling interests resulting from
equity-classified share-based payment arrangements
that are currently redeemable or are expected to
become redeemable.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the
Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding
company, our U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY must,
among other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As
of Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, BNY and our
U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.”
The regulatory capital ratios of our consolidated and
largest bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York
Mellon, are shown below.
Consolidated and largest bank
subsidiary regulatory capital ratios (a) Dec. 31,
2024 2023
Consolidated regulatory capital ratios:
Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio 11.2% 11.5%
Tier 1 capital ratio 13.7 14.2
Total capital ratio 14.8 14.9

The Bank of New York Mellon
regulatory capital ratios:
CET1 ratio 16.1% 16.2%
Tier 1 capital ratio 16.1 16.2
Total capital ratio 16.3 16.3
Tier 1 leverage ratio 6.3 6.6
SLR (b) 7.6 8.5
(a) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our
effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower
of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and
Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based
on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets. For
BNY to qualify as “well capitalized,” its Tier 1 capital and
Total capital ratios must be at least 6% and 10%,
respectively. For The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest
bank subsidiary, to qualify as “well capitalized,” its CET1,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios must
be at least 6.5%, 8%, 10% and 5%, respectively.
(b) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage
exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet
exposures. For The Bank of New York Mellon to qualify as
“well capitalized,” its SLR must be at least 6%.
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules
more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition.
If a BHC such as BNY, or a bank such as The Bank
of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., fails to
satisfy minimum capital requirements or qualify as
“adequately capitalized,” regulatory sanctions and
limitations will be imposed.

Note 17–Stock-based compensation
Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the
issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) and other stock-based awards, including
options, to employees and directors of BNY. At Dec.
31, 2024, under the Long-Term Incentive Plan
approved in April 2023, we may issue 37,099,283
new stock-based awards, all of which may be issued
as restricted stock or RSUs. Stock-based
compensation expense related to retirement eligibility
vesting totaled $77 million in 2024, $81 million in
2023 and $72 million in 2022.
RSUs and Performance share units
RSUs are granted under our long-term incentive plans
at no cost to the recipient. These awards are subject
to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed,
including continued employment, for a specified
period. An RSU entitles the recipient to receive a
share of common stock after the applicable
restrictions lapse. The recipient generally is entitled
to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends
paid on the underlying common stock during the
period the RSU is outstanding but does not receive
voting rights. The cash dividends are paid at the time
of vesting.
The fair value of RSUs is equal to the fair market
value of our common stock on the date of grant. The
expense is recognized over the vesting period, which
is generally zero to four years. The total
compensation expense recognized for RSUs was
$386 million in 2024, $332 million in 2023 and $293
million in 2022. The total income tax benefit
recognized in the consolidated income statement
related to compensation costs was $92 million in
2024, $79 million in 2023 and $69 million in 2022.
BNY’s Executive Committee members were granted
a target award of 851,939 performance share units
(“PSUs”) in 2024, 577,549 in 2023 and 513,101 in
2022. The Executive Committee PSUs will vest
based on two separate and distinct measurements, a
performance condition and a market condition split
70% based on return on tangible common
shareholders’ equity (“ROTCE”) and 30% on Total
Shareholder Return (“TSR”). The ROTCE portion
was measured based on the fair market value on the
date of the grant, while the TSR portion was valued
using a Monte Carlo simulation method. Each
condition only impacts its applicable portion
(70%/30%) of the total PSU award. The performance
and market conditions are measured after three years
to determine the final percentage of the total PSUs to
vest. The final total amount of vested PSUs will be
the sum of the two separate and distinct performance
and market-based portions of the PSU awards, but
will be capped at 150% of the total PSUs awarded.
The ultimate payout is subject to the discretion of the
Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
These awards are classified as equity and the ROTCE
portion is marked-to-market to earnings as a result of
this discretion. The TSR portion of the award
contains a market condition, and as a result the grant
date fair value is recognized over the service period
unless the requisite service is not rendered.
The following table summarizes our non-vested PSU
and RSU activity for 2024.

As of Dec. 31, 2024, $434 million of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested PSUs and RSUs is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.
The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested
was $347 million in 2024, $305 million in 2023 and
$264 million in 2022. The actual excess tax benefit
realized for the tax deductions from shares vested
totaled $7 million in 2024, $3 million in 2023 and
$16 million in 2022. The tax impacts were
recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Subsidiary Long-Term Incentive Plans
BNY also has several subsidiary Long-Term
Incentive Plans which have issued restricted
subsidiary shares to certain employees. These share
awards are subject to forfeiture until certain
restrictions have lapsed, including continued
employment for a specified period of time. The
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 175
shares are generally non-voting and non-dividend
paying. Once the restrictions lapse, which generally
occurs in three to five years, the shares can only be
sold, at the option of the employee, to BNY at a price
based generally on the fair value of the subsidiary at
the time of repurchase. In certain instances, BNY has
an election to call the shares.
Stock options
Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the
issuance of stock options at fair market value at the
date of grant to officers and employees of BNY. No
stock options were granted in 2024, 2023 or 2022,
and no stock options were outstanding at Dec. 31,
2024, Dec. 31, 2023 or Dec. 31, 2022.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $15
million in 2022. Cash received from option exercises
totaled $9 million in 2022. The actual excess tax
benefit realized for the tax deductions from options
exercised totaled $3 million in 2022 and was
recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Note 18–Employee benefit plans
BNY has defined benefit and/or defined contribution
retirement plans and other post-retirement plans
providing healthcare benefits.
The defined benefit pension plans cover
approximately 6,400 U.S. employees and
approximately 18,400 non-U.S. employees.
BNY has one qualified and several non-qualified
defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and several
pension plans overseas.
Effective June 30, 2015, the benefit accruals under
the U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
plans were frozen. This change resulted in no
additional benefits being earned by participants in
those plans based on service or pay after June 30,
2015. These plans were previously closed to new
participants effective Dec. 31, 2010.
Effective Dec. 31, 2018, the benefit accruals were
frozen under our largest foreign plan, which covers
certain UK employees. This change resulted in no
additional benefits being earned by participants in
that plan based on service or pay after Dec. 31, 2018.
Most UK employees currently earn benefits only on a
defined contribution basis. UK employees impacted
by the pension plan freeze began earning benefits on
a defined contribution basis on Jan. 1, 2019.

N/A – Not applicable.
A number of key assumptions and measurement date
values determine pension expense. The key elements
include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the
discount rate, the market-related value of plan assets
and the price used to value stock in the Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).
The discount rate for U.S. pension plans was
determined after reviewing equivalent rates obtained
by discounting the pension plans’ expected cash
flows using various high-quality, long-term corporate
bond yield curves. We also reviewed the results of
several models that matched bonds to our pension
cash flows. After reviewing the various indices and
models, we selected a discount rate of 5.72% as of
Dec. 31, 2024.
The discount rates for foreign pension plans are based
on high-quality corporate bond rates in countries that
have an active corporate bond market. In those
countries with no active corporate bond market,
discount rates are based on local government bond
rates plus a credit spread.
Actuarial gains on the benefit obligation for the
domestic and foreign pension plans in 2024 are
primarily attributable to increases in discount rates.
Actuarial losses on the benefit obligation for the
domestic pension plans in 2023 are primarily
attributable to decreases in discount rates. Actuarial
losses on the benefit obligation for the foreign
pension plans in 2023 are primarily attributable to
decreases in discount rates and increases in assumed
inflation rates.

Assumed healthcare cost trend
The assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in
determining domestic benefit expense for 2025 is
8.90%, decreasing to 4.50% in 2035 for pre-Medicare
costs and 9.80% decreasing to 4.50% in 2035 for
Medicare costs. The initial trend rate assumption
represents an estimate of short-term cost increases
based on recent health care marketplace experience,
and taking into consideration the cost characteristics
of plans available to retirees. Annual increases in
national health expenditures have exceeded the
general growth in GDP for many years. However,
there are practical limitations to how long these
trends can continue. It is unrealistic to assume that
health care expenditures will be allowed to consume
the majority of the economy. Therefore, over the
long term we expect that health care costs will be
constrained by the public’s ability and willingness to
pay the higher cost of health care coverage. This
assumption implies that the ultimate trend rate should
be related to the expected long-term growth in the
economy. Therefore, we assume the ultimate rate to
be comprised of real growth in per capita GDP, longterm growth attributable to technology innovations,
and the assumed long-term inflation rate. The initial
trend is assumed to decrease to this ultimate rate over
time.
The following benefit payments for the pension and
healthcare plans, which reflect expected future
service as appropriate, are expected to be paid over
the next 10 years:

We expect to make cash contributions to fund our

for the domestic plans and $6 million for the foreign
plans.
We expect to make cash contributions to fund our
post-retirement healthcare plans in 2025 of $9 million
for the domestic plans and less than $1 million for the
foreign plans.
Investment strategy and asset allocation
We are responsible for the administration of various
employee pension and healthcare post-retirement
benefits plans, both domestically and internationally.
The domestic plans are administered by BNY’s
Benefits Administration Committee, a named
fiduciary. Subject to the following, at all relevant
times, BNY’s Benefits Investment Committee,
another named fiduciary to the domestic plans, is
responsible for the investment of plan assets. The
Benefits Investment Committee’s responsibilities
include the investment of all domestic defined benefit
plan assets, as well as the determination of investment
options offered to participants in all domestic defined
contribution plans. The Benefits Investment
Committee conducts periodic reviews of investment
performance, asset allocation and investment
manager suitability. In addition, the Benefits
Investment Committee has oversight of the Regional
Governance Committees for the foreign defined
benefit plans.
Our investment objective for U.S. and foreign plans is
to maximize total return while maintaining a broadly
diversified portfolio for the primary purpose of
satisfying obligations for future benefit payments.
Our plans are primarily invested in fixed income and
equity securities. In general, for the domestic plan’s
portfolio, fixed income securities can range from 35%
to 100% of plan assets, equity securities and
alternative investments can range from 0% to 65% of
plan assets and cash equivalents can be held in
amounts ranging from 0% to 10% of plan assets.
Actual asset allocation within the approved ranges
varies from time to time based on economic
conditions (both current and forecast), the timing of
transitional reallocations and the advice of
professional advisors.

Fair value measurement of plan assets
We have established a three-level hierarchy for fair
value measurements of our pension plan assets based
upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an
asset as of the measurement date.
The following is a description of the valuation
methodologies used for assets measured at fair value,
as well as the general classification of such assets
pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Cash and currency
This category consists primarily of foreign currency
balances and is included in Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy. Foreign currency is translated monthly
based on current foreign exchange rates.
Common and preferred stock and exchange-traded
funds
These investments include equities and are valued at
the closing price reported in the active market in
which the individual securities are traded, if available.
Common and preferred stock and exchange-traded
funds are included in Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy.
Collective trust funds
Collective trust funds include commingled and U.S.
equity funds that have no readily available market
quotations. The fair value of the funds is based on
the securities in the portfolio, which typically are the
amount that the fund might reasonably expect to
receive for the securities upon a sale. These funds are
valued using observable inputs on either a daily or
monthly basis. Collective trust funds are included in
Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Fixed-income investments
Fixed-income investments include U.S. Treasury
securities, U.S. government agencies, non-U.S.
government securities, sovereign government
obligations, state and political subdivisions, U.S.
corporate bonds and foreign corporate debt funds.
U.S. Treasury and certain non-U.S. government
securities that are actively traded in highly liquid
over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets are valued at the
closing price reported in the active market in which
the individual security is traded and included as Level
1 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. government
agencies, non-U.S. government securities, sovereign
government obligations, state and political
subdivisions, U.S. corporate bonds and foreign
corporate debt funds are valued based on quoted
prices for comparable securities with similar yields
and credit ratings. When quoted prices are not
available for identical or similar bonds, the bonds are
valued using discounted cash flows that maximize
observable inputs, such as current yields of similar
instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks
that may not be observable, such as credit and
liquidity risks. U.S. government agencies, non-U.S.
government securities, sovereign government
obligations, state and political subdivisions, U.S.
corporate bonds and foreign corporate debt funds are
primarily included in Level 2 of the valuation
hierarchy.
Other assets measured at NAV per share, as a
practical expedient
Other assets measured at NAV, as a practical
expedient, include funds of funds, venture capital and
partnership interests and other funds. There are no
readily available market quotations for these funds.
The fair value of the funds of funds is based on
NAVs of the funds in the portfolio, which reflect the
value of the underlying investments held by the fund,
less its liabilities. The fair value of the underlying
investments is typically the amount that the fund
might reasonably expect to receive upon selling those
hard to value or illiquid investments within the
portfolios. These funds are either valued on a daily or
monthly basis. The fair value of the venture capital
and partnership interests is based on the pension
plan’s ownership percentage of the fair value of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
180 BNY
underlying funds as provided by the fund managers.
These funds are typically valued on a quarterly basis.

major category of plan assets as of Dec. 31, 2024 and

Defined contribution plans
We sponsor defined contribution plans in the U.S.
and in certain non-U.S. locations, all of which are
administered in accordance with local laws. The
most significant defined contribution plan is The
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 401(k)
Savings Plan sponsored by the Company in the U.S.
and covers substantially all U.S. employees.
Under The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
401(k) Savings Plan for 2024, 2023 and 2022, the
Company matched 100% of participant contributions
up to 7% of an employee’s eligible base pay with a
monetary limit of $16,000 per participant. In
addition, an annual non-elective contribution of $750
was made in 2024, 2023 and 2022 to each participant
with eligible base pay of less than $100,000 a year
and who are credited with at least one year of service.
At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, The Bank of
New York Mellon Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan
owned 7.8 million and 8.7 million shares of our
common stock, respectively. The fair value of total
assets was $10.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $8.8
billion at Dec. 31, 2023. We recorded expenses of
$264 million in 2024, $282 million in 2023 and $276
million in 2022, primarily for contributions to our
defined contribution plans.
We also have an ESOP covering certain domestic
full-time employees hired on or before July 1, 2008.
The ESOP works in conjunction with the defined
benefit pension plan. Employees are entitled to the
higher of their benefit under the ESOP or such
defined benefit pension plan at retirement. Benefits
payable under the defined benefit pension plan are
offset by the equivalent value of benefits earned
under the ESOP.
At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the ESOP
owned 3.1 million and 3.5 million shares of our
common stock, respectively. The fair value of total
ESOP assets was $244 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and
$185 million at Dec. 31, 2023. The Company is not
permitted to make contributions to the ESOP.
The Benefits Investment Committee appointed
Fiduciary Counselors Inc. to serve as the independent
fiduciary to (i) make all fiduciary decisions related to
the continued prudence of offering the common stock
of BNY or its affiliates as an investment option under
the plans, other than plan sponsor decisions, and (ii)
select and monitor any actively or passively managed
investments that are managed by BNY or its affiliates
to be offered to participants as investment options
under the plans, excluding self-directed accounts.
Note 19–Company financial information
(Parent Corporation)
In connection with our single point of entry resolution
strategy, we have established an intermediate holding
company (“IHC”) to facilitate the provision of capital
and liquidity resources to certain key subsidiaries in
the event of material financial distress or failure. In
2017, we entered into a binding support agreement
with those key subsidiaries and other related entities
that requires the IHC to provide that support. The
support agreement requires the Parent to transfer cash
and other liquid financial assets to the IHC on an
ongoing basis, subject to certain amounts retained by
the Parent to meet its near-term cash needs. The
Parent’s and the IHC’s obligations under the support
agreement are secured. The IHC has provided
unsecured subordinated funding notes to the Parent as
well as a committed line of credit that allows the
Parent to draw funds necessary to service near-term
obligations. As a result, during business-as-usual
circumstances, the Parent is expected to continue to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
182 BNY
have access to the funds necessary to pay dividends,
repurchase common stock, service its debt and satisfy
its other obligations. If our projected financial
resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the
Parent becomes imminent, the committed line of
credit the IHC provided to the Parent will
automatically terminate, with all amounts outstanding
becoming due and payable, and the support
agreement will require the Parent to transfer most of
its remaining assets (other than stock in subsidiaries
and a cash reserve to fund bankruptcy expenses) to
the IHC. As a result, during a period of severe
financial stress, the Parent could become unable to
meet its debt and payment obligations (including with
respect to its securities), causing the Parent to seek
protection under bankruptcy laws earlier than it
otherwise would have.
Our bank subsidiaries are subject to dividend
limitations under the federal and state banking laws.
Under these statutes, prior regulatory consent is
required for dividends in any year that would exceed
the bank’s net profits for such year combined with
retained net profits for the prior two years.
Additionally, such bank subsidiaries may not declare
dividends in excess of net profits on hand, as defined,
after deducting the amount by which the principal
amount of all loans, on which interest is past due for a
period of six months or more, exceeds the allowance
for credit losses.
The payment of dividends also is limited by
minimum capital requirements and buffers imposed
on banks. As of Dec. 31, 2024, our bank subsidiaries
exceeded these requirements.
Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2024, our U.S. bank
subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of
approximately $82 million, without the need for a
regulatory waiver. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2024, nonbank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.8 billion.
The bank subsidiaries declared dividends of $4.3
billion in 2024, $3.5 billion in 2023 and $1.0 billion
in 2022. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency have issued additional
guidelines that require BHCs and national banks to
continually evaluate the level of cash dividends in
relation to their respective operating income, capital
needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
The Federal Reserve policy with respect to the
payment of cash dividends by BHCs provides that, as
a matter of prudent banking, a BHC should not
maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net
income available to common shareholders has been
sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the
prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be
consistent with the holding company’s capital needs,
asset quality and overall financial condition. The
Federal Reserve can also prohibit a dividend if
payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound
banking practice.
In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity
under the existing January 2023 authorization.
The Federal Reserve Act limits, and requires
collateral for, extensions of credit by our insured
subsidiary banks to the Parent and certain of its nonbank affiliates. Also, there are restrictions on the
amounts of investments by such banks in stock and
other securities of BNY and such affiliates, and
restrictions on the acceptance of their securities as
collateral for loans by such banks. Extensions of
credit by the banks to each of our affiliates are limited
to 10% of such bank’s regulatory capital, and in the
aggregate for BNY and all such affiliates to 20%, and
collateral must be between 100% and 130% of the
amount of the credit, depending on the type of
collateral.
In the event of impairment of the capital stock of one
of the Parent’s national banks or The Bank of New
York Mellon, the Parent, as the banks’ stockholder,
could be required to pay such deficiency.
The Parent guarantees the uncommitted lines of credit
of Pershing LLC and Pershing Limited subsidiaries.
The Parent guarantees described above are full and
unconditional and contain the standard provisions
relating to parent guarantees of subsidiary debt.
Additionally, the Parent guarantees or indemnifies
obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries as needed.
Generally, there are no stated notional amounts
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 183
included in these indemnifications and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for
indemnification are not expected to occur. As a
result, we are unable to develop an estimate of the
maximum payout under these indemnifications.
However, we believe the possibility is remote that we
will have to make any material payment under these
guarantees and indemnifications.

Note 20–Fair value measurement
Fair value is defined as the price that would be
received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability,
in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for
fair value measurements is utilized based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or
liability as of the measurement date. BNY’s own
creditworthiness is considered when valuing
liabilities.
Fair value focuses on exit price in an orderly
transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or
distressed sale) between market participants at the
measurement date under current market conditions.
If there has been a significant decrease in the volume
and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change
in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation
techniques may be appropriate. In such instances,
determining the price at which willing market
participants would transact at the measurement date
under current market conditions depends on the facts
and circumstances and requires the use of significant
judgment. The objective is to determine from
weighted indicators of fair value a reasonable point
within the range that is most representative of fair
value under current market conditions.
Determination of fair value
We have established processes for determining fair
values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices
in active markets, where available. For financial
instruments where quotes from recent exchange
transactions are not available, we determine fair value
based on discounted cash flow analysis, comparison
to similar instruments and the use of financial models.
Discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon
estimated future cash flows and the level of interest
rates. Model-based pricing uses inputs of observable
prices, where available, for interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, option volatilities and other factors.
Models are benchmarked and validated by an
independent internal risk management function. Our
valuation process takes into consideration factors
such as counterparty credit quality, liquidity,
concentration concerns and observability of model
parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to
record financial instruments at fair value.
Most derivative contracts are valued using models
which are calibrated to observable market data and
employ standard market pricing theory for their
valuations. Valuation models incorporate
counterparty credit risk by discounting each trade’s
expected exposures to the counterparty using the
counterparty’s credit spreads, as implied by the credit
default swap market. We also adjust expected
liabilities to the counterparty using BNY’s own credit
spreads, as implied by the credit default swap market.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 185
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions
is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit
spreads, as well as those of our counterparties.
In certain cases, recent prices may not be observable
for instruments that trade in inactive or less active
markets. Upon evaluating the uncertainty in valuing
financial instruments subject to liquidity issues, we
make an adjustment to their value. The determination
of the liquidity adjustment includes the availability of
external quotes, the time since the latest available
quote and the price volatility of the instrument.
Certain parameters in some financial models are not
directly observable and, therefore, are based on
management’s estimates and judgments. These
financial instruments are normally traded less
actively. We apply valuation adjustments to mitigate
the possibility of error and revision in the modelbased estimate value. Examples include products
where parameters such as correlation and recovery
rates are unobservable.
The methods described above for instruments that
trade in inactive or less active markets may produce a
current fair value calculation that may not be
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
future fair values. We believe our methods of
determining fair value are appropriate and consistent
with other market participants. However, the use of
different methodologies or different assumptions to
value certain financial instruments could result in a
different estimate of fair value.
Valuation hierarchy
A three-level valuation hierarchy is used for
disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or
liability as of the measurement date. The three levels
are described below.
Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets and
liabilities include certain debt and equity securities,
derivative financial instruments actively traded on
exchanges and highly liquid government bonds.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices,
for example, quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active, and inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt instruments
that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded
securities and derivative financial instruments whose
model inputs are observable in the market or can be
corroborated by market-observable data.
Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are
unobservable and significant to the fair value
measurement.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the
valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Valuation methodology
Following is a description of the valuation
methodologies used for instruments measured at fair
value, as well as the general classification of such
instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Securities
We determine fair value primarily based on pricing
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
Where quoted prices are available in an active
market, we classify the securities within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. Securities include both long
and short positions. Level 1 securities include U.S.
Treasury and certain non-U.S. government debt
securities that are actively traded in highly liquid
OTC markets, money market funds and exchangetraded equities.
If quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are primarily determined using pricing models using
observable trade data, market data, quoted prices of
securities with similar characteristics or discounted
cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which
would generally be classified within Level 2 of the
valuation hierarchy, include RMBS, MBS, certain
non-U.S. government debt, foreign covered bonds
and CLOs.
Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g.,
vintage, position in the securitization structure) and
ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of
prepayment for the types of transaction and apply
such variables to similar types of bonds. We view
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
186 BNY
these as observable transactions in the current
marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2.
Pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific
security whenever they determine there is insufficient
observable data to provide a good-faith opinion on
price.
At Dec. 31, 2024, approximately 99% of our
securities were valued by pricing sources with
reasonable levels of price transparency. The
remaining securities were generally valued using
observable inputs. Additional disclosures of
securities are provided in Note 4.
In certain cases where there is limited activity or less
transparency around inputs to the valuation, we
classify those securities in Level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy. As of Dec. 31, 2024, we have no
instruments included in Level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy.
Derivative financial instruments
We classify exchange-traded derivative financial
instruments valued using quoted prices in Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. Examples include exchangetraded equity options and interest rate futures and
options. Since few other classes of derivative
contracts are listed on an exchange, most of our
derivative positions are valued using models that use
as their basis readily observable market parameters,
and we classify them in Level 2 of the valuation
hierarchy. Such derivative financial instruments
include swaps and options, foreign exchange spot and
forward contracts and credit default swaps.
Derivatives valued using models with significant
unobservable market parameters in markets that lack
two-way flow are classified in Level 3 of the
valuation hierarchy. Examples may include longdated swaps and options, where parameters may be
unobservable for longer maturities; and certain highly
structured products, where correlation risk is
unobservable. As of Dec. 31, 2024, we have no
Level 3 derivatives. Additional disclosures of
derivative instruments are provided in Note 23.
Seed capital
In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. Seed capital is generally included
in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
When applicable, we value seed capital based on the
published NAV of the fund.
For other types of investments in funds, we consider
all of the rights and obligations inherent in our
ownership interest, including the reported NAV as
well as other factors that affect the fair value of our
interest in the fund.
Other assets measured at NAV
We hold private equity investments, primarily SBICs,
which are compliant with the Volcker Rule. There
are no readily available market quotations for these
investment partnerships. The fair value of the SBICs
is based on our ownership percentage of the fair value
of the underlying investments as provided by the
partnership managers. These investments are
typically valued on a quarterly basis. Our SBIC
private equity investments are valued at NAV as a
practical expedient for fair value.
The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023, by caption on the consolidated balance sheet
and by the three-level valuation hierarchy. We have
included credit ratings information in certain of the
tables because the information indicates the degree of
credit risk to which we are exposed, and significant
changes in ratings classifications could result in
increased risk for us.

Note 21–Fair value option
We elected fair value as an alternative measurement
for selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value,
including the assets and liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds and subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments.
The following table presents the assets and liabilities
of consolidated investment management funds, at fair
value.
Assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds, at fair value

(in millions) 2024 2023
Assets of consolidated investment

Total assets of consolidated
investment management funds $ 891 $ 526
Liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds:
Other liabilities $ 5 $ 1
Total liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds $ 5 $ 1
The assets and liabilities of the consolidated
investment management funds are included in other
assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the
consolidated balance sheet. We value the assets and
liabilities of consolidated investment management
funds using quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets or observable inputs such
as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.
Quoted prices for either identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets may also be used.
Accordingly, fair value best reflects the interests
BNY holds in the economic performance of the
consolidated investment management funds.
Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities
are recorded as income (loss) from consolidated
investment management funds, which is included in
investment and other revenue in the consolidated
income statement.
We elected the fair value option on subordinated
notes associated with certain equity investments. The
fair value of these subordinated notes was $26 million
at Dec. 31, 2024 and $4 million at Dec. 31, 2023, and
are included in other assets on the consolidated
balance sheet. The subordinated notes were valued
using observable market inputs and included in Level
2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Note 22–Commitments and contingent
liabilities
Off-balance sheet arrangements
In the normal course of business, various
commitments and contingent liabilities are
outstanding that are not reflected in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending
commitments, letters of credit and securities lending
indemnifications. We assume these risks to reduce
interest rate and foreign currency risks, to provide
customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity
needs and to hedge foreign currency and interest rate
risks. These items involve, to varying degrees, credit,
foreign currency and interest rate risks not recognized
on the balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet risks are
managed and monitored in manners similar to those
used for on-balance sheet risks.
The following table presents a summary of our offbalance sheet credit risks.
Off-balance sheet credit risks Dec. 31,
2024

(in millions) 2023
Lending commitments $ 52,581 $ 46,518

Commercial letters of credit 24 41
Securities lending indemnifications (b)(c) 544,601 492,739
(a) Net of participations totaling $192 million at Dec. 31, 2024
and $163 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
(b) Excludes the indemnification for securities for which BNY
acts as an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, which
totaled $60 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $59 billion at Dec.
31, 2023.
(c) Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $59
billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $45 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The total potential loss on undrawn lending
commitments, standby and commercial letters of
credit, and securities lending indemnifications is
equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon,
which does not consider the value of any collateral.
Since many of the lending commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
192 BNY
does not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. A summary of lending commitment
maturities is as follows: $32.7 billion in less than one
year, $19.4 billion in one to five years and $440
million over five years.
SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate
clients and were collateralized with cash and
securities of $173 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $158
million at Dec. 31, 2023. At Dec. 31, 2024, $1.3
billion of the SBLCs will expire within one year and
$298 million in one to five years. No SBLCs expire
in over five years.
We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair
value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. The fair value of the liability, which was
recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets,
was estimated as the present value of contractual
customer fees. The estimated liability for losses
related to SBLCs and foreign and other guarantees, if
any, is included in the allowance for lending-related
commitments.
Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored
using both historical performance and internal ratings
criteria. BNY’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for payment/
performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs by
investment grade:
Standby letters of credit Dec. 31,
2024
Dec. 31,
2023
Investment grade 67% 74%
Non-investment grade 33% 26%
A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for
the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer.
Although the commercial letter of credit is contingent
upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, it
represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on
the underlying transaction. As a result, the total
contractual amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. Commercial letters of
credit totaled $24 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $41
million at Dec. 31, 2023.
We expect many of the lending commitments and
letters of credit to expire without the need to advance
any cash. The revenue associated with guarantees
frequently depends on the credit rating of the obligor
and the structure of the transaction, including
collateral, if any. The allowance for lending-related
commitments was $72 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and
$87 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
A securities lending transaction is a fully
collateralized transaction in which the owner of a
security agrees to lend the security (typically through
an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York Mellon)
to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or bank, on an
open, overnight or term basis, under the terms of a
prearranged contract.
We typically lend securities with indemnification
against borrower default. We generally require the
borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value
of 102% of the fair value of the securities borrowed,
which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing
credit risk. Market risk can also arise in securities
lending transactions. These risks are controlled
through policies limiting the level of risk that can be
undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications
were secured by collateral of $574 billion at Dec. 31,
2024 and $518 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY and the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities. CIBC
Mellon, BNY and CIBC jointly and severally
indemnify securities lenders against specific types of
borrower default. At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023, $60 billion and $59 billion, respectively, of
borrowings at CIBC Mellon, for which BNY acts as
agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, were secured
by collateral of $64 billion and $62 billion,
respectively. If, upon a default, a borrower’s
collateral was not sufficient to cover its related
obligations, certain losses related to the
indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors.
Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements
In the normal course of business, we enter into
repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase
agreements that settle at a future date. In repurchase
agreements, BNY receives cash from and provides
securities as collateral to a counterparty at settlement.
In reverse repurchase agreements, BNY advances
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 193
cash to and receives securities as collateral from the
counterparty at settlement. These transactions are
recorded on the consolidated balance sheet on the
settlement date. At Dec. 31, 2024, we had no
unsettled repurchase agreements and $96.1 billion of
unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31,
2023, we had no unsettled repurchase agreements and
$77.9 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase
agreements.

We have significant industry concentrations related to
credit exposure at Dec. 31, 2024. The tables below

Major concentrations in securities lending are

Sponsored member repo program
BNY is a sponsoring member in the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) sponsored member
program, where we submit eligible repurchase and
reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury and
agency securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through
FICC pursuant to the FICC Government Securities
Division rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also
guarantee to FICC the prompt and full payment and
performance of our sponsored member clients’
respective obligations under the FICC Rules in
connection with such clients’ Sponsored Member
Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure
under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in
our sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights
under Sponsored Member Transactions. See
“Offsetting assets and liabilities” in Note 23 for
additional information on our repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements.
Indemnification arrangements
We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and
other similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings
related to providing financial services that are not
otherwise included above. Insurance has been
purchased to mitigate certain of these risks.
Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts
included in these indemnifications and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for
indemnification are not expected to occur.
Furthermore, often counterparties to these
transactions provide us with comparable
indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to
the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority
of such indemnifications, we are unable to predict the
nature of events that would trigger indemnification or
the level of indemnification for a certain event. We
believe, however, that the possibility that we will
have to make any material payments for these
indemnifications is remote. At Dec. 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, we have not recorded any material
liabilities under these arrangements.
Clearing and settlement exchanges
We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or
member of, several industry clearing or settlement
exchanges through which foreign exchange,
securities, derivatives or other transactions settle.
Certain of these industry clearing and settlement
exchanges require their members to guarantee their
obligations and liabilities and/or to provide liquidity
support in the event other members do not honor their
obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member)
would become insolvent is remote. Additionally,
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
194 BNY
certain settlement exchanges have implemented loss
allocation policies that enable the exchange to
allocate settlement losses to the members of the
exchange. It is not possible to quantify such mark-tomarket loss until the loss occurs. Any ancillary costs
that occur as a result of any mark-to-market loss
cannot be quantified. In addition, we also sponsor
clients as members on clearing and settlement
exchanges and guarantee their obligations. At Dec.
31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we did not record any
material liabilities under these arrangements.
Legal proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New
York Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are
routinely named as defendants in or made parties to
pending and potential legal actions. We also are
subject to governmental and regulatory examinations,
information-gathering requests, investigations and
proceedings (both formal and informal). Claims for
significant monetary damages are often asserted in
many of these legal actions, while claims for
disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such
matters given their complexity and the particular facts
and circumstances at issue in each of these matters.
However, on the basis of our current knowledge and
understanding, we do not believe that judgments,
settlements or orders, if any, arising from these
matters (either individually or in the aggregate, after
giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance
coverage) will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY,
although they could have a material effect on our
results of operations in a given period.
In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes
in litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where
(i) the damages sought are substantial or
indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early
stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel legal theories
or a large number of parties, as a matter of course
there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the
timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and
regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated
with each such matter. In accordance with applicable
accounting guidance, we establish accruals for
litigation and regulatory matters when those matters
proceed to a stage where they present loss
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably
estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible
exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued.
We regularly monitor such matters for developments
that could affect the amount of the accrual, and will
adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the loss
contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual
and the matter continues to be monitored for any
developments that would make the loss contingency
both probable and reasonably estimable. We believe
that our accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate
and, in the aggregate, are not material to the
consolidated financial position of BNY, although
future accruals could have a material effect on the
results of operations in a given period. In addition, if
we have the potential to recover a portion of an
estimated loss from a third party, we record a
receivable up to the amount of the accrual that is
probable of recovery.
For certain of those matters described here for which
a loss contingency may, in the future, be reasonably
possible (whether in excess of a related accrued
liability or where there is no accrued liability), BNY
is currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably
possible loss. For those matters described here where
BNY is able to estimate a reasonably possible loss,
the aggregate range of such reasonably possible loss
is up to $690 million in excess of the accrued liability
(if any) related to those matters. For matters where a
reasonably possible loss is denominated in a foreign
currency, our estimate is adjusted quarterly based on
prevailing exchange rates. We do not consider
potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.
The following describes certain judicial, regulatory
and arbitration proceedings involving BNY:
Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY has been named as a defendant in a number of
legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that
the trustee has expansive duties under the governing
agreements, including the duty to investigate and
pursue breach of representation and warranty claims
against other parties to the MBS transactions. Two
actions commenced in December 2015 and February
2017 are pending in New York federal court. In New
York state court, five actions are pending: two related
cases commenced in September 2021 and October
2022; and three related cases commenced in October
2021, December 2021 and February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC became a
clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of
entities ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford
(“Stanford”). Stanford International Bank, also
controlled by Stanford, issued certificates of deposit
(“CDs”). Some investors allegedly wired funds from
their SGC accounts to purchase CDs. In 2009, the
Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in connection
with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed
two putative class action proceedings against
Pershing LLC: one in November 2009 in Texas
federal court, and one in May 2016 in New Jersey
federal court. On Nov. 5, 2021, the court dismissed
the class action filed in New Jersey. Both matters
have concluded. Three lawsuits remain against
Pershing LLC in Louisiana and New Jersey federal
courts, which were filed in January 2010, October
2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that
Pershing LLC, as SGC’s clearing firm, assisted
Stanford in a fraudulent scheme and assert
contractual, statutory and common law claims. In
March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative
class action against The Bank of New York Mellon in
New Jersey federal court, making the same
allegations as in the prior actions brought against
Pershing LLC. On Nov. 12, 2021, the court
dismissed the class action against The Bank of New
York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022, an appeals court
reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the
trial court for further proceedings. On June 28, 2024,
an unincorporated association that claims to represent
the interests of Stanford investors filed a lawsuit in
New Jersey federal court against The Bank of New
York Mellon, making the same allegations as prior
cases. All of the cases that have been brought in
federal court have been consolidated in Texas federal
court for discovery purposes. Various alleged
Stanford CD purchasers asserted similar claims in
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(“FINRA”) arbitration proceedings.
Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A. (“DTVM”), a
subsidiary that provides asset services in Brazil, acts
as administrator for certain investment funds in which
a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for
losses related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due
diligence of and exert control over the manager. On
March 12, 2015, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de
Janeiro against DTVM and BNY Administração de
Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”) alleging failure to properly
perform duties relating to another fund of which
DTVM is administrator and Ativos is manager. On
Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos Profissionais dos
Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal workers
association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses.
On March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed
without prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4,
2021, the appellate court overturned the dismissal and
sent the lawsuit to a state lower court. On March 2,
2023, DTVM appealed the August 4 decision to
Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice. On Dec. 17, 2015,
Postalis filed three lawsuits in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM and Ativos alleging failure to properly
perform duties with respect to investments in several
other funds. On May 20, 2021, the court in one of
those lawsuits entered a judgment of approximately
$3 million against DTVM and Ativos. DTVM
appealed and, on June 7, 2022, the appellate court
partially granted and partially denied the appeal,
reducing the judgment to approximately $2 million.
On July 13, 2023, DTVM and Ativos filed a further
appeal to Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice, which
was denied on Sept. 20, 2024. DTVM and Ativos
further appealed, but their appeal was denied on Dec.
3, 2024. On Aug. 24, 2022, the court dismissed one
of the other lawsuits. Postalis appealed that decision,
but Postalis’s appeal was denied on Oct. 24, 2023.
Postalis further appealed; that further appeal was
denied on Oct. 22, 2024. On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis
filed a lawsuit in Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and
BNY Alocação de Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação de
Patrimônio”), an investment management subsidiary,
alleging failure to properly perform duties and
liability for losses with respect to investments in
various funds of which the defendants were
administrator and/or manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the
Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service filed a civil
lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM alleging liability
for Postalis losses based on alleged failures to
properly perform certain duties as administrator to
certain funds in which Postalis invested or as
controller of Postalis’s own investment portfolio. On
April 18, 2018, the court dismissed the lawsuit
without prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021, the appellate
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
196 BNY
court overturned the dismissal and returned the
lawsuit to the lower court. DTVM appealed, but that
appeal was denied on Aug. 21, 2023. In addition, the
Tribunal de Contas da União (“TCU”), an
administrative tribunal, has initiated proceedings with
the purpose of determining liability for losses to four
investment funds administered by DTVM in which
Postalis was an investor. On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU
rendered a decision in one of the proceedings, finding
DTVM and two former Postalis directors jointly and
severally liable for approximately $50 million. TCU
also imposed on DTVM a fine of approximately $2
million. DTVM’s administrative appeal of the
decision was denied. On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed
a lawsuit in Brazil federal court in Brasilia seeking
annulment of TCU’s decision and an injunction
preventing TCU from enforcing the judgment. On
Aug. 24, 2022, the Brazilian Federal Attorneys filed
an action in Rio de Janeiro court seeking to enforce
the fine portion of the judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022,
the Brasilia federal court in the annulment action
granted DTVM’s request for an injunction,
suspending the Sept. 9, 2020, TCU decision until the
annulment action is decided. On Oct. 4, 2019,
Postalis and another pension fund filed a request for
arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and Ativos
alleging liability for losses to an investment fund for
which DTVM was administrator and Ativos was
manager. On March 26, 2021, DTVM and Ativos
filed a lawsuit in São Paulo challenging the
Arbitration Court’s jurisdiction over the case. On
Feb. 24, 2023, the São Paulo court annulled the
Arbitration Court’s decision that it had jurisdiction,
and Postalis and the other pension fund appealed. On
April 8, 2024, the appellate court reversed the São
Paulo court’s decision and found that the Arbitration
Court did have jurisdiction. DTVM and Ativos
appealed; that appeal was denied on April 8, 2024.
DTVM and Ativos have further appealed. The
arbitration continues during the further appeal. On
Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de
Janeiro against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio,
alleging liability for losses in another fund for which
DTVM was administrator and Alocação de
Patrimônio and Ativos were managers. On May 9,
2022, the court found DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio jointly and severally liable for
approximately $20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022,
DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio appealed the
decision. On April 30, 2024, the appeals court
reversed the finding against DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio. Postalis appealed that reversal and, on
Oct. 3, 2024, its appeal was denied. Postalis has filed
a further appeal. On June 19, 2020, a lawsuit was
filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM, Postalis, and various other defendants
alleging liability against DTVM for certain Postalis
losses in an investment fund of which DTVM was
administrator. On Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another
pension fund served DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio
de Janeiro, alleging liability for losses in another
investment fund for which DTVM was administrator
and the other defendant was manager.
Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de
Investimento em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial
Silverado Maximum (“Silverado Maximum Fund”),
which invests in commercial credit receivables. On
June 2, 2016, the Silverado Maximum Fund sued
DTVM in its capacity as administrator, along with
Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco Alemão in its capacity
as custodian and Silverado Gestão e Investimentos
Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager. The
Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the
Fund for which the defendants are jointly and
severally liable. On March 21, 2024, the São Paulo
court issued a decision finding DTVM, Deutsche
Bank and Silverado Gestão e Investimentos jointly
liable for losses to the Fund in an amount to be
determined during a later calculation phase. On Sept.
12, 2024, DTVM filed an appeal.
German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity
securities on or shortly before the dividend date, but
settled after that date, potentially resulting in an
unwarranted refund of withholding tax. German
authorities have taken the view that past cum/ex
trading may have resulted in tax avoidance or
evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY have been
informed by German authorities about investigations
into potential cum/ex trading by certain third-party
investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries had
acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We
have received information requests from the
authorities relating to pre-acquisition activity and are
cooperating fully with those requests. In August
2019, the District Court of Bonn ordered that one of
these subsidiaries be joined as a secondary party in
connection with the prosecution of unrelated
individual defendants. Trial commenced in
September 2019. In March 2020, the court stated that
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 197
it would refrain from taking action against the
subsidiary in order to expedite the conclusion of the
trial. The court convicted the unrelated individual
defendants, and determined that the cum/ex trading
activities of the relevant third-party investment funds
were unlawful. In November and December 2020
and February 2023, we received secondary liability
notices from the German tax authorities totaling
approximately $150 million (at then-prevailing
exchange rates) related to pre-acquisition activity in
various funds for which the entities we acquired were
depositary and/or fund manager. We have appealed
the notices. In connection with the acquisition of the
subject entities, we obtained an indemnity for
liabilities from the sellers that we intend to pursue as
necessary.
Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to requests for
information from the SEC and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission concerning compliance
with recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved
electronic communication platforms. SEC and CFTC
have been conducting similar inquiries into
recordkeeping practices at other financial institutions.
On Aug. 14, 2024, the SEC issued an order under
which the Company agreed to pay a $40 million
penalty and to certain undertakings to resolve the
SEC matter. The fine has been paid, and the
Company is complying with the other settlement
terms. The Company continues to cooperate with the
CFTC’s inquiry.
Pershing LLC Rule 15c3-3 Matter
The Company has been responding to investigative
requests for information and records from the SEC
concerning Pershing LLC’s compliance with its
obligations under SEC Rule 15c3-3, among other
regulatory rules and statutes. The Company
continues to cooperate with the inquiry.
Note 23–Derivative instruments
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market
risk, including interest rate risk, equity price risk and
foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our
trading activities are focused on acting as a marketmaker for our customers and facilitating customer
trades in compliance with the Volcker Rule.
The notional amounts for derivative financial
instruments express the dollar volume of the
transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller.
We perform credit reviews and enter into netting
agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize
the credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We
enter into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to
foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risk.
Use of derivative financial instruments involves
reliance on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty
to honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a
risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative
contract. There were no counterparty default losses
recorded in 2024.
Hedging derivatives
We utilize interest rate swap agreements, including
forward starting swaps, to manage our exposure to
interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair value
hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy to
reduce fair value variability by converting certain
fixed rate interest payments associated with availablefor-sale securities, loans and long-term debt to
floating interest rates. We also utilize interest rate
swaps and forward exchange contracts as cash flow
hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate and
foreign exchange rate changes. In designating
interest rate swaps as hedges, we utilize both partialterm and full-term hedge strategies.
The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of
U.S. Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial
MBS, agency and non-agency RMBS, non-U.S.
government and foreign covered bonds. At Dec. 31,
2024, $36.9 billion par value of available-for-sale
securities were hedged with interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges that had notional
values of $36.9 billion.
At Dec. 31, 2024, $1.4 billion of interest rate swaps
was designated as portfolio layer method fair value
hedges of loans against a closed portfolio of fixed rate
loans of $3.2 billion, essentially converting $1.4
billion of such fixed rate loans to a floating rate.
The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged
generally have original maturities of five to 30 years.
In fair value hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is
hedged with “receive fixed rate, pay variable rate”
swaps. At Dec. 31, 2024, $28.5 billion par value of
debt was hedged with interest rate swaps designated
as fair value hedges that had notional values of $28.5
billion.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
198 BNY
In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange
contracts as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange
exposures. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to convert certain
forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and expenses into
U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts with maturities of 15 months or less as cash
flow hedges to hedge our foreign exchange exposure
to currencies such as the Indian rupee, Polish zloty,
Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British pound
and euro used in revenue and expense transactions for
entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the hedged forecasted
foreign currency transactions and designated forward
foreign exchange contract hedges were $765 million
(notional), with a pre-tax loss of $4 million recorded
in accumulated OCI. Over the next 12 months, a loss
of $6 million will be reclassified into earnings.
From time-to-time, we have utilized forward foreign
exchange contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign
exchange risk associated with available-for-sale
securities. Forward points are designated as an
excluded component and amortized into earnings
over the hedge period. At Dec. 31, 2024, there were
no remaining foreign exchange contracts.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to
hedge the value of our net investments in foreign
subsidiaries. These forward foreign exchange
contracts have maturities of less than one year. The
derivatives employed are designated as hedges of
changes in value of our foreign investments due to
exchange rates. The change in fair market value of
these forward foreign exchange contracts is reported
within foreign currency translation adjustments in
shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At Dec. 31, 2024,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
amounts totaling $11.3 billion were designated as net
investment hedges.
From time-to-time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments
in foreign subsidiaries. At Dec. 31, 2024, there were
no non-derivative financial instruments hedging our
net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating economic hedging in
compliance with the Volcker Rule. The change in the
fair value of the derivatives utilized in our trading
activities is recorded in foreign exchange revenue and
investment and other revenue on the consolidated
income statement.
The following table presents our foreign exchange
revenue and other trading revenue.
Foreign exchange revenue and
other trading revenue Year ended Dec. 31,
(in millions) 2024 2023 2022
Foreign exchange revenue $ 688 $ 631 $ 822
Other trading revenue 314 231 149
Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options, as well as foreign
currency remeasurement. Other trading revenue
reflects results from trading in cash instruments,
including fixed income and equity securities, and
trading and economic hedging activity with nonforeign exchange derivatives.
We also use derivative financial instruments as riskmitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes
hedging the foreign currency, interest rate or market
risks inherent in some of our balance sheet exposures,
such as seed capital investments and deposits, as well
as certain investment management fee revenue
streams. We also use total return swaps to
economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return
linked to the performance of investments they select.
The gains or losses on these total return swaps are
recorded in staff expense on the consolidated income
statement and were gains of $18 million in 2024 and
$22 million in 2023 and a loss of $43 million in 2022.
We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity
measures. Risk is monitored and reported to senior
management by a separate unit, independent from
trading, on a daily basis. Based on certain
assumptions, the VaR methodology is designed to
capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss
from adverse changes in fair values of all trading
positions. The calculation assumes a one-day holding
period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. The
VaR model is one of several statistical models used to
develop economic capital results, which are allocated
to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted
performance.
VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable
to extraordinary financial, economic or other
occurrences. As a result, the risk assessment process
includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the
risk factors in the portfolio and management’s
assessment of market conditions. Additional stress
scenarios based upon historical market events are also
performed. Stress tests may incorporate the impact of
reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme
scenarios. VaR and other statistical measures, stress
testing and sensitivity analysis are incorporated into
other risk management materials.
Counterparty credit risk and collateral
We assess the credit risk of our counterparties
through regular examination of their financial
statements, confidential communication with the
management of those counterparties and regular
monitoring of publicly available credit rating
information. This and other information is used to
develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.
Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged
in the form of cash and/or highly liquid government
securities. Collateral requirements are monitored and
adjusted daily.
Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 20.
Disclosure of contingent features in OTC derivative
instruments
Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

collateral or the right to terminate the contracts in a
net liability position.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of
OTC derivative contracts in net liability positions that
contained credit risk-contingent features and the
value of collateral that has been posted.
Dec. 31,
2024
Dec. 31,
(in millions) 2023
Aggregate fair value of OTC derivatives
in net liability positions (a) $ 2,163 $ 1,003
Collateral posted $ 1,940 $ 1,001
(a) Before consideration of cash collateral.
The aggregate fair value of OTC derivative contracts
containing credit risk-contingent features can
fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in
market conditions, composition of counterparty
trades, new business or changes to the contingent
features.
The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our
OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements. As such, the contingent features may be
triggered if The Bank of New York Mellon’s longterm issuer rating were downgraded.
The following table shows the fair value of contracts
falling under early termination provisions that were in
net liability positions for three key ratings triggers.
Potential close-out exposures (fair value) (a)

(a) The amounts represent potential total close-out values if The
Bank of New York Mellon’s long-term issuer rating were to
immediately drop to the indicated levels, and do not reflect
collateral posted.
(b) Represents ratings by Moody’s/S&P.
If The Bank of New York Mellon’s debt rating had
fallen below investment grade on Dec. 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, existing collateral arrangements would
have required us to post additional collateral of $351
million and $235 million, respectively.

BNY’s repurchase agreements and securities lending
transactions primarily encounter risk associated with
liquidity. We are required to pledge collateral based
on predetermined terms within the agreements. If we
were to experience a decline in the fair value of the
collateral pledged for these transactions, we could be
required to provide additional collateral to the
counterparty, therefore decreasing the amount of
assets available for other liquidity needs that may
arise. BNY also offers tri-party collateral agency
services in the tri-party repo market where we are
exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate this risk,
we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.
Note 24–Business segments
We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our three principal business segments and the Other
segment.
The primary products and services and types of
revenue in each line of business and a description of

Business accounting principles
Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than
GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial
reporting. These measurement principles are
designed so that reported results of the businesses
will track their economic performance.
Our business segments are consistent with the
structure used by the President and Chief Executive
Officer, our Chief Operating Decision Maker
(“CODM”), to make key operating decisions and
assess performance. Our CODM evaluates the
business segments’ operating performance primarily
based on fee and other revenue, total revenue, income
before income taxes, and pre-tax operating margin.
The significant expense information regularly
provided to and reviewed by the CODM is total
noninterest expense. The CODM considers this
information when evaluating the performance of each
business segment and making decisions about
allocating capital and other resources to each business
segment.
Business segment results are subject to
reclassification when organizational changes are
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. In 2024, we made
certain realignments of similar products and services
within our lines of business. The largest change was
the movement of Institutional Solutions from
Pershing to Clearance and Collateral Management,
both in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment. We made other smaller changes that moved
activity from Asset Servicing in the Securities
Services business segment to Treasury Services in the
Market and Wealth Services business segment, and
from Wealth Management in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment and Pershing
in the Market and Wealth Services business segment
to Investment Management in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment. The Other
segment was not impacted by the changes. Business
segment results for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022
have been revised to reflect these changes.
The accounting policies of the businesses are the
same as those described in Note 1.
The results of our business segments are presented
and analyzed on an internal management reporting
basis.
• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue
generated by each business and include revenue
for services provided between the segments that
are also provided to third parties. Fee and other
revenue transferred between businesses under
revenue transfer agreements is included within
other fees in each segment.
• Revenues and expenses associated with specific
client bases are included in those businesses. For
example, foreign exchange activity associated
with clients using custody products is included in
the Securities Services segment.
• Net interest income is allocated to businesses
based on the yields on the assets and liabilities
generated by each business. We employ a funds
transfer pricing system that matches funds with
the specific assets and liabilities of each business
based on their interest sensitivity and maturity
characteristics.
• The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each
segment.
• Incentives expense related to restricted stock and
RSUs is allocated to the segments.
• Support and other indirect expenses, including
services provided between segments that are not
provided to third parties or not subject to a
revenue transfer agreement, are allocated to
businesses based on internally developed
methodologies and reflected in noninterest
expense.
• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the
businesses based on average deposits generated
within each business.
• Severance expense is recorded in the segments
based on the business or function the impacted
employees reside, with severance expense related
to corporate staff, technology and operations
reflected in the Other segment.
• Litigation expense is generally recorded in the
business in which the charge occurs.
• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared
service contained in the Other segment. As a
result, gains and losses associated with the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
206 BNY
valuation of the securities portfolio are generally
included in the Other segment.
• Client deposits serve as the primary funding
source for our securities portfolio. We typically
allocate all interest income to the businesses
generating the deposits.
• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their
related income or expense are specifically
assigned to each business. Segments with a net
liability position have been allocated assets.
• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected
within individual businesses.
The following consolidating schedules present the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability.

Note 25–International operations
International activity includes investment services fee
revenue and investment management and
performance fee revenue generating businesses,
foreign exchange trading activity, loans and other
revenue producing assets and transactions in which
the customer is domiciled outside of the U.S. and/or
the international activity is resident at an international
entity. Due to the nature of our international and
domestic activities, it is not possible to precisely
distinguish our international operations between
internationally and domestically domiciled customers.
As a result, it is necessary to make certain subjective
assumptions such as:
• Income from international operations is
determined after internal allocations for interest
income, taxes, expenses and provision for credit
losses.
• Expense charges to international operations
include those directly incurred in connection with
such activities, as well as an allocable share of
general support and overhead charges.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
and subsidiaries (BNY) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income,
comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion,
the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of BNY as of
December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), BNY’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified
opinion on the effectiveness of BNY’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of BNY’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to BNY in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as
a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Quantitative component of BNY’s pooled allowance for credit losses for loans and lending-related
commitments related to higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans
secured by commercial real estate
As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, BNY’s allowance for credit losses
for loans and lending-related commitments (ACL), is presented as a valuation allowance to loans and is
recorded in other liabilities for lending-related commitments. At December 31, 2024, BNY had an allowance
for loan losses of $294 million and an allowance for lending-related commitments of $72 million. BNY
utilizes a quantitative methodology and qualitative framework for determining the ACL for loans and
lending-related commitments that share similar risk characteristics (pooled allowance). In estimating the
quantitative component, BNY uses models and methodologies that categorize financial assets based on
product type, collateral type, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including relevant information
about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions that affect the collectability of the recorded amounts. The quantitative component of the ACL for
loans and lending-related commitments consists of the following three elements: (1) a pooled allowance for
higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real
estate; (2) a pooled allowance for residential mortgage loans; and (3) an asset-specific allowance involving
individually evaluated credits of $1 million or greater. In estimating the quantitative component of the pooled
allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by
commercial real estate, BNY uses a methodology that applies the probability of default (PD) and loss given
default (LGD) to the estimated facility amount at default. In order to capture the unique risks of the
portfolios within the PD and LGD models, and the model used to estimate the facility amount at default,
BNY segments the portfolio into major components based on risk characteristics of the loans and how risk
is monitored. For each commercial and institutional credit, the expected loss considers the credit’s risk
rating. For each loan secured by commercial real estate, the expected loss considers collateral specific
data and loan maturity, as well as commercial real estate market factors by geographical region and
property type. The methodology incorporates a multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast of economic input
variables over a reasonable and supportable forecast period spanning the life of the asset. The reasonable
and supportable forecast period includes both an initial estimated economic outlook component as well as
a reversion component for each economic input variable. A portion of the ACL is comprised of qualitative
adjustments, based on various internal and external factors, intended to capture expected losses not
reflected in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses.
We identified the assessment of the quantitative component of the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated
and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate as a
critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective
and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated
and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate due to
significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the
methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD and LGD, the macroeconomic
forecast scenarios and weighting of each scenario used in the reasonable and supportable forecast, and
credit risk ratings for commercial and institutional credits. The assessment also included an evaluation of
the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD models as well as the macroeconomic
BNY 211
forecast assumptions. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit
evidence obtained.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to BNY’s measurement
of the quantitative component of the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and
institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate, including controls related to the:
• development and approval of the ACL methodology
• development of certain PD and LGD models
• continued use and appropriateness of certain PD and LGD models and macroeconomic forecasts
• performance monitoring of the PD and LGD models and macroeconomic forecast methodology
• determination and measurement of the significant factors and assumptions used in the PD and LGD
models and macroeconomic forecasts
• determination of the multi-scenario macroeconomic forecasts and their respective weights
• assessment of credit risk ratings
• computation, analysis, and approval of the ACL results, trends, and ratios.
We evaluated BNY’s process to develop the quantitative component of the pooled allowance for higher riskrated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate by
testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that BNY used, and considered the relevance and
reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with
specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
• evaluating the quantitative component of BNY’s pooled allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated
commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate for compliance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
• evaluating judgments made by BNY relative to the development and performance monitoring of the PD
and LGD models and macroeconomic forecasts by comparing them to relevant company-specific
metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices
• assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD and LGD models and
macroeconomic forecast methodology by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether
they are suitable for their intended use
• testing the reasonable and supportable forecast period to evaluate the length of the period by
comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends
• testing individual loan risk ratings for a selection of higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and
institutional credits by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and
any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral.
212 BNY
We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the quantitative component of
the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans
secured by commercial real estate by evaluating the:
• Cumulative results of the audit procedures
• Qualitative aspects of BNY’s accounting practices
• Potential bias in the accounting estimate.
Identification and measurement of accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies
As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, BNY establishes accruals for litigation
and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and
reasonably estimable. BNY has disclosed that for those matters described where BNY is able to estimate
reasonably possible losses, the aggregate range of such reasonably possible losses at December 31,
2024, is up to $690 million in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters.
We identified the assessment of the identification and measurement of BNY’s accruals for litigation and
regulatory contingencies as a critical audit matter. Due to the measurement uncertainty, subjective and
complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. Specifically,
this assessment included the evaluation of the subjective estimates used to determine the range of
possible exposure and the probability of the predicted outcome based on the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of the matters.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to BNY’s process to
identify, evaluate and measure accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies and the reasonably
possible losses. We performed inquiries of BNY to gain an understanding of any asserted or unasserted
litigation, claims and assessments, and significant changes in individual accruals for litigation and
regulatory contingencies. We performed inquiries of BNY’s regulators and examined regulatory reports to
gain an understanding of developments of regulatory activity and related matters that may result in the
assessment of regulatory fines or penalties. We obtained and read letters received directly from BNY’s
internal legal counsel and a selection of external legal counsel that identified and described BNY’s potential
exposure to certain legal or regulatory proceedings. For cases that have settled, we performed back-testing
analyses of BNY’s litigation and regulatory contingency accruals recorded compared to amounts paid. We
assessed the accrual for litigation and regulatory contingencies and evaluated the cumulative results of the
procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. We also evaluated the
information included within the disclosures.
Valuation of goodwill for the Investment Management reporting unit
As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of
December 31, 2024, was $16.6 billion, of which $6.0 billion is allocated to the Investment Management
reporting unit. BNY performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and an interim test is
performed when events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair
value of any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. This involves estimating the fair value of the
reporting units using an income approach which discounts estimated future cash flows that incorporate
various assumptions including a long-term growth rate.
We identified the assessment of the valuation of goodwill for the Investment Management reporting unit as
a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and
subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the evaluation of goodwill and determination of
fair value for the Investment Management reporting unit due to significant measurement uncertainty relating
BNY 213
to specific assumptions used in the valuation. Specifically, these assumptions included the discount rate
and the long-term growth rate.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to BNY’s determination
of the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions for the Investment Management reporting unit.
We evaluated the reasonableness of BNY’s long-term growth rate for the Investment Management
reporting unit, by comparing BNY’s growth rates within historical revenue forecasts to actual results to
assess BNY’s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized
skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
• Assessing the reasonableness of the valuation approach including the discount rate and long-term
growth rate assumptions used by BNY to calculate the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
• Evaluating the discount rate by developing an independent range for the discount rate used in the
valuation and comparing the inputs to the discount rate to publicly available data and assessing the
resulting discount rate
• Testing the long-term growth rate by developing an independent assumption of the long-term growth
rate and comparing the long-term growth rate to publicly available data.

4.1.5 Private Placements
You are prohibited from acquiring any security in a private placement unless you obtain prior written approval from the
Securities Trading Conduct group, your Manager and Compliance Officer. A Private Placement Form must be submitted
in Code RAP for approval:
• If you are holding an investment of a privately-held (i.e., not traded on an exchange) Firm affiliated fund and
you wish to divest all or a portion of your investment, you are required to obtain pre-approval from the
Securities Trading Conduct group prior to redemption. Refer to MySource for a copy of the request Affiliated
Fund Request form.
• The Securities Trading Conduct group will generally not approve any private placement requests that appear
to present an actual or potential conflict of interest. This includes instances where, among other things, the
opportunity is being offered to you by virtue of your position with the Firm or its affiliates or your relationship
to a managed fund or account and whether or not the investment opportunity being offered to you could be
re-allocated to a client. So that no actual or potential conflict exists between the proposed private placement
purchase and the interests of any managed fund or account, you must comply with any and all requests for
information and/or documentation necessary for the Employee Compliance/Securities Trading Conduct
group.
• Within 30 days of being designated a Monitored Employee (see Sections 4.2 to 4.4 for information), you
must disclose any existing investment in private placement securities to the Securities Trading Conduct
group who will determine if you will be permitted to continue to hold the investment.
4.1.6 BNY Affiliated Volcker Covered Funds
You are prohibited from acquiring any initial or subsequent investment in a Firm affiliated Volcker Covered Fund (Refer
to the Volcker Compliance site on MySource) unless you obtain prior written approval from the Securities Trading
Conduct group, your Manager and Compliance Officer. Unless your job duties are directly related to providing
investment advisory, commodity trading advisory or “other services” to the fund, your investment in such funds will not
be permitted. A Private Placement Form must be submitted in Code RAP for approval.
If you are newly hired and you hold an investment (either directly or indirectly) in an affiliated Firm Volcker Covered
Fund you must receive permission to continue to hold that investment. You must disclose your investment within 30
calendar days of your hire date by completing the Private Placement Form available in Code RAP. You may be required
to divest your ownership interest.
4.1.7 Ability to Request Account Statements and Trade Confirmations
For all employees, the Firm reserves the right to request accounts statements and trade confirmations when needed.
4.2 Monitored Employees
If you are determined to be at risk for receiving Firm or client information as described below, your personal trading and
accounts where you have Indirect Ownership (as defined in Section 8.1) are required to be monitored and you are thus
deemed a Monitored Employee. There are strict limitations on such trading for Monitored Employees as further described in
Section 4.4.
Monitored Employees include employees who, as a routine and normal course of their job:
• Are deemed to be at a high risk of receiving MNPI of issuer clients (generally, certain employees located in or
supporting Private Side businesses as defined by the Firm’s I-A-046: Information Barriers Policy. These are
employees who are deemed to be private under I-A-046: Information Barrier Policy.
• Have nonpublic information regarding advisory client’s purchases or sales of securities or nonpublic information
regarding the portfolio holdings of a Proprietary Fund, are involved in making securities recommendations to
advisory clients, or have access to such recommendations before they are public.
• Have foreknowledge of the clients' trading positions or plans such that the information may elevate the risk of
Front Running or similar manipulative trading.
Personal Securities Trading Policy
Policy Number: I-A-045

• Have access to inside information with respect to the Firm’s financial results in advance of such results being
released to the public.
• Required by regulation – employees who work for a Firm broker-dealer or investment adviser (or their
equivalents).
Additionally, each business unit is required to classify all employees who are Senior Directors, Managing Directors or
above as Investment/Public or Insider Risk.3
4.3 Classifications of Monitored Employees
The Firm has assigned Monitored Employees a classification that will correspond to the type of information they routinely
are exposed to in as performing their job duties. They are as follows:
Classification Type Definition
Access Decision
Maker (ADM)
Employee
Employees within BNY Investments who are Portfolio Managers or Research Analysts
and make or participate in recommendations or decisions regarding the purchase or sale
of securities for mutual funds or managed accounts. Portfolio Managers of broad-based
index funds and traders are not typically classified as ADM Employees.
Insider Risk
Employee
Employees who in the normal course of business are likely to receive MNPI
regarding issuer clients. These employees are on the “private side” of the
Information Barrier in accordance with the I-A-046: Information Barriers Policy.
Investment/Public
Employee
Employees in the normal course of business who:
• Are on the "public side" of the Information Barrier in accordance with the IA-046: Information Barriers Policy.

monitored.
• Have access to nonpublic information regarding advisory client’s purchase or
sale of securities or nonpublic information regarding the portfolio holdings of a
Firm Proprietary Fund
• Are involved in making securities recommendations to advisory clients, or has
access to such recommendations before they are public.
• Have foreknowledge of clients trading positions or plans such that the information
may elevate the risk of Front Running

Wealth businesses as well as employees in other Public side businesses or
Corporate Functions who have an elevated risk (clear access to pre-trade
settlement information) of Front Running.
• Employees of a Firm business regulated by certain investment company laws.
Examples are:
• In the U.S., employees who are “advisory persons” or “access persons” under
Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or “access persons” under
Rule 204A-1 of the Advisers Act.

You are required to file various reports via Star, the Firm’s electronic personal trading monitoring system. Required
reports must also include any securities (except those deemed exempt as defined in Section 8.1), held outside of an

You are required to file the following reports in order to be in compliance with the Policy:
• Initial Reports: Within 10 calendar days of being notified by the Securities Trading Conduct group that you
are a Monitored Employee, you must file an Initial Broker Accounts and an Initial Holdings Report. These

may require you to make manual adjustments for changes to your securities holdings (excluding exempt
securities as defined in Section 8.1 of this Policy) that occur as a result of corporate actions, dividend
reinvestments, or similar activity. These adjustments must be reported as soon as possible, but no less than
annually.

4.4.3 Account Statements and Trade Confirmations
Monitored Employees are required to provide duplicate statements and trade confirmations directly to the Firm. You
must adhere to the following requirements:
• Countries with Approved Brokers - U.S., UK, India, Singapore or Hong Kong4
-based Monitored Employees:
You must maintain all accounts with an approved broker-dealer (refer to MySource for the Approved Broker
List). Employees are required to provide account statements to the Securities Trading Conduct Team until
the account is on a feed with an Approved Broker. If you have securities held in a physical form or held
directly with an issuer, you must provide copies of account statements and trade confirmations.
Note: Certain brokers may require the account owner’s consent in order for the Firm to receive their account
information electronically (connection to the electronic feed).
• Countries without Approved Brokers: You must provide copies of account statements to your designated
local Compliance Officer or Securities Trading Conduct Team upon receipt or at least quarterly. You are also
required to enter your trade confirmation details into the Star system within 10 calendar days of the
transaction. You may be compelled to move your accounts and hold them with an electronic broker-dealer
where legally permissible and in jurisdictions where the Firm has made arrangements with a broker-dealer
to provide automated electronic feeds to the Star system. You will be notified when this requirement
becomes effective within your jurisdiction and are no longer required to manually enter your trade details
into the Star system.
• For all employees, the Firm reserves the right to request accounts statements and trade confirmations as
needed.
4.4.4 Preclearance Prior to Trading
• Monitored Employees must receive approval in the Star system to trade any security unless the security is
expressly Exempt as defined in Section 8.1 of this Policy. You must also obtain preclearance for trades made by
indirect owners.
• ETFs and Single-Stock ETFs are reportable. Proprietary ETFs must be pre-cleared prior to transacting in for
employees who are classified as ADM, Investment/Public or Insider Risk Employees.
NOTE: if you are classified as a PREG employee (see Section 4.7 of this Policy), you are only required to
preclear trades in Firm securities (equities, fixed income, or derivatives) of The Bank of New York Corporation.
• Although preclearance approval does not obligate you to place a trade, you should not seek preclearance for
transactions you do not intend to make. Do not discuss the response (e.g. approval or denial) to a preclearance
request with anyone (excluding any account co-owners or indirect owners). If you have questions regarding a
response to a trade request, contact the Securities Trading Conduct group.
• If you receive approval to trade, the trade must be executed by the close of business the following day in the
local jurisdiction. For example, if you receive approval on Monday at 3 PM EST, the preclearance is only valid
until the close of the trading day on Tuesday. You should be aware that all preclearance time stamps in the Star
system are in EST.
• You are only permitted to place day only orders which are orders that expire at the end of the trading day.
Orders that extend beyond a single trading day, such as “good-until-cancelled” or similar orders, are not
permitted.

your classification. Please check with your local Compliance Officer for additional information.

which specifically documents in writing that you are unable to direct trades in the account, you must submit a Managed
Account Form via Code RAP to determine if the account is eligible for exclusion from some of the reporting requirements,
providing duplicate account statements/trade confirms or preclearance requirements noted within this Policy. For all
managed accounts, you must add your account information in the Star system and comply

If your account is approved as managed, you are required to complete an annual certification in the Star system attesting
that the account continues to be maintained under the account provisions the Securities Trading Conduct group relied upon
to provide approval. In addition, you are required to provide copies of statements to the Securities Trading Conduct group
when requested.
4.6 Prohibition on Short-Term Trading
• Non-Firm Securities: Employees classified as ADM, Investment/Public Employee and Insider Risk are prohibited
from engaging in short-term trading. Short term trading is defined as the purchasing then selling, or selling then
purchasing, the same or equivalent (derivative) security within 30 calendar days. PREG employees are not subject
to a holding period for non-Firm securities.
• Firm Securities: All employees are prohibited from purchasing then selling, or selling then purchasing any Firm
securities (Firm securities include any securities issued by The Bank of New York Corporation and its subsidiaries,

Employees who engage in short-term trading in non-Firm securities (within 30 calendar days) or Firm securities (within 60
calendar days) will be issued a violation and any profits realized must be disgorged.
Example: Transactions resulting in a position that is liquidated (sell), and then a new position is re-established
(buy), would meet the criteria for a profit disgorgement.
• Profit is based upon the difference between the most recent purchase and sale prices for the most recent
transactions. You should be aware that profit for disgorgement purposes may differ from the capital gains
calculations for tax purposes.
• The disposition of any disgorged profits will be at the discretion of the Firm to a bona fide and legally
permitted charity. You will be responsible for any tax and related costs.
• Profit disgorgement, where applicable, is not required for any security that is deemed Exempt (as defined in
Section 8.1 of this Policy) and trades in Proprietary Funds conducted within the BNY 401(k).
4.7 Specific Restrictions for PREG Employees
Every quarter the Firm imposes a restriction on PREG employees. As such, you are prohibited from trading in the Firm’s
securities from 12:01 AM Eastern Standard Time, on the 15th day of the month preceding the end of each calendar quarter
through the first trading day after the public announcement of the Firm’s earnings for that quarter.
For example, if earnings are released on Wednesday at 9:30 AM Eastern Standard Time, you may not trade the Firm’s
securities until Thursday at 9:30 AM Eastern Standard Time. Non-trading days, such as weekends or holidays, are not
counted as part of the restricted period. At its discretion, the Firm may extend the blackout period for some or all PREG
employees. You will be notified if there is such an extension. The Firm may establish additional event-specific blackout
periods that may be applicable to any or all categories of Monitored Employees. The Firm will notify you of any additional
blackout periods.
The blackout period includes trades in various employee plans. Specifically, you may not make payroll deductions,
investment elections changes or reallocation of balances that might impact your holdings in company stock in the BNY
401(k) Plan; you may not exercise options granted through the employee incentive compensation or similar plan; you may
not enroll in, or make payroll deduction changes, in your Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
If you trade Firm securities made during the blackout period, you must unwind the trade and surrender profits as
determined by the Firm in its sole discretion. Any losses due to the unwinding are yours to incur. Further, you may be
subject to disciplinary action or referral to law enforcement when necessary.
The Firm reserves the right to restrict trading in companies in similar industries as the Firm.

Material Non-Public
Information (MNPI)
and examples
MNPI is generally defined as material information about a company (including BNY), its
securities or any financial instruments related to that company that has not been disclosed

• there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable investor would consider it
important in deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold securities/financial instruments; or
• there is a substantial likelihood it would have been viewed by a reasonable investor
as having significantly altered the “total mix” of information available.
Information about an issuer is "non-public" if:
• it is of a precise nature and is not generally available to the investing public.
Information received under circumstances indicating that it is not yet in general
circulation and may be attributable, directly or indirectly, to the issuer or its insiders is
likely to be deemed non-public information.
Most companies announce material information through a press release or a regulatory
filing (such as with the Securities and Exchange Commission) and/or a posting on the
company's website. Therefore, if it has been determined that information is material but
there is no announcement of it in any of those sources, it is likely to be non-public at that
point.
Examples of information that may, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, be
material and non-public include, but are not limited to:
• A proposal or agreement for a merger, acquisition or divestiture, or for the sale or
purchase of substantial assets.
• A tender offer, which can be material for the party making the tender offer as well as
for the issuer of the securities for which the tender offer is made.
• An extraordinary dividend declaration, change in the dividend rate or stock
repurchase policy.
• A proposal or agreement concerning the creation of a credit facility.
• A draw down on a credit facility or a liquidity problem.
• A potential default under a material agreement or actions by creditors, customers or
suppliers relating to a company’s credit standing.
• Earnings and other financial information, such as operating results, projections, a
significant restatement or large or unusual write-offs, write-downs, profits or losses.
• Pending discoveries or developments, such as new products, sources of materials,
patents, processes, inventions or discoveries of mineral deposits.
• A proposal or agreement concerning a financial restructuring.
• A proposal to issue or redeem securities, or a development with respect to a pending
issuance or redemption of securities.
• Information conveyed by a client relating to the client’s pending orders for securities/
financial instruments that would be likely to have a material effect on the prices of
those securities/financial instruments.
• Information about major contracts or increases or decreases in orders.
• Information about derivative contracts such as options, futures, and forward rate
agreements relating to an underlying security.
• The institution of, or a development in, litigation or a regulatory proceeding.
• Developments regarding a company’s senior management or board of directors.
• Information that is inconsistent with published information, especially if published in
regulatory reports or press releases.
• A significant cybersecurity incident.

Short term trading in
option positions
Opening and closing or closing and opening an option position within 30 days of each other
or opening an option position within 30 days of expiration will result in any profits being
subject to disgorgement. When opening an option position against an existing common
stock holding you must have held that position for at least 30 days to avoid any profits being
subject to disgorgement.
Private Placement An offering of securities exempt from registration under various laws and rules, such as the
Securities Act of 1933 in the U.S. and the Listing Rules in the U.K. Such offerings are
exempt from registration because they do not constitute a public offering. Private
placements can include limited partnerships, certain cooperative investments in real estate,
co-mingled investment vehicles such as hedge funds, investments in privately-held and
family owned businesses and Volcker Covered Funds. For the purpose of this policy, timeshares and cooperative investments in real estate used as a primary or secondary
residence are not considered to be private placements.
Proprietary Fund An investment company or collective fund for which a Company subsidiary serves as an
investment adviser, sub-adviser or principal underwriter. The Proprietary Fund Listing can
be found on MySource on the Compliance and Ethics homepage.
Securities/Financial
Instruments
(Collectively
“Securities”)
Any investment that represents an ownership stake or debt stake in a company, partnership,
governmental unit, business or other enterprise. It includes stocks, bonds, notes, evidences
of indebtedness, certificates of participation in any profit-sharing agreement, units in
collective investment undertakings, collateral trust certificates and certificates of deposit. It
also includes security-based derivatives and swaps and many types of puts, calls, straddles
and options on any security or group of securities; fractional undivided interests in oil, gas,
or other mineral rights; and investment contracts, variable life insurance policies and
variable annuities whose cash values or benefits are tied to the performance of an
investment account. Unless expressly exempt, all securities transactions are covered under
the provisions of this policy (See exempt securities).
Short Sale The sale of a security that is not owned by the seller at the time of the trade.
Spread Betting A type of speculation that involves taking a bet on the price movement of a security. A
spread betting company quotes two prices, the bid and offer price (also, called the spread),
and investors bet whether the price of the underlying security will be lower than the bid or
higher than the offer. The investor does not own the underlying security in spread betting,
they simply speculate on the price movement of the stock.
Tender Offer An offer to purchase some or all shareholders' shares in a corporation. The price offered is
usually at a premium to the market price.
Trading The buying or selling, including as a gift or other disposition, of a security.
Volcker Covered Fund Generally, a “Volcker Covered Fund” is a domestic or foreign hedge fund, private equity
fund, venture capital fund, commodity pool or alternative investment fund (AIF) that is sold in
a private, restricted or unregistered offering to investors who must meet certain net worth,
income or sophistication standards or is sold to a restricted number of investors.
Generally, the fund is not registered with a securities/commodity regulator and therefore
cannot be offered to the general or retail public unless the investor meets some type of
qualification to demonstrate the investor does not need the protection of the securities or
commodities regulations.
A complete list of Covered Funds can be found at the Volcker Compliance Site on MySource

Version 3.3
Policy on Rule 10b5-1 Plans
1. Summary
Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") establishes that a person can be liable for
trading on material non-public information if he or she is aware of such information when trading in securities of a public
company. However, Rule 10b5-1 also creates an affirmative defense to insider trading allegations when such trades are
made pursuant to a written plan (referred to herein as a “Rule 10b5-1 Plan” or a “Plan”) that meets the requirements set forth
in Rule 10b5-1.
All employees and directors entering into, amending or terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan with respect to Firm securities (as
such term is defined in I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy) must comply with the SEC requirements under Rule
10b5-1, including the requirement that at the time the Plan is entered into the person not be in possession of any material
non-public information (MNPI) (as such term is defined in I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy) concerning the Firm
(as such term is defined in I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy), even if the information will have been publicly
disseminated before trading under the Plan begins.
All employees and directors entering into or amending a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must provide a copy of the draft Plan or
amendment to the Legal Department or Securities Trading Conduct Team, as applicable, for review and approval at least two
weeks prior to the planned date of execution (which is the date that the Plan document is expected to be signed) and must
pre-clear entering into or amending the Plan on the date executed. All employee and director Rule 10b5-1 Plans shall comply
with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c) and this Policy. All employees and directors are responsible for ensuring that their
10b5-1 Plans are in compliance with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and this Policy. All employees and directors
terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must pre-clear terminating the Plan.
2. Purpose
In alignment with the Level 3 Policy I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy, this Policy sets out the SEC requirements
and Firm guidelines for entering into, amending, terminating and executing transactions under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan.
3. Applicability and Scope
This Policy applies to all employees and directors who enter into, amend or terminate Rule 10b5-1 Plans with respect to Firm
securities. Before entering into, amending or terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan, employees and directors should review the
below requirements and guidelines, determine his or her status under this Policy, and contact the Legal Department or
Securities Trading Conduct Team, as applicable.
1
4. Provisions of the Policy
4.1. SEC Requirements for Rule 10b5-1 Plans
In order to satisfy Rule 10b5-1, a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must be in writing and must, among other things, meet the following
criteria:
• The Plan must be entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public
information.
• The Plan must (i) specify the amount of securities to be purchased or sold and the price and date of the
purchase or sale; or (ii) include a written formula, algorithm or computer program for determining the amount
of securities to be purchased or sold and the price and date of the purchase or sale.
• The Plan cannot permit the person to exercise any subsequent influence over how, when or whether to effect
the purchases or sales.
• The Plan must provide for a “cooling-off” period between the adoption of the Plan and the commencement of
sales under the Plan. For directors and Officers, the cooling-off period must expire no earlier than the later of
(x) 90 days after the adoption of the Plan and (y) two business days after the Form 10-Q or Form 10-K is filed
for the quarter in which the Plan is adopted (capped at 120 days). For all other employees, the cooling-off
period must expire no earlier than 30 days after the adoption of the Plan.
• Directors and Officers must make certain written certifications, including that they are not aware of material
non-public information.
• A person may not have overlapping Plans for open market purchases or sales (subject to certain exceptions).
• A person may not have more than one “single trade” plan during any consecutive 12-month period (subject to
certain exceptions).
• The Plan must be entered into in good faith and not as part of a plan or scheme to evade the SEC’s anti-fraud
rules, and the person must also act in good faith with respect to the Plan.
Please note that the bullet points above are not a complete description of the requirements needed to meet the Rule
10b5-1 affirmative defense. All employees and directors are responsible for ensuring that their 10b5-1 Plan meets the
requirements needed to meet the Rule 10b5-1 affirmative defense.
4.2. BNY Guidelines for Rule 10b5-1 Plans
The Firm has adopted the following guidelines to assist in the administration of Rule 10b5-1 Plans entered into by the
Firm’s employees and directors with respect to Firm securities:
• All persons entering into, amending or terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must comply with the SEC
requirements under Rule 10b5-1, including the requirement that, at the time the Plan is entered into, the
person not be in possession of any material non-public information concerning the Firm, even if the
information will have been publicly disseminated before trading under the Plan begins.
• The following persons must pre-clear entering into, amending or terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan with the
General Counsel:
• any person designated by the Board of Directors of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation as an
“executive officer” subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (for purposes of this Policy, each an
“Officer”),
• all other members of the Executive Committee of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, and
Policy on Rule 10b5-1 Plans
Policy Number: I-C-170
2
• all members of the Board of Directors of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (together, the
“Covered Group”).
• A member of the Covered Group must provide the draft Plan or amendment to the Legal Department for
review and approval at least two weeks prior to the planned date of execution or termination. Upon approval,
the Legal Department will provide a copy of the Plan to the Securities Trading Compliance Team. A member
of the Covered Group must also pre-clear entering into or amending a Rule 10b5-1 Plan on the date the Plan
is executed and shall follow the ordinary course procedures for pre-clearing securities transactions in
accordance with the Firm’s I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy. Persons who are members of the
Covered Group may enter into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan only during an open window period.
• All other employees who are not in the Covered Group must provide the draft Plan or amendment to the
Securities Trading Conduct Team for review and approval at least two weeks prior to the planned date of
execution and must also pre-clear entering into or amending a Rule 10b5-1 Plan with the Securities Trading
Conduct Team on the date the Plan is executed. Employees who are classified as a PREG employee (as
such term is defined in the Firm’s I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy) may enter into a Rule 10b5-1
Plan only during an open window period.
• A member of the Covered Group seeking to terminate a Plan must provide notice to the Legal Department
prior to the planned termination date and pre-clear terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan on the date of termination.
All other employees seeking to terminate a Plan must provide notice to the Securities Trading Conduct Team
prior to the planned termination date and pre-clear terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan on the date of termination.
• Pre-clearance or approval of a Plan does not constitute legal advice. Even if pre-clearance or approval is
granted, the decision to enter into a Plan and the timing of the entry into such Plan is the responsibility of such
employee or director in all circumstances.
• If a Rule 10b5-1 Plan is entered into in accordance with the terms of this Policy, each transaction executed
under that Plan will be an exception to the Firm’s I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy (that is, each
transaction need not be pre-cleared and transactions may occur during a blackout period).
• An affiliated or internal broker-dealer cannot be used for a Rule 10b5-1 Plan; however, a broker that is not on
the Approved Broker List maintained by the Securities Trading Conduct Team can be used for a Rule 10b5-1
Plan because the Plan, once notice is given and the Plan is approved, is non-discretionary and therefore
exempt from the Firm’s approved broker requirement as discussed in I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading
Policy.
• Reports on Form 4 or Form 144 required to be filed by executive officers and directors subject to Section 16
of the Exchange Act should check the box to indicate that the transactions are pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan
that is “intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions” of Rule 10b5-1(c).
• Any employee or director entering into a Rule 10b5-1 Plan must at all times remain in compliance with the
Firm’s stock ownership and retention guidelines applicable to such person, as described in The Bank of New
York Mellon Corporation’s proxy statement (as the same may be amended from time to time), and the Firm
may request evidence of ongoing compliance after taking into account transactions contemplated by the Plan
(These ownership and retention guidelines generally apply to the Covered Group). A Plan (or an amendment
thereto) will not be approved if it is determined that sales under the Plan could result in non-compliance with
applicable share ownership guidelines. Further, because more shares are required to be held to meet the
ownership guidelines at lower share prices, a Plan may be required to set minimum sale prices as a condition
to approval.
• All Rule 10b5-1 Plans shall comply with the SEC’s “cooling-off” period requirements under Rule 10b5-1.
• A Rule 10b5-1 Plan modification that changes (i) the amount, (ii) the price or (iii) the timing (including the
date) of the purchase or sale of the Firm’s securities is considered a termination of such Plan and the
adoption of a new Plan by the SEC and must comply with the requirements for entering into new Plans,
including the applicable “cooling-off” period.
• Factors that should be considered when amending, cancelling or terminating a Rule 10b5-1 Plan include the
following:
Policy on Rule 10b5-1 Plans
Policy Number: I-C-170
3
• A person can terminate or amend a Rule 10b5-1 Plan at any time. If a person terminates or amends a
Plan while in possession of material non-public information, however, the termination or amendment could
call into question whether the Plan had been entered into in good faith and whether the person acted in
good faith in respect of the Plan, which could affect the availability of the Rule 10b5-1 defense for prior
transactions, or the availability of the Rule 10b5-1 defense for a subsequent Plan.
• Entering into or altering a corresponding or hedging transaction (for example, a transaction that reduces
or eliminates the economic consequences of transactions under a Plan) with respect to securities subject
to a Rule 10b5-1 Plan will result in the Rule 10b5-1 defense being unavailable for both the transaction
made pursuant to the Rule 10b5-1 Plan and the hedging transaction.
• If the broker who has been executing trades under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan goes out of business, a person may
transfer the Plan to a different broker if (i) the transfer is timed so that there is no cancellation of any
transaction scheduled in the original plan and (ii) the new broker executes transactions in accordance with the
terms of the original Plan in compliance with Rule 10b5-1(c).
• Transactions under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan can occur at any time (such as during a blackout period), subject to
compliance with (i) the SEC rules regarding entering into the Plan while not in possession of material nonpublic information and (ii) other provisions of this Policy.
• The SEC requires quarterly disclosure by the Firm on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K regarding the adoption,
termination and material terms (including the date of adoption or termination, duration and aggregate amount
of securities to be sold or purchased) of a Rule 10b5-1 Plan or other pre-planned trading arrangement
(including any plan not intended to comply with the affirmative defense requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)) by
the Firm’s directors or Officers. The Firm may, at its discretion, issue a press release or file a Current Report
on Form 8-K with respect to Rule 10b5-1 Plans for any person, including (but not limited to) the Chief
Executive Officer or other Officers.
• The maximum term for transactions under a Rule 10b5-1 Plan is 24 months from the date the Plan is entered
into.
5. Governance and Responsibilities
The following responsibilities apply to the specified roles across the Firm.
5.1. General Counsel

Section 16 Policy
1. Summary
In accordance with Section 4.1.1 of I-C-030: Legal Corporate Services Policy, this Policy is intended to facilitate compliance
with legal requirements for the execution of transactions in Company securities held directly or indirectly by Section 16
Persons (as defined in Section 7.1 of this Policy) and members of the Executive Committee (as defined in Section 7.1 of this
Policy). Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) regulates trading by executive officers,
directors and principal shareholders1
in equity securities of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (as defined in Section
7.1 of this Policy as the “Company”) and derivative securities relating to the Company. As to such equity securities and
derivatives, as defined by the Exchange Act and referred to in this Policy as “Company Equity Securities and Derivatives”,
the law restricts certain kinds of trading, prohibits short-swing profits, and imposes reporting obligations to the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on Section 16 Persons with respect to purchases and sales of such Company
Equity Securities and Derivatives.
2. Purpose
In accordance with I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy and the Directors' Code of Conduct, employees and Directors
shall comply with laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Company, including those related to insider trading. In
alignment with such policy and code, this Policy is designed to alert Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive
Committee to restrictions on trading in Company Equity Securities and Derivatives and the related reporting obligations for
Section 16 Persons in order to ensure that the Company and its Section 16 Persons comply with the requirements of
Section 16.
3. Applicability/Scope
This Policy applies to Directors (as defined in Section 7.1 of this Policy), and those persons who have been designated by
the Company’s Board of Directors as “executive officers” subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act (collectively referenced
as, the “Section 16 Persons,” as also defined in Section 7.1 of this Policy). All terms of this policy applicable to Section 16
Persons shall apply to all Company Equity and Derivatives that such person beneficially owns, as such term is defined under
the Exchange Act, and shall apply to those persons or entities for which the Section 16 Person is attributed ownership.
Portions of this Policy also apply to any person on the Executive Committee who is not a Section 16 Person. The restrictions
on Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee noted in this policy are in addition to, and not instead

Exchange Act.
of, the other restrictions on insider trading including those set forth in the Company’s I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading
Policy, as applicable.
4. Provisions of the Policy
4.1. Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires the Section 16 Persons, as well as any principal shareholders, to report
their purchases and sales of Company Equity Securities and Derivatives to the SEC. It also prohibits certain
transactions. Ordinarily, purchases and sales of Company Equity Securities and Derivatives must be reported
electronically to the SEC within two business days of the trade date.
4.2. The Company’s Legal Department will notify employees when they become Section 16 Persons. The Legal
Department will also coordinate with the Company's Securities Trading Conduct Team of newly designated Section
16 Persons.
4.3. Company Equity Securities and Derivatives owned by a member of a Section 16 Person’s immediate family sharing
the same household are presumed to be beneficially owned by the Section 16 Person and must be reported. The
definition of immediate family for purposes of Section 16 is very broad and includes any child, stepchild, grandchild,
parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, sibling or in-laws, as well as adoptive relationships.
4.3.1. Since the definition of beneficial ownership goes beyond direct ownership, any relationship that confers (i) a
financial benefit or (ii) the ability to vote or direct the sale of Company Equity Securities and Derivatives should
be brought to the attention of the Company’s Legal Department.
4.3.2. Some limited exemptions to reporting apply, including interests in broad based indices or closed end funds that
include Company Equity Securities and Derivatives. As the rules in this area are complex, Section 16 Persons
must consult with the Company’s Legal Department before engaging in any direct or indirect transaction in
Company Equity Securities and Derivatives.
4.4. Pre-Clearance of Transactions
4.4.1. Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee are required to pre-clear any transaction in
Company Equity Securities and Derivatives by obtaining the approval of the General Counsel and the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company. This includes transactions in an employee benefit plan for which transaction
instructions are given by the Section 16 Person or Executive Committee member (e.g., orders for purchases or
sales of Company stock in such person’s 401(k) plan account), as well as gifts or similar transactions.
4.4.2. Before preclearance is granted, the Legal Department will coordinate with the Company's Securities Trading
Conduct Team to ensure all appropriate approvals have been obtained with respect to transactions for which
such preclearance is required.
4.5. Trading Blackout Period
4.5.1. Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee are prohibited from trading in Company
Equity Securities and Derivatives from 12:01 AM Eastern Standard Time, on the 31st day following the public
announcement of the Company’s earnings for that quarter through the first trading day after the public
announcement of the Company’s earnings for the subsequent quarter. For example, if earnings are released on
Wednesday at 9:30 AM Eastern Standard Time, trading may not occur until Thursday at 9:30 AM Eastern
Standard Time, at which time the trading window will open. The trading window will close at the end of the 30th
day following earnings, including the date of earnings. This period of time during which Section 16 Persons and
other members of the Executive Committee are prohibited from trading in Equity Securities and Derivatives is
known as the Trading Blackout Period.
4.5.2. This restriction includes, without limitation exercises of Company options, payroll deduction or investment
election changes that would impact future purchases in Company stock, transactions in an employee benefit
plan for which transaction instructions are given by the Section 16 Person or Executive Committee member
(e.g., orders for purchases or sales of Company stock in such person’s 401(k) plan account, as well as gifts, or

4.6. Short Swing Profits
4.6.1. Section 16 under the Exchange Act provides that any “short swing” profits on trading in Company Equity
Securities and Derivatives by Section 16 Persons inure to the benefit of and are recoverable by the Company.
Short swing profits are profits realized on any purchases and sales or sales and purchases of Company Equity
Securities or Derivatives made within any period of less than six months. Derivatives include any contract or
arrangement that depends upon the value of Company securities as the trigger for a payment or as the index for
the amount of a payment under the contract, including puts and calls.
4.6.2. For example, if a Section 16 Person buys Company common stock on January 10 at $40 per share and sells
them on May 10 at $50 per share, the Section 16 Person is liable for the $10 per share profit because the
transactions took place within six months of each other. If a Section 16 Person sells Company common stock on
June 1 for $50 per share and then buys on June 10 for $40 per share, the Section 16 Person is similarly liable
for the $10 per share difference.
4.6.3. Under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, all sale and purchase transactions are matched, regardless of
whether (a) the same shares were involved in both transactions, or (b) the Section 16 Persons were in
possession of any material non-public information. (Trading on the basis of material non-public information is
also prohibited, at all times). So long as certain criteria are met, the receipt of options or restricted stock or
restricted stock units under the Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan, the acquisition of shares under an option
exercise, the purchase of shares through the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and the reinvestment
of dividends under the Company’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan are not subject to Section 16(b); however, the
sale of any such shares is subject to the six-month matching provision in Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. To
assist with compliance obligations, Section 16 Persons should advise the Legal Department before enrolling in
any such program or other plan that involves the acquisition or disposition of Company Equity Securities or
Derivatives.
4.6.4. In addition, any transaction made by a Section 16 Person following the termination of their Section 16 Person
status continues to be subject to the Section 16 “short swing” profit rules if the transaction is executed within a
period of less than six months of an opposite-way transaction in Company Equity Securities or Derivatives that
occurred while that person was a Section 16 Person.
4.7. Short Sales Prohibited.
Short sales are sales of securities that the seller does not own at the time of the sale or borrows to consummate the sale
(even if the seller already owns identical securities — as is the case when the shareholder goes “short against the box”).
Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee cannot sell Company stock without owning it and
must deliver any Company stock they have sold for settlement within 20 days of the sale. Such prohibition is consistent
with the Company's I-A-045: Personal Securities Trading Policy prohibition on short sales.
4.8. Purchase of Company Securities on Margin is Prohibited
Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee may not purchase Company securities on margin in
any account.
4.9. Hedging and Pledging of Company Securities
The use by Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee of hedges (designed to protect against
downside market risk) or pledges (either in connection with hedging or as collateral) has the potential to expose the
Company to risk. The primary purpose of a hedging transaction with respect to the Company’s securities is to protect
from losses as a result of a decline in the market price of such securities. A transaction in which the Company’s
securities are pledged could permit a third party to conduct a forced sale of a large number of such securities under
certain circumstances. A forced sale could negatively affect the price of the Company’s securities and could raise insider
trading concerns. Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee are prohibited from engaging in
hedging transactions with respect to the Company’s securities and from pledging securities of the Company beneficially
owned by them.
Section 16 Policy
Policy Number: I-C-180

4.10. Puts, Calls and Other Options
Puts, calls and other options (other than options granted pursuant to employee benefit plans) carry a high risk of
inadvertent securities law violations. For example, transactions in put and call options for the Company’s securities may
in some instances constitute a short sale or may otherwise result in liability for short swing profits. In addition, certain put
and call options involve speculative trading involving Company securities by Section 16 Persons, which is prohibited.
Therefore, Section 16 Persons and other members of the Executive Committee may not buy or sell any puts, calls or
other options involving Company securities.
4.11. Section 16 Reporting Obligations
4.11.1. Under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, Section 16 Persons have reporting obligations that apply to ownership
of Company Equity Securities and Derivatives. Reportable transactions include gifts, grants of stock options,
and other equity awards, repricing of options, exercises of stock options, netting of shares to pay taxes, and any
kind of transfer of ownership. Transactions in employee benefit plans are also transfers of ownership for Section
16 purposes.
4.11.2. Section 16 Persons are required to file Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC reporting ownership of, and transactions
in, Company Equity Securities and Derivatives.
4.11.2.1. When a person becomes a Section 16 Person, he or she must file a Form 3 (report of initial ownership of
shares of company securities) within 10 days of the event that caused the person to become a Section 16
Person (e.g., initial employment or promotion).
4.11.2.2. Most transactions in Company Equity Securities and Derivatives must be filed on Form 4 before the end
of the second business day after the transaction is executed (the settlement date is not relevant for this
filing). All transactions (including any change in the title of an account in which Company Equity Securities
or Derivatives are held and transfers to or from trusts or other entities, including Grantor Retained Annuity
Trusts) must be reported in advance to the Company’s Legal Department for potential inclusion in a Form
4 (or Form 5, as discussed below). Prior disclosure to the Company’s Legal Department is necessary to
allow adequate time to comply with the reporting deadlines and is mandatory under this Policy.
4.11.2.3. There are limited situations where the date of execution (which starts the two-day reporting period) is not
controlled by the Section 16 Person; such a circumstance may make prior notification impossible. The
situations in which the Section 16 person may not select the date of the execution are (1) transactions
under Rule 10b5-1 plans and (2) certain transactions in an employee benefit plan. In these instances, the
Section 16 Person should advise the Company’s Legal Department before setting up such an
arrangement (as preclearance may be required) and notification to the Company’s Legal Department
must be made as soon as the Section 16 Person is notified of the execution. In certain of these
circumstances the execution or trade date is deemed to be the date on which the relevant broker, dealer
or plan administrator notifies the Section 16 Person of the execution (which cannot be more than three
days after the actual trade date). For this reason, it is essential that Section 16 Persons make
arrangements with the relevant persons to ensure prompt notification. The Company has adopted a
separate policy relating to the adoption and administration of Rule 10b5-1 plans – please refer to
corporate policy I-C-170: Policy on Rule 10b5-1 Plans for details.
4.11.2.4. In a few very limited instances, certain transactions may be reported at year-end on a Form 5 instead of a
Form 4. The Company’s Legal Department will advise Section 16 Persons as to which transactions are
eligible for delayed reporting on Form 5. A Form 5 must be filed with the SEC within 45 days after the end
of the Company’s fiscal year.
4.11.2.5. Although it is the Section 16 Person’s responsibility to file the SEC forms, the Company’s Legal
Department will assist Section 16 Persons and address any filing obligations of the Company. SEC rules
require that the Company disclose, in its proxy statement, the names of any Section 16 Persons who fail
to file a required Form 3, 4 or 5 in a timely manner.

ANNUAL REPORT 2024
UNLOCKING
OPPORTUNITY
DEAR FELLOW
SHAREHOLDERS,
ROBIN VINCE
President and Chief Executive Officer
Two years ago, near the start of my tenure as CEO,
I wrote to you that our company had yet to realize
its inherent promise and potential.
We benefited from a legacy handed to us by our
predecessors: a collection of terrific businesses
and a client franchise that would be the envy of any
company. But I think it is fair to say that we had not
played our hand as well as we could have.
In that same letter, I detailed some of the reasons:
We had largely operated in silos, particularly following
a series of mergers over several decades. We had not
taken advantage of the complementary, adjacent
nature of our businesses. We had not shown our
clients the breadth of what we could do for them.
And importantly, partly due to how we operated
and partly due to cultural factors, our people had
yet to experience what we could be as one truly
unified company.
The leadership team has been determined to address
these challenges and make more of the opportunity
provided by our clients, our business and our culture.
Those three things, coupled with our central role in
global financial markets and the trust in our brand,
created the underpinnings for our future.
One important additional insight that came from
our strategy work was that we have several
businesses that are more akin to a true financial
platforms company. This became a guide for both
our approach to delivering client solutions and
organizing ourselves. We have started to become
more for our clients by reimagining how we serve
them and found initial opportunities to run our
company better through the beginnings of an
operating model evolution.
We are humble about the work ahead, and I consider
complacency the enemy of progress. Still, there’s an
increasingly noticeable difference in the pace and
determination of the company when I enter our offices
each day, and I hear that same sentiment from our
people, clients and many of you, too.
There has been no single silver bullet; rather, we’ve
committed to our strategic pillars — to be more for
our clients, run our company better and power our
culture, each derived from our early strategy work
and the thesis that evolved from it. We’ve continued
to lay the foundation and execute against that
strategy with an increasing pace. Underscoring all
of this has been a cultural transformation as we have
increasingly come together as one BNY.
Each of these factors is essential to our progress
and our improved financial performance to date. I will
share specifics of how we’ve done this in 2024 — and
intend to continue to do so in the future — in the
sections that follow.
 BNY ANNUAL REPORT 2024 I
Last year, BNY’s 240th anniversary in business, was an exciting moment where
we doubled down on execution. Building on the solid foundation we laid in
2023, we accelerated the pace of our ongoing transformation and closed out
2024 with a strong performance, delivering record net income of $4.3 billion
on record revenue of $18.6 billion and generating a return on tangible common
equity of 23% for the year.1
1 Return on common equity was 11.9% for the year. Return on tangible common equity is a non-GAAP measure.
See “Supplemental information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 115 for a reconciliation.

Our teams recognize that it’s all about
our clients. The health of any business
depends first and foremost on providing
consistent and excellent service that
enables client acquisition, client retention
and ultimately business growth.
When we defined our strategy, we knew client obsession
needed to be central to our DNA. Given the important role
we play in the global financial system, we have long had the
privilege and responsibility of working with a significant
majority of the leading financial institutions, pension funds,
governments, insurance providers and more. These clients
often tell us that they trust us immensely, which is evident in
the fact that many have been in business with us for decades.
We realized that even with this great starting advantage, we
were not doing enough to deliver our platforms holistically to
our clients. It became our mission to determine how to unlock
growth by doing more business with existing clients. We see
this as our biggest opportunity for growth, and our value
proposition is simple: With industry-leading positions across
most of our business lines, our platforms enable us to
support clients as a comprehensive solutions provider.

 BNY ANNUAL REPORT 2024 III
That led us to the creation of our Commercial Office,
and subsequently, to update our commercial model.
Last year we developed a streamlined approach to
client service that centralizes account planning and
management and ultimately encourages our teams to be
more front-footed and proactive about connecting the
dots across the enterprise to deliver the power of one
BNY to our clients. Accountability and innovation are
important elements to this reimagining of our approach
to client coverage.
Our commercial model is designed to deliver
companywide solutions to clients at an accelerated
pace, improve the client experience and ultimately
deepen relationships. We remain focused on fueling
growth by deepening our relationships with existing
clients while also winning business with new clients
and increasing our market share. This is an ongoing
evolution, and while we are in the early days of the new
model, we are beginning to see green shoots as we
capitalize on synergies across businesses. The number
of strategic multi-line-of-business enterprise clients
has grown by over 20% over the past two years, and
sales with clients who bought from three or more lines
of business have grown more than 30% year-over-year.
At the same time, we want to improve how we adapt
and innovate to ensure our products and services
anticipate client needs, bridging gaps where necessary.
Delivering and bundling solutions that leverage the
power of our capabilities is an important way for us
to drive top-line growth.
Our acquisition of Archer last fall is a good example
of BNY becoming an end-to-end provider — in this
case, across the entire managed account ecosystem,

IV BNY ANNUAL REPORT 2024
The first two years in our platforms journey, 2022 and
2023, were centered on design and testing. This is
something we should do only once. In 2024, we began
execution in earnest and transitioned approximately
one-quarter of the company into the new model.
As we progressed, we learned and adjusted, and in
2025 we will transition the majority of the company
into our new way of working.
The Platforms Operating Model is a significant
initiative, but it is a means to an end, aimed at
simplification and increased velocity; a contributor
to top-line revenue growth as well as expenses and
efficiency. It is, however, just one change, albeit
an important one. Beyond the operating evolution,
we recognize that we must also invest in growth,
scalability and further efficiency. Over the course of
2024, we increased our investments in new client
solutions, technology and our people, and we generated
approximately half a billion dollars of efficiency savings
by continuing to digitize workflows and leveraging the
initial benefits of artificial intelligence (AI).
AI is a catalyst for transformational change —
maybe as profound as the first commercialization
of electricity. We see enormous potential in AI across all
three of our strategic pillars. New solutions for clients,
significant step-function changes in efficiency and
more machine-leverage for our people.
We are early in the journey, despite the investment
so far. In 2023, we launched an AI Hub, and spent the
past year building and refining our capabilities. The
platform is designed to be general-intelligence-model
agnostic, supports multi-agentic functionality and
serves as a foundation for our digital employees of the
future. Of the hundreds of use cases our employees
have generated, we now have over 40 AI solutions in
production, touching almost every part of what
we do at our company.
As we took stock of our company
two years ago, it became apparent
that BNY was not operating as
efficiently or effectively as it could.
We took inspiration from other
industries, and though there is
no perfect solution, we realized that any organizational
model should be aligned with the inherent nature of
the business that it serves.
From this mentality arose the Platforms
Operating Model, a carefully sequenced, multiyear
transformation initiative. We decided to unite
capabilities and better organize ourselves around
the products and services we deliver to the market,
so we could do things in one place, and do them
well. By simplifying, streamlining and collaborating
through cross-functional teams, we’re able to create
more intuitive client journeys, improve our ability to
anticipate unmet needs and accelerate speed
to market across the firm.
RUN OUR
COMPANY
BETTER
through BNY Pershing or servicing through Archer.
It also ensured we could be full-service across the
three wrappers of mutual funds, ETFs and separately
managed accounts. The transaction also represented
an important test for our new operating model:
onboarding Archer as a platform would provide
capabilities across Asset Servicing, Investments and
Pershing. Buying it once to serve the whole company,
shedding the historical silo mentality.
Throughout 2024, we also developed numerous new
client solutions, such as CollateralOne, AltsBridge,
Virtual Account-Based Solutions and three new
products on our Wove platform for wealth advisors.
Continued product innovation will be an important
investment in the years to come.
 BNY ANNUAL REPORT 2024 V
POWER
OUR
CULTURE
Underscoring everything else,
we have started to foster a
high-performing culture that
thrives on client obsession and
ownership, centered around our
updated company principles.
Celebrating our company’s 240th anniversary in
2024 with colleagues, clients and many other
stakeholders around the world felt even more special
at a moment when our people could start to see
their hard work leaving a positive mark on this iconic
institution. Considering the transformation underway
at our company, we decided that the time was right
last summer to simplify and modernize our brand
and logo to “BNY” to improve the market’s familiarity
with who we are and what we do.
The benefits of our improved visibility in the market
have also supported our recruiting efforts to attract
top talent at every level. We see early-career
recruitment as essential to the future of our company
and have taken an intentional approach to attracting
the best and brightest people from around the world.
Three years ago, we had a minimal presence on
campuses. Today we have a highly competitive,
award-winning intern and analyst program. In 2024,
we doubled the number of interns and analysts at
BNY for the second consecutive year.
In parallel, we significantly raised the bar on
what leadership looks like at BNY. At the top of
the house, we further rounded out our executive
leadership team and introduced a more rigorous
selection process and expectations for managing
directors, who act as force multipliers for our strategy.
And throughout the company, we’ve reinforced the
fact that everyone, regardless of role or level, has
the potential to lead by role-modeling our company
principles and working to bring their teams and
colleagues along on the journey.
To support our ability to recruit and retain the
very best talent, the targeted investments we’ve
been making in the employee experience across
development opportunities, benefits and facilities
are being recognized and valued by our people.
These range from our technology-enabled learning
and feedback platforms to our industry-leading
suite of mental health and well-being benefits.
Today, our AI Hub is promoting a capability-driven
approach, creating AI-enabled solutions, deploying
them across the company and educating our people
on how to use them thoughtfully and responsibly so
they can experience tangible outcomes. It’s worth
repeating the premise here: It is early, but we
see great opportunity.
FINANCIAL
RESULTS
Our progress against each strategic pillar helped us improve our overall
performance throughout the year. We were pleased that in 2024, we delivered
strong performance against our financial goals for the year. Taken together,
significant positive operating leverage resulted in pre-tax margin expansion
and improved profitability, and we delivered attractive capital returns to our
shareholders, all of which underscored the execution of a reinvigorated BNY.

GLOBAL REACH AND SCALE
Last year, we communicated a strong value
proposition for our clients, our shareholders and
our people. We set medium-term financial targets
to improve pre-tax margin and expand profitability
and made solid progress against them in 2024.
We believe we are on the right path toward our goal
of consistently meeting or exceeding our targets
through the cycle, both firmwide and for each of
our three business segments:
Securities Services:We made progress over the
past year in going after inefficient processes and
reducing the cost to serve, driving down unit costs
by roughly 5% per custody trade and by roughly
15% per NAV in traditional fund services over the year,
for example. We have also invested in uplifting our
platforms and deepening client relationships to drive
top-line growth. This combination has resulted in an
improvement in pre-tax margin for the segment from
25% in 2023 to 29% in 2024, representing solid
progress as we aim to generate equal to or greater
than 30% pre-tax margin in this segment over
the medium term.
Market and Wealth Services:Our fastest-growing
and highest-margin business segment, including our
BNY Pershing, Treasury Services and Clearance and
Collateral Management businesses, has grown to
represent approximately half of BNY’s profits.
We most recently reported a 46% pre-tax margin
last year, in line with our medium-term target of
roughly 45% pre-tax margin for this segment. Here, we
are focused on accelerating growth through deliberate
investments, including in wealth technology, real-time
payments and the future of collateral and liquidity,
while not compromising on profitability.
Investment and Wealth Management:Our focus over
the past year, in a combination of growth and efficiency
initiatives, led to an improvement in pre-tax margin
from 12% in 2023 to 18% in 2024. We recognize we have
more work to do to reach our pre-tax margin target of
equal to or greater than 25% over the medium term,
but we remain excited about the opportunity to unlock
distribution capabilities from across BNY and expand
products and solutions, including integrated solutions
from across our lines of business.

VIII BNY ANNUAL REPORT 2024
MACROECONOMIC
OUTLOOK Looking ahead, it’s more apparent than ever that economic growth
matters. Growth is essential for progress; it fuels prosperity, and
it pays for the choices and services that define the identities of
nations. A vibrant capital market, supported by a strong financial
sector, is the foundation of a robust economy, and enabling it is a
very solid investment for any country to make.
The United States entered 2025 in a position of relative strength.
The U.S. benefits from a resilient consumer base, a robust labor
force, energy independence and burgeoning technological leadership.
Its economy has outpaced other regions over the past decade and
the new administration seems determined to accelerate the
progress already made.
Growth is, however, a competitive sport. Globally, there are early
signs of economic recovery in parts of Asia and a renewed focus on
growth in the United Kingdom and European nations. But it is still
early days. This path of divergence is likely to persist in the near term,
but there is plenty of global opportunity for broad economic success.
Nearly 40% of our business is international, and we are in the
import-export business of financial services: serving our global
clients, helping U.S. clients succeed internationally and helping
international clients bring business and investment to the U.S.
As we navigate a changing economic landscape under new
leadership in the U.S. and in many other nations around the world,
this elevation of the growth agenda across both the public and
private sectors should serve as a constructive operating backdrop
for global financial services companies like BNY, and it is one we
welcome. While I am cautiously optimistic about the outlook for the
U.S. economy and capital markets, we must remain humble and
acknowledge risks, including ongoing uncertainties and headwinds,
continued growing fiscal challenges, geopolitical conflicts, the
lingering effects of inflation and the complexities surrounding
prospective policy actions. 
2025 AND FORWARD
BNY has proudly stood at the heart of the
American financial system since its inception, and
our international footprint has played an important
role in global capital markets for over a hundred years.
Today, overseeing more than $50 trillion in assets —
the first bank in history to do so — BNY stands ready
to assist clients in navigating and benefiting from the
next phases of growth around the world, while also
helping them prepare for a range of outcomes.
As a company, we are positioning ourselves to
capitalize on several megatrends in the industry
while remaining equally focused on continued
execution against our strategic initiatives and,
ultimately, driving results.
In 2025, with our strategy set, we intend to
accelerate the pace of execution across each of
our priorities. This is not a trivial undertaking, but
we can see the path.
Effectively cross-selling and leveraging the breadth
of our business platforms is the single most
compelling growth opportunity for the company. This
year will be the first full year of our new commercial
model, and we need to seize the moment to do more
business with existing clients, gain new ones and
continue to strengthen product offerings.
Through the combination of increasing the scope
and value of client relationships, both existing and
new, while also scaling growth investments and
finding opportunities to fill gaps in the market,
 BNY ANNUAL REPORT 2024 IX
we are showing up differently for clients, with
opportunities for fee growth and revenue generation
guiding our path forward.
We will also continue to build momentum toward
simplifying how we run our company. By year-end,
around 80% of our people around the world will work
in our Platforms Operating Model, representing an
important milestone. We believe that our transition
will have a meaningful impact on BNY over the years
to come — both financially and culturally — as will
the growing adoption and investment into AI.
Our people remain the key to advancing our
ambitions. This year is about leaning into
teamwork — while continuing to raise the bar on
talent and performance. We are pushing ourselves
to be nimble and faster while working to make
BNY feel smaller, special and human.
We can do more when we work together, and we
want to build a culture where teams can collaborate
more seamlessly each day with fewer barriers
across businesses and regions. Where appropriately
questioning the status quo is encouraged to spark
progress. Where we accept that no one has all the
answers, and we all remain on a continuous learning
journey. Where people are proud and excited to come
to work each day because they feel a real sense
of community and belonging. And where we see
ourselves truly pulling together as one BNY.
MEGATRENDS
Private market assets under management (AUM)
is projected to grow at more than double the rate
of public assets over the next several years, which
is being driven by a few catalysts: the trend for
companies to stay private for longer and public
companies opting to privatize, as well as regulatory
trends. We are a leading service provider for fund
management and administration in public markets,
and the logical next step for us is to support our
clients with these same capabilities with a privatemarket wrapper. We see significant opportunities
to support our clients end-to-end — from servicing
to distribution, cash investment, FX hedging and
lending — and across traditional and alternative
asset classes. The integration of public and private
markets is a related trend, and we believe this may
favor large more integrated players who can service
across the spectrum of asset types, irrespective
of the form or type of wrapper.
CONTINUED SHIFT TOWARD
PRIVATE MARKETS
Amid rapid technological advancements, investors
are increasingly seeking out new asset classes,
additional transparency and more personalized
solutions at lower cost. Digital assets are just one
example of a new investment vehicle in which
we see significant long-term potential. As early
adopters, we have focused on digital assets and
tokenization, emphasizing regulatory clarity for
innovation and client safety. Last year, we saw
the mass adoption of digital asset exchangetraded products in the U.S., which grew to more
than $100B in AUM in less than a year. We now
provide fund services for the vast majority of these
products in the U.S. and Canada.
NEW INVESTMENT VEHICLES
We’re optimistic that policy in the U.S. and greater
collaboration across the public and private
sectors will help drive more investment, loans
and growth — resulting in higher trading volumes,
enhanced investment opportunities as well as
more equity, debt and activity in the system. Across
our company, we create, administer, distribute,
optimize, manage and transact assets, and so
this changing environment presents tailwinds
for our revenue and fee growth. Some of our
fastest-growing businesses — Treasury Services,
Clearance and Collateral Management, and
Corporate Trust — demonstrate our gearing
toward higher activity and greater volumes.
CAPITAL MARKETS ACTIVITY
The U.S. wealth market is one of the fastestgrowing segments in financial services. With
the growth of the market also comes increased
complexity as clients seek to navigate the often
confusing regulatory and compliance environment.
Through our Pershing and Wealth businesses,
we’re a leader in serving this growing segment. Our
Wealth business is focused on the faster-growing
ultra-high-net-worth space while our Pershing
business leverages the size and scale of our
platforms to power advisors’ businesses, helping
them navigate evolving client needs.
GROWTH IN THE U.S. WEALTH MARKET
Twenty years ago, a company might have seriously
considered building a proprietary email or
operating system in-house. Today, they prefer
using established technology suites and scaled
platforms rather than expending capital on their
own systems, so they can focus on revenuegenerating solutions and client benefits. We each
choose partners to allow us to focus on what
makes us special. As global markets evolve and
become ever more complex, both buy-side and
sell-side firms are looking to outsource certain
functions and consolidate providers to gain scale
and reduce risk, and the strength and connectivity
of our platforms are true differentiators.
SCALING WITH TRUSTED PROVIDERS
X 
To summarize our company’s trajectory: 2023 was about
foundation-setting, 2024 was about accelerating the pace
and 2025 represents the moment where we really begin
to unlock the opportunity.
We are still early in our journey and much of our work
today is for the future. As we look ahead, we will continue
to work hard to deliver for our clients, our people and all of
you, our valued shareholders, guided by our strategy and
with a laser-focus on consistent execution.
Thank you for your ongoing support and conviction
in all we can be as a company.
We look forward to taking the next steps of this
journey together. We’re just getting started.
ONWARD,
Robin Vince,
President and Chief Executive Officer

Summary of financial highlights
We reported net income applicable to common
shareholders of $4.3 billion, or $5.80 per diluted
common share, in 2024, including the negative
impact of notable items. Notable items in 2024
include severance expense, litigation reserves and the
net impact of adjustments for the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) special assessment.
Excluding notable items, net income applicable to
common shareholders was $4.5 billion (Non-GAAP),
or $6.03 (Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in
2024. In 2023, net income applicable to common
shareholders was $3.1 billion, or $3.89 per diluted

common share, including the negative impact of
notable items. Notable items in 2023 include the
initial estimate for the FDIC special assessment,
severance expense, the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable, litigation
reserves and net losses on disposals. Excluding
notable items, net income applicable to common
shareholders was $4.0 billion (Non-GAAP), or $5.07
(Non-GAAP) per diluted common share, in 2023.
The highlights below are based on 2024 compared
with 2023, unless otherwise noted.
• Total revenue increased 5%, primarily reflecting:
• Fee revenue increased 6%, primarily
reflecting higher market values, net new
business, higher client activity and foreign
exchange revenue, partially offset by the mix
of AUM flows. (See “Fee and other revenue”
beginning on page 5.)
• Investment and other revenue increased
primarily reflecting the reduction in the fair
value of a contingent consideration receivable
in 2023 and higher client activity in our fixed
income and equity trading business. (See
“Fee and other revenue” beginning on page
5.)
• Net interest income decreased 1%, primarily
reflecting changes in deposit mix, partially
offset by higher investment securities
portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.
(See “Net interest income” beginning on page
8.)
• The provision for credit losses was $70 million,
primarily driven by reserve increases related to
commercial real estate exposure and changes in
the macroeconomic forecast. (See “Consolidated
balance sheet review – Allowance for credit
losses” beginning on page 33.)
• Noninterest expense decreased 4%, primarily
reflecting the net impact of adjustments for the
FDIC special assessment and efficiency savings,
partially offset by higher investments, employee
merit increases and revenue-related expenses.
Excluding notable items, noninterest expense
increased 1% (Non-GAAP). (See “Noninterest
expense” on page 11.)
• Effective tax rate of 22.3% in 2024. (See
“Income taxes” on page 11.)
• Return on common equity (“ROE”) was 11.9%
for 2024. Excluding notable items, the adjusted
ROE was 12.4% (Non-GAAP) for 2024.
• Return on tangible common equity (“ROTCE”)
was 22.8% (Non-GAAP) for 2024. Excluding
notable items, the adjusted ROTCE was 23.8%
(Non-GAAP) for 2024.
See “Supplemental Information – Explanation of
GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures”
beginning on page 115 for reconciliations of the NonGAAP measures.
Metrics
• AUC/A totaled $52.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024
compared with $47.8 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The 9% increase primarily reflects higher market
values, client inflows and net new business,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar. (See “Fee and other
revenue” beginning on page 5.)
• AUM totaled $2.03 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024
compared with $1.97 trillion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The 3% increase primarily reflects higher market
values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact
of a stronger U.S. dollar. (See “Review of
business segments – Investment and Wealth
Management business segment” beginning on
page 17.)
Capital and liquidity
• Our CET1 ratio calculated under the Standardized
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 11.5%
at Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced
Approaches. The decrease was primarily driven
by capital returned through common stock
repurchases and dividends and higher riskweighted assets (“RWAs”), partially offset by
capital generated through earnings. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 39.)
• Our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at Dec. 31,
2024, compared with 6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023. The
decrease was driven by higher average assets,
partially offset by an increase in capital. (See
“Capital” beginning on page 39.)

Fee revenue increased 6% compared with 2023,
primarily reflecting higher investment services fees,
investment management and performance fees and
foreign exchange revenue.
Investment and other revenue increased $207 million
in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily reflecting the
reduction in the fair value of a contingent
consideration receivable in 2023 and higher client
activity in our fixed income and equity trading
business.
Investment services fees
Investment services fees increased 7% compared with
2023, primarily reflecting higher market values, net
new business and higher client activity.
AUC/A totaled $52.1 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024, an
increase of 9% compared with Dec. 31, 2023,
primarily reflecting higher market values, client

unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. AUC/A
consisted of 37% equity securities and 63% fixedincome securities at Dec. 31, 2024 and 35% equity
securities and 65% fixed-income securities at Dec.
31, 2023.
See “Securities Services business segment” and
“Market and Wealth Services business segment” in
“Review of business segments” for additional details.
Investment management and performance fees
Investment management and performance fees
increased 3% compared with 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the
mix of AUM flows and lower performance fees.
Performance fees were $51 million in 2024 and $81
million in 2023. On a constant currency basis (NonGAAP), investment management and performance
fees increased 2% compared with 2023. See
“Supplemental Information – Explanation of GAAP
and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on
page 115 for the reconciliation of Non-GAAP
measures.
AUM was $2.0 trillion at Dec. 31, 2024, an increase
of 3% compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar.
See “Investment and Wealth Management business
segment” in “Review of business segments” for
additional details regarding the drivers of investment
management and performance fees, AUM and AUM
flows.

Foreign exchange revenue
Foreign exchange revenue is primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by
market volatility, the impact of foreign currency
hedging activities and foreign currency
remeasurement gain (loss). In 2024, foreign
exchange revenue increased 9% compared with 2023,
primarily reflecting higher volumes. Foreign
exchange revenue is primarily reported in the
Securities Services business segment and, to a lesser
extent, the Market and Wealth Services and
Investment and Wealth Management business
segments and the Other segment.
Financing-related fees
Financing-related fees, which are primarily reported
in the Market and Wealth Services and Securities
Services business segments, include capital market
fees, loan commitment fees and credit-related fees.
Financing-related fees increased 13% in 2024
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher
underwriting fees.
Distribution and servicing fees
Distribution and servicing fees earned from mutual
funds are primarily based on average assets in the
funds and the sales of funds that we manage or
administer, and are primarily reported in the
Investment Management line of business. These fees,
which include 12b-1 fees, fluctuate with the overall
level of net sales, the relative mix of sales between
share classes, the funds’ market values and money
market fee waivers.
Distribution and servicing fees were $158 million in
2024 compared with $148 million in 2023, driven by
higher money market balances. The impact of
distribution and servicing fees on income in any one
period is partially offset by distribution and servicing
expense paid to other financial intermediaries to
cover their costs for distribution and servicing of
mutual funds. Distribution and servicing expense is
recorded as noninterest expense on the income
statement.
Investment and other revenue
Investment and other revenue includes income or loss
from consolidated investment management funds,
seed capital gains or losses, other trading revenue or
loss, renewable energy investments gains or losses,
income from corporate and bank-owned life
insurance contracts, other investment gains or losses,
gains or losses from disposals, expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture,
other income or loss and net securities gains or losses.
The income or loss from consolidated investment
management funds should be considered together
with the net income or loss attributable to
noncontrolling interests, which reflects the portion of
the consolidated funds for which we do not have an
economic interest and is reflected below net income
as a separate line item on the consolidated income
statement. Other trading revenue or loss primarily
includes the impact of market-risk hedging activity
related to our seed capital investments in investment
management funds, non-foreign currency derivative
and fixed income trading, and other hedging activity.
Other investment gains or losses includes fair value
changes of non-readily marketable strategic equity,
private equity and other investments. Expense
reimbursements from our CIBC Mellon joint venture
relate to expenses incurred by BNY on behalf of the
CIBC Mellon joint venture. Other income includes
various miscellaneous revenues.

2023-02). See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
(c) Includes strategic equity, private equity and other investments.
(d) Includes a net loss of $449 million related to the repositioning of the securities portfolio.
Investment and other revenue was $687 million in
2024 compared with $480 million in 2023. The
increase primarily reflects the reduction in the fair
value of a contingent consideration receivable in 2023
and higher client activity in our fixed income and
equity trading business.

(a) Net interest income (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP include the tax equivalent adjustments on taxexempt income, which allows for comparisons of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with
industry practice. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on net income.
N/M – Not meaningful.
bps – basis points.
Net interest income decreased 1% compared with
2023, primarily reflecting changes in deposit mix,
partially offset by higher investment securities
portfolio yields and balance sheet growth.
Net interest margin decreased 3 basis points
compared with 2023. The decrease primarily reflects
the factors mentioned above.
Average interest-earning assets increased 2%
compared with 2023. The increase primarily reflects
higher federal funds sold and securities purchased
under resale agreements, loan balances and securities,
partially offset by lower interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks and
interest-bearing deposits with banks.
Average non-U.S. dollar deposits comprised
approximately 25% of our average total deposits in
2024 and 2023. Approximately 50% of the average
non-U.S. dollar deposits in 2024 and 45% in 2023
were euro-denominated.
Net interest income in 2025 will largely depend on
the level and mix of client deposits and investment
securities portfolio reinvestment yields. Based on
market implied forward interest rates as of Dec. 31,
2024, we expect net interest income for 2025 to
increase when compared with 2024.

(a) Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $176 billion in 2024 and $111 billion in 2023. On a
Non-GAAP basis, excluding the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been
5.28% for 2024 and 5.22% for 2023, and the rate on federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 5.18%
for 2024 and 5.10% for 2023. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual
rates earned and paid.

(a) Includes the average impact of offsetting under enforceable netting agreements of approximately $43 billion in 2022. On a Non-GAAP basis, excluding
the impact of offsetting, the yield on federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements would have been 1.77%, and the rate on federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements would have been 1.67% for 2022. We believe providing the rates excluding the impact
of netting is useful to investors as it is more reflective of the actual rates earned and paid.
(b) Interest income includes fees of $2 million in 2022. Nonaccrual loans are included in average loans; the associated income, which was recognized on a

Total noninterest expense decreased 4% compared
with 2023, primarily reflecting the net impact of
adjustments for the FDIC special assessment and
efficiency savings, partially offset by higher
investments, employee merit increases and revenuerelated expenses. Excluding notable items,
noninterest expense increased 1% (Non-GAAP). See
“Supervision and Regulation – FDIC Deposit
Insurance” beginning on page 67 for information on
the FDIC special assessment. See “Supplemental
Information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP
financial measures” beginning on page 115 for the
reconciliation of the Non-GAAP measure.
We expect total noninterest expense for 2025 to
increase slightly compared with 2024, primarily
reflecting incremental investments and higher
revenue-related expenses, partially offset by the
benefit of efficiency savings.
Income taxes
BNY recorded an income tax provision of $1.3 billion
(22.3% effective tax rate) in 2024. The income tax
provision was $979 million (22.9% effective tax rate)
in 2023.
On Jan. 1, 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02,
Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures
(Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax
Credit Structures Using the Proportional
Amortization Method, on a retrospective basis. See
Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the new
accounting guidance.
For additional information on income taxes, see Note

Review of business segments
We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our three principal business segments: Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management, and the Other segment.
Business segment accounting principles
Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than
the generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) used for consolidated financial reporting.
These measurement principles are designed so that
reported results of the businesses will track their
economic performance.
Our business segments are consistent with the
structure used by the President and Chief Executive
Officer, our Chief Operating Decision Maker
(“CODM”), to make key operating decisions and
assess performance. Our CODM evaluates the
business segments’ operating performance primarily
based on fee and other revenue, total revenue, income
before income taxes, and pre-tax operating margin.
The significant expense information regularly
Results of Operations (continued)
BNY 11
provided to and reviewed by the CODM is total
noninterest expense. The CODM considers this
information when evaluating the performance of each
business segment and making decisions about
allocating capital and other resources to each business
segment.
For information on the accounting principles of our
business segments, the primary products and services
in each line of business, the primary types of revenue
by line of business and how our business segments
are presented and analyzed, see Note 24 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Business segment results are subject to
reclassification when organizational changes are
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. In 2024, we made
certain realignments of similar products and services
within our lines of business consistent with the firm’s
ongoing transition to a platforms operating model
uniting related capabilities and enabling streamlining
of internal processes to drive growth, efficiency,
resiliency, and enhanced risk management. The
largest change was the movement of Institutional
Solutions from Pershing to Clearance and Collateral
Management, both in the Market and Wealth Services
business segment. We made other smaller changes
that moved activity from Asset Servicing in the
Securities Services business segment to Treasury
Services in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment, and from Wealth Management in the
Investment and Wealth Management business
segment and Pershing in the Market and Wealth
Services business segment to Investment
Management in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment. The Other segment
was not impacted by the changes. Business segment
results for 2023 and 2022 have been revised to reflect
these changes.
The results of our business segments may be
influenced by client and other activities that vary by
quarter. In the first quarter, staff expense typically
increases, reflecting the vesting of long-term stock
awards for retirement-eligible employees. The timing
of our annual employee merit increases also impacts
staff expense. In 2024, the merit increase was
effective in March and in 2023, the merit increase
was effective in April, thus partially impacting the
full-year staff expense variances. In the third quarter,
volume-related fees may decline due to reduced client
activity. In the fourth quarter, we typically incur
higher business development and marketing
expenses. In our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, performance fees are
typically higher in the fourth and first quarters, as
those quarters represent the end of the measurement
period for many of the performance fee-eligible
relationships.
The results of our business segments may also be
impacted by the translation of financial results
denominated in foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar.
We are primarily impacted by activities denominated
in the British pound and the euro. On a consolidated
basis and in our Securities Services and Market and
Wealth Services business segments, we typically have
more foreign currency-denominated expenses than
revenues. However, our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment typically has more
foreign currency-denominated revenues than
expenses. Overall, currency fluctuations impact the
year-over-year growth rate in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment more than the
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments. However, currency fluctuations,
in isolation, are not expected to significantly impact
net income on a consolidated basis.
Fee revenue in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment, and to a lesser extent,
the Securities Services and Market and Wealth
Services business segments, is impacted by global
market fluctuations. At Dec. 31, 2024, we estimated
that a 5% change in global equity markets, spread
evenly throughout the year, would impact fee revenue
by less than 1% and diluted earnings per common
share by $0.05 to $0.08.
See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for the consolidating schedules which
show the contribution of our business segments to our
overall profitability.

Business segment description
The Securities Services business segment consists of
two distinct lines of business, Asset Servicing and
Issuer Services, which provide business solutions
across the transaction lifecycle to our global asset
owner and asset manager clients. We are one of the
leading global investment services providers with
$37.7 trillion of AUC/A at Dec. 31, 2024. For
information on the drivers of the Securities Services
fee revenue, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The Asset Servicing business provides a
comprehensive suite of solutions. We are one of the
largest global custody, fund administrator and frontto-back outsourcing partners. We offer services for
the safekeeping of assets in capital markets globally
as well as fund accounting services, exchange-traded
funds servicing, transfer agency, trust and depository,
front-to-back capabilities and data and analytics
solutions for our clients. We deliver foreign
exchange, and securities lending and financing
solutions, on both an agency and principal basis. Our
agency securities lending program is one of the
largest lenders of U.S. and non-U.S. securities,
servicing a lendable asset pool of approximately $5.4
trillion in 34 separate markets. Our market-leading
liquidity services portal enables cash investments for
institutional clients and includes fund research and
analytics.
Our Digital Asset Custody platform offers custody
and administration services for Bitcoin and Ether for
select U.S. institutional clients. Our Digital Assets
Funds Services provides accounting and
administration, transfer agency and ETF services to
digital asset funds. We continue to develop our
digital asset capabilities working closely with clients
to address their evolving digital asset needs. As of
and for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024, our Digital
Asset Custody platform and related initiatives had a
de minimis impact on our assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses.
The Issuer Services business includes Corporate
Trust and Depositary Receipts. Our Corporate
Trust business delivers a full range of issuer and
related investor services, including trustee, paying
agency, fiduciary, escrow and other financial
services. We are a leading provider to the debt
capital markets, providing customized and marketdriven solutions to investors, bondholders and
lenders. Our Depositary Receipts business drives
global investing by providing servicing and valueadded solutions that enable, facilitate and enhance
cross-border trading, clearing, settlement and
ownership. We are one of the largest providers of
depositary receipts services in the world, partnering
with leading companies from more than 50
countries.
Review of financial results
AUC/A of $37.7 trillion increased 10% compared
with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values, client inflows and net new business,
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar.
Total revenue of $8.9 billion increased 4% compared
with 2023. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.
Asset Servicing revenue of $6.9 billion increased 4%
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting higher
market values, net new business, higher client
activity, including in our fixed income and trading
business, and higher foreign exchange revenue,
partially offset by lower net interest income.
Issuer Services revenue of $2.0 billion increased 3%
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting Corporate
Trust fees driven by net new business, partially offset
by lower Depositary Receipts revenue.
Market and regulatory trends are driving investable
assets toward lower fee asset management products at
reduced margins for our clients. These dynamics are
also negatively impacting our investment services
fees. However, at the same time, these trends are
providing additional outsourcing opportunities as
clients and other market participants seek to comply
with regulations and reduce their operating costs.
Noninterest expense of $6.3 billion decreased 1%
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting efficiency
savings, partially offset by higher investments and
employee merit increases.

segment consists of two distinct lines of business,
Investment Management and Wealth Management,
which have a combined AUM of $2.0 trillion as of
Dec. 31, 2024.
Investment Management is a leading global asset
manager and consists of seven specialist investment
firms and a global distribution platform to deliver a
diversified range of investment capabilities to
institutional and retail clients globally.
Our Investment Management model provides
specialist expertise from seven investment firms
offering solutions across major asset classes, backed
by the strength, scale and proven stewardship of
BNY. Each investment firm has its own individual
culture, investment philosophy and proprietary
investment process. This approach brings our clients
clear, independent thinking from highly experienced
investment professionals.
The investment firms offer a broad range of actively
managed equity, fixed income, multi-asset and
liability-driven investments, along with passive
products and cash management. Our six majorityowned investment firms are: ARX, Dreyfus, Insight
Investment, Mellon, Newton Investment Management
and Walter Scott. BNY owns a noncontrolling
interest in Siguler Guff.
Investment Management has multiple global
distribution entities, which are responsible for
distributing the investment solutions developed and
managed by the investment firms, as well as the
management and distribution of our U.S. mutual
funds, ETFs and certain offshore money market
funds.
Wealth Management provides investment
management, custody, wealth and estate planning,
private banking services, investment servicing and
information management. Wealth Management has
$327 billion in client assets as of Dec. 31, 2024, and
more than 30 offices in the U.S. and internationally.
Wealth Management clients include individuals,
families and institutions. Institutions include family
offices, charitable gift programs and endowments and
foundations. We work with clients to build, manage
and sustain wealth across generations and market
cycles.
The wealth business differentiates itself with a
comprehensive wealth management framework called
Active Wealth that seeks to empower clients to build
and sustain long-term wealth.
The results of the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment are driven by a blend
of daily, monthly and quarterly AUM by product
type. The overall level of AUM for a given period is
determined by:
• the beginning level of AUM;
Results of Operations (continued)
18 BNY
• the net flows of new assets during the period
resulting from new business wins and existing
client inflows, reduced by the loss of clients and
existing client outflows; and
• the impact of market price appreciation or
depreciation, foreign exchange rates and
investment firm acquisitions or divestitures.
The mix of AUM is a result of the historical growth
rates of equity and fixed income markets and the
cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a
result of client asset allocation decisions. Actively
managed equity, multi-asset and alternative assets
typically generate higher percentage fees than fixedincome and liability-driven investments and cash.
Also, actively managed assets typically generate
higher management fees than indexed or passively
managed assets of the same type. Market and
regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand
for lower fee asset management products and for
performance-based fees.
Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM and the management
fees expressed in basis points (one-hundredth of one
percent) charged for managing those assets.
Management fees are typically subject to fee
schedules based on the overall level of assets
managed for a single client or by individual asset
class and style. This is most common for institutional
clients where we typically manage substantial assets
for individual accounts.
Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of a portfolio’s performance in excess of a
benchmark index or a peer group’s performance.
A key driver of growth in investment management
and performance fees is the amount of net new AUM
flows. Overall market conditions are also key
drivers, with a significant long-term economic driver
being growth of global financial assets.
Net interest income is determined by loan and deposit
volumes and the interest rate spread between
customer rates and internal funds transfer rates on
loans and deposits. Expenses in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment are mainly
driven by staff and distribution and servicing
expenses.
Review of financial results
AUM of $2.0 trillion increased 3% compared with
Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher market
values, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a
stronger U.S. dollar.
Net long-term strategy outflows were $52 billion in
2024, driven by outflows of index, equity and multiasset and alternative investments, partially offset by
inflows of fixed income and liability-driven
investments. Short-term strategy inflows were $45
billion in 2024.
Total revenue of $3.4 billion increased 7% compared
with 2023. The drivers of total revenue by line of
business are indicated below.
Investment Management revenue of $2.3 billion
increased 9% compared with 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values and the reduction in
the fair value of a contingent consideration receivable
in 2023, partially offset by the mix of AUM flows
and lower performance fees.
Wealth Management revenue of $1.1 billion
increased 5% compared with 2023, primarily
reflecting higher market values, partially offset by
changes in product mix.
Revenue generated in the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment included 30% from
non-U.S. sources in 2024, compared with 32% in
2023.
Noninterest expense of $2.8 billion was flat compared
with 2023, primarily reflecting employee merit
increases and higher investments, offset by efficiency
savings.

Segment description
The Other segment primarily includes:
• the leasing portfolio;
• corporate treasury activities, including our
securities portfolio;
• derivatives and other trading activity;
• corporate and bank-owned life insurance;
• tax credit investments and other corporate
investments; and
• certain business exits.
Revenue primarily reflects:
• net interest income (expense) and lease-related
gains (losses) from leasing operations;
• net interest income (expense) and derivatives and
other corporate treasury activities;
• other revenue from certain business exits;
• investment and other revenue from corporate and
bank-owned life insurance, gains (losses)
associated with investment securities and other
assets; and
• fee revenue from the elimination of the results of
certain services provided between segments,
which are also provided to third parties.
Expenses include:
• direct expenses supporting leasing, investing and
funding activities; and
• expenses not directly attributable to Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and
Investment and Wealth Management operations.
Review of financial results
Loss before taxes was $226 million in 2024 compared
with $867 million in 2023.
Investment and other revenue decreased $44 million
compared with 2023, primarily reflecting investment
gains recorded in 2023 and higher net securities
losses.
Noninterest expense decreased $702 million
compared with 2023, primarily driven by adjustments
for the FDIC special assessment.
International operations
Our primary international activities consist of asset
servicing in our Securities Services business segment,
global payment services in our Market and Wealth
Services business segment and investment
management in our Investment and Wealth
Management business segment.
Our clients include central banks and sovereigns,
financial institutions, asset managers, insurance
companies, corporations, local authorities and highnet-worth individuals and family offices. Through
our global network of offices, we have developed a
deep understanding of local requirements and cultural
needs, and we pride ourselves on providing dedicated
service through our multilingual sales, marketing and
client service teams.
At Dec. 31, 2024, approximately 60% of our total
employees (full-time and part-time employees) were
based outside the U.S., with approximately 10,900
employees in EMEA, approximately 18,900
employees in APAC and approximately 800
employees in other global locations, primarily Brazil.
We are a leading global asset manager. Our
international operations managed 47% of BNY’s
AUM at Dec. 31, 2024 and 51% at Dec. 31, 2023.

In Europe, we maintain capabilities to service
Undertakings for Collective Investment in
Transferable Securities and alternative investment
funds. We offer a full range of tailored solutions for
investment companies, financial institutions and
institutional investors across most European markets.
We are a provider of non-U.S. government securities,
fixed income and equities clearance, settling
securities transactions directly in European markets,
and using a high-quality and established network of
local agents in non-European markets.
We have extensive experience providing trade and
cash services to financial institutions and central
banks outside of the U.S. In addition, we offer a
broad range of servicing and fiduciary products to
financial institutions, corporations and central banks.
In emerging markets, we lead with custody, global
payments and issuer services, introducing other
products as the markets mature. For more established
markets, our focus is on global investment services.
We are also a full-service global provider of foreign
exchange services, actively trading in over 100 of the
world’s currencies. We serve clients from trading
desks located in Europe, Asia and North America.
Our financial results, as well as our levels of AUC/A
and AUM, are impacted by translation from foreign
currencies to the U.S. dollar. We are primarily
impacted by activities denominated in the British
pound and the euro. If the U.S. dollar depreciates
against these currencies, the translation impact is a
higher level of fee revenue, net interest income,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM.
Conversely, if the U.S. dollar appreciates, the
translated levels of fee revenue, net interest income,
noninterest expense and AUC/A and AUM will be
lower.

International clients accounted for 35% of revenues in
2024 and 36% in 2023. Net income from
international operations was $2.3 billion in 2024,
compared with $2.0 billion in 2023.
Revenues from EMEA were $4.3 billion in 2024, an
increase of 4% compared with 2023. The increase
was primarily driven by higher net interest income,
collateral management fees and clearance volumes in
the Market and Wealth Services business segment.
The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business
segments generated 58%, 24% and 18% of EMEA
revenues, respectively. Net income from EMEA was
$1.3 billion in 2024, compared with $1.1 billion in
2023.
Revenues from APAC were $1.3 billion in 2024, a
decrease of 1% compared with 2023. The decrease
primarily reflects lower revenue in the Market and
Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management business segments, partially offset by
higher revenue in the Securities Services business
segment.
The Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management business
segments generated 60%, 30% and 10% of APAC
revenues, respectively. Net income from APAC was
$542 million in 2024, compared with $547 million in
2023.

operations, including certain key subjective
assumptions used in determining the results, see Note

Country risk exposure
The following table presents BNY’s top 10 exposures
by country (excluding the U.S.) as of Dec. 31, 2024,
as well as certain countries with higher-risk profiles.
The exposure is presented on an internal risk
management basis and has not been reduced by the
allowance for credit losses. We monitor our exposure
to these and other countries as part of our internal
country risk management process.
The country risk exposure below reflects the
Company’s risk to an immediate default of the
counterparty or obligor based on the country of
residence of the entity which incurs the liability. If
there is credit risk mitigation, the country of residence
of the entity providing the risk mitigation is the
country of risk. The country of risk for securities is
generally based on the domicile of the issuer of the
security.

Events in recent years have resulted in increased
focus on Brazil. The country risk exposure to Brazil
is primarily short-term trade finance loans extended
to large financial institutions. We also have
operations in Brazil providing investment services
and investment management services.
The war in Ukraine has increased our focus on
Russia. The country risk exposure to Russia consists
of cash balances related to our securities services
businesses and may increase in the future to the
extent cash is received for the benefit of our clients
that is subject to distribution restrictions. BNY has
ceased new banking business in Russia and
suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. Russian securities included in our
AUC/A and AUM at Dec. 31, 2024, continue to be
insignificant as a percentage of the total AUC/A and
AUM, respectively. We will continue to work with
multinational clients that depend on our custody and
recordkeeping services to manage their exposures.
We are also monitoring our exposure to Israel as part
of our internal country risk management process. At
Dec. 31, 2024, our total exposure to Israel was $158
million and primarily consisted of investment grade
short-term interest-bearing deposits and OTC
derivatives maturing within six months.
Critical accounting estimates
Our significant accounting policies are described in
Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Certain of these policies include critical
accounting estimates which require management to
make subjective or complex judgments about the
effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and
may change in subsequent periods. Our critical
accounting estimates are those related to the
Results of Operations (continued)
22 BNY
allowance for credit losses, goodwill and other
intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Management has discussed the
development and selection of the critical accounting
estimates with the Company’s Audit Committee.
Allowance for credit losses
The allowance for credit losses covers financial assets
subject to credit losses and measured at amortized
cost, including loans and lending-related
commitments, held-to-maturity securities, certain
securities financing transactions and deposits with
banks. The allowance for credit losses is intended to
adjust the carrying value of these assets by an
estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to
incur over the life of the asset. Similarly, the
allowance for credit losses on lending-related
commitments and other off-balance sheet financial
instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that
we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the
balance sheet date.
A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses.
The quantitative component of our estimate uses
models and methodologies that categorize financial
assets based on product type, collateral type, and
other credit trends and risk characteristics, including
relevant information about past events, current
conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts
of future economic conditions that affect the
collectability of the recorded amounts. For the
quantitative component, we segment portfolios into
various major components including commercial
loans and lease financing, commercial real estate,
financial institutions, residential mortgages, and
other. The segmentation of our debt securities
portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by
whether the security is structured or non-structured
(i.e., direct obligation), as well as the issuer type. The
components of the credit loss calculation for each
major portfolio or asset class include a probability of
default, loss given default and exposure at default, as
applicable, and their values depend on the forecast
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment. We utilize a multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting
of three scenarios: a baseline and upside and
downside scenarios and allows us to develop our
estimate using a wide span of economic variables.
Our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely
performance of each global region and the other two
scenarios are designed relative to the baseline
scenario. This approach incorporates a reasonable
and supportable forecast period spanning the life of
the asset, and includes both an initial estimated
economic outlook component as well as a reversion
component for each economic input variable. The
length of each of the two components depends on the
underlying financial instrument, scenario, and
underlying economic input variable. In general, the
initial economic outlook period for each economic
input variable under each scenario ranges between
several months and two years. The speed at which
the scenario-specific forecasts revert to long-term
historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On a quarterly basis, and within
a developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook. The Company uses judgment to assess these
economic conditions and loss data in determining the
best estimate of the allowance for credit losses and
these estimates are subject to periodic refinement
based on changes to underlying external or Companyspecific historical data.
In the quantitative component of our estimate, we
measure expected credit losses using an individual
evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the
asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class
of asset. For these assets, we do not employ the
macroeconomic model calculation but consider
factors such as payment status, collateral value, the
obligor’s financial condition, guarantor support, the
probability of collecting scheduled principal and
interest payments when due, and recovery
expectations if they can be reasonably estimated. For
loans, we measure the expected credit loss as the
difference between the amortized cost basis of the
loan and the present value of the expected future cash
flows from the borrower which is generally
discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, or the
fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateraldependent. We generally individually evaluate
Results of Operations (continued)
BNY 23
nonperforming loans as well as loans that have been
modified given the risk characteristics of such loans.
Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair
value. When an available-for-sale debt security is in
an unrealized loss position, we employ a
methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss
portion of the unrealized loss position. The
measurement of expected credit losses is performed at
the security level and is based on our best single
estimate of cash flows, on a discounted basis;
however, we do not specifically employ the
macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios
summarized above.
The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors that include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We have made and may continue to make
adjustments for idiosyncratic risks.
To the extent actual results differ from forecasts or
management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs
and recoveries.
Our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a
number of inputs, most notably the macroeconomic
forecast assumptions that are incorporated into our
estimate of credit losses through the expected life of
the loan portfolio, as well as credit ratings assigned to
each borrower. As the macroeconomic environment
and related forecasts change, the allowance for credit
losses may change materially. The following
sensitivity analyses do not represent management’s
expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or
the economic environment, but are provided as
hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the
allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs.
If commercial real estate property values were
increased 10% and all other credits were rated one
grade better, the quantitative allowance would have
decreased by $47 million, and if commercial real
estate property values were decreased 10% and all
other credits were rated one grade worse, the
quantitative allowance would have increased by $82
million. Our multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast
used in determining the Dec. 31, 2024 allowance for
credit losses consisted of three scenarios. The
baseline scenario reflects positive but slightly
declining GDP growth through the first quarter of
2025 before moderating, stable unemployment and
slightly declining commercial real estate prices
through the end of 2025. The upside scenario reflects
higher GDP growth through the first quarter of 2025
before moderating, declining unemployment through
the end of 2025 and increasing commercial real estate
prices through the end of 2025 compared with the
baseline. The downside scenario contemplates
negative GDP growth through the third quarter of
2025 before moderating, rapidly increasing
unemployment through the third quarter of 2025 and
sharply lower commercial real estate prices through
the end of 2025 compared with the baseline. At Dec.
31, 2024, we placed the most weight on our baseline
scenario, with the remaining weighting equally placed
on the upside and downside scenarios. From a
sensitivity perspective, at Dec. 31, 2024, if we had
applied 100% weighting to the downside scenario, the
quantitative allowance for credit losses would have
been approximately $130 million higher.
See Notes 1 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding the allowance for credit losses.
Goodwill and other intangibles
We initially record all assets and liabilities acquired
in purchase acquisitions, including goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles, in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations. Goodwill,
indefinite-lived intangibles and other intangibles are
subsequently accounted for in accordance with ASC
350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. The initial
measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires
judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the
acquired assets and liabilities. Goodwill ($16.6
billion at Dec. 31, 2024) and indefinite-lived
intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2024) are
not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment
annually or more often if events or circumstances
indicate it is more likely than not they may be
impaired. Other intangible assets are amortized over
their estimated useful lives and are subject to
impairment if events or circumstances indicate a
possible inability to realize the carrying value.
Results of Operations (continued)
24 BNY
Goodwill
BNY’s business segments include seven reporting
units for which goodwill impairment testing is
performed on an annual basis. An interim goodwill
impairment test is performed when events or
circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more
likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit
may be less than its carrying value.
The goodwill impairment test compares the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying
amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair
value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying
amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered
not impaired. However, if the carrying amount of the
reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value,
an impairment loss would be recorded for the
difference.
In each quarter of 2024, we completed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment
Management reporting unit, which had $6.0 billion of
allocated goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2024. In all cases,
we determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value and no goodwill impairment was recorded.
For the Dec. 31, 2024 test, the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 11%. We
determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit using an income approach
based on management’s projections as of Dec. 31,
2024. The discount rate applied to these cash flows
was 10.5%.
As of Dec. 31, 2024, if the discount rate applied to
the estimated cash flows was increased or decreased
by 25 basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would decrease or
increase by 4%, respectively. Similarly, if the longterm growth rate was increased or decreased by 10
basis points, the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit would increase or
decrease by approximately 1%, respectively.
In the second quarter of 2024, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining six
reporting units using an income approach to estimate
the fair values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash
flows used in the income approach were based on
management’s projections as of April 1, 2024. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%.
As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no
goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair values
of the Company’s remaining six reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting
units’ carrying value.
Intangible assets
Key judgments in accounting for intangible assets
include determining the useful life and classification
between goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets or other amortizing intangible assets.
Indefinite-lived intangible assets ($2.6 billion at Dec.
31, 2024) are evaluated for impairment at least
annually by comparing their fair values, estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, to their carrying
values. As a result of the annual evaluation, no
impairment was recognized.
Other amortizing intangible assets ($275 million at
Dec. 31, 2024) are evaluated for impairment if events
and circumstances indicate a possible impairment.
Such evaluation of other intangible assets would be
initially based on undiscounted cash flow projections.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit or
indefinite-lived intangible assets is subject to
uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of cash flows
that extend far into the future, and, by their nature, are
difficult to estimate over such an extended time
frame. In the future, changes in the assumptions or
the discount rate could produce a material non-cash
goodwill or intangible asset impairment.
See Notes 1 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information
regarding goodwill, intangible assets and the annual
and interim impairment testing.
Litigation and regulatory contingencies
Significant estimates and judgments are required in
establishing an accrued liability for litigation and
regulatory contingencies. For additional information
on our policy, see “Legal proceedings” in Note 22 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Consolidated balance sheet review
One of our key risk management objectives is to
maintain a balance sheet that remains strong
throughout market cycles to meet the expectations of
our major stakeholders, including our shareholders,
clients, creditors and regulators.
We also seek to undertake overall liquidity risk,
including intraday liquidity risk, that stays within our
risk appetite. The objective of our balance sheet
management strategy is to maintain a balance sheet
that is characterized by strong liquidity and asset
quality, ready access to external funding sources at
competitive rates and a strong capital structure that
supports our risk-taking activities and is adequate to
absorb potential losses. In managing the balance
sheet, appropriate consideration is given to balancing
the competing needs of maintaining sufficient levels
of liquidity and complying with applicable
regulations and supervisory expectations while
optimizing profitability.
At Dec. 31, 2024, total assets were $416 billion,
compared with $410 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
increase in total assets was primarily driven by higher
federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements, securities and loans, partially
offset by lower interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks. Deposits
totaled $290 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with
$284 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily
reflects higher interest-bearing deposits in U.S.
offices, partially offset by lower interest-bearing
deposits in non-U.S. offices. Total interest-bearing
deposit liabilities as a percentage of total interestearning assets were 65% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 66% at
Dec. 31, 2023.
At Dec. 31, 2024, available funds totaled $144 billion
and include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing
deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central
banks, interest-bearing deposits with banks and
federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements. This compares with available
funds of $158 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Total
available funds as a percentage of total assets were
35% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 38% at Dec. 31, 2023. For
additional information on our available funds, see
“Liquidity and dividends.”
Securities were $137 billion, or 33% of total assets, at
Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $126 billion, or 31%
of total assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase
primarily reflects higher non-U.S. government and
agency residential mortgage-backed securities
(“RMBS”), partially offset by lower U.S. Treasury
and U.S. government agency securities. For
additional information on our securities portfolio, see
“Securities” and Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Loans were $72 billion, or 17% of total assets, at Dec.
31, 2024, compared with $67 billion, or 16% of total
assets, at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase was driven by
higher loans in the financial institutions and capital
call financing portfolios and higher margin loans,
partially offset by lower commercial loans. For
additional information on our loan portfolio, see
“Loans” and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Long-term debt totaled $30.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024
and $31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease
primarily reflects maturities, redemptions and a
decrease in the fair value of hedged long-term debt,
partially offset by issuances. For additional
information on long-term debt, see “Liquidity and
dividends” and Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation total
shareholders’ equity totaled $41 billion at Dec. 31,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. For additional information,
see “Capital” and Note 15 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Securities
In the discussion of our securities portfolio, we have
included certain credit ratings information because
the information can indicate the degree of credit risk
to which we are exposed. Significant changes in
ratings classifications could indicate increased credit
risk for us and could be accompanied by an increase
in the allowance for credit losses and/or a reduction in
the fair value of our securities portfolio.

related to held-to-maturity securities. The after-tax unrealized losses, net of hedges, related to available-for-sale securities was $1,207 million and the
after-tax equivalent related to held-to-maturity securities was $3,490 million.
The fair value of our securities portfolio was $132.1
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $121.5
billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily
reflects higher non-U.S. government securities and
agency RMBS, partially offset by lower U.S.
Treasury and U.S. government agencies securities.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the securities portfolio had a net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, of $6.2 billion, compared with $7.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, primarily reflects securities moving closer to
maturity.
The fair value of the available-for-sale securities
totaled $88.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 or 67% of the
securities portfolio. The fair value of the held-tomaturity securities totaled $44.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2024, or 33% of the securities portfolio.
The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-forsale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.2
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $1.6 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net
unrealized loss, including the impact of hedges, was
primarily driven by securities moving closer to
maturity.
At Dec. 31, 2024, 99% of the securities in our
portfolio were rated AAA/AA-, unchanged compared
with Dec. 31, 2023.

renewable energy projects to receive an expected
after-tax return, which consists of allocated renewable
energy tax credits, tax deductions and cash
distributions based on the operations of the project.

Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting higher exposure in
the financial institutions and capital call financing
portfolios and higher margin loans.
Our financial institutions and commercial portfolios
comprise our largest concentrated risk. These
portfolios comprised 49% of our total exposure at
Dec. 31, 2024 and 46% at Dec. 31, 2023.
Additionally, most of our overdrafts relate to

The financial institutions portfolio exposure was
$48.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, an increase of 22%
compared with Dec. 31, 2023, primarily reflecting
higher exposure in the securities industry and banks
portfolios.
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with
96% of the exposures meeting the investment grade
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Dec. 31, 2024. Each customer is
assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to
an equivalent external rating agency grade based
upon a number of dimensions, which are continually
evaluated and may change over time. For ratings of
non-U.S. counterparties, our internal credit rating is
generally capped at a rating equivalent to the
sovereign rating of the country where the
counterparty resides, regardless of the internal credit
rating assigned to the counterparty or the underlying
collateral.
The exposure to financial institutions is generally
short-term, with 84% of the exposures expiring
within one year. At Dec. 31, 2024, 18% of the
exposure to financial institutions had an expiration
within 90 days, compared with 19% at Dec. 31, 2023.
Results of Operations (continued)
BNY 29
In addition, 67% of the financial institutions exposure
is secured at Dec. 31, 2024. For example, securities
industry clients and asset managers often borrow
against marketable securities held in custody.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the secured intraday credit
provided to dealers in connection with their tri-party
repo activity totaled $13.4 billion and was included in
the securities industry portfolio. Dealers secure the
outstanding intraday credit with high-quality liquid
collateral having a market value in excess of the
amount of the outstanding credit. Secured intraday
credit facilities represent 28% of the exposure in the
financial institutions portfolio and are reviewed and
reapproved annually.
The asset managers portfolio exposure is highquality, with 96% of the exposures meeting our
investment grade equivalent ratings criteria as of Dec.
31, 2024. These exposures are generally short-term
liquidity facilities, with the majority to regulated
mutual funds.
Our banks portfolio exposure primarily relates to our
global trade finance. These exposures are short-term
in nature, with 95% due in less than one year. The
investment grade percentage of our banks exposure
was 85% at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with 84% at
Dec. 31, 2023. Our non-investment grade exposures
are primarily trade finance loans in Brazil.

at Dec. 31, 2024, a decrease of 1% from Dec. 31,
2023, primarily driven by lower exposure in the
services and other portfolio, partially offset by higher
exposure in the energy and utilities portfolio.
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade
clients that are active users of our non-credit services.

primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth
individuals, a majority of which are secured by the
customers’ investment management accounts or
custody accounts.
Wealth management mortgages
Our wealth management mortgage exposure was $9.1
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $9.4 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. Wealth management mortgages
primarily consist of loans to high-net-worth
individuals, which are secured by residential
property. Wealth management mortgages are
primarily interest-only, adjustable-rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61% at
origination. Less than 1% of the mortgages were past
due at Dec. 31, 2024.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the wealth management mortgage

facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation
facilities. Our client base consists of experienced
developers and long-term holders of real estate assets.
Loans are approved on the basis of existing or
projected cash flows and supported by appraisals and
knowledge of local market conditions. Development
loans are structured with moderate leverage, and in
many instances, involve some level of recourse to the
developer.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the unsecured portfolio consisted
of real estate investment trusts (“REITs”) and real
estate operating companies, which are both primarily
investment grade.
At Dec. 31, 2024, our commercial real estate portfolio

investment grade, or investment grade equivalent, and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified
assets, primarily real estate and large-ticket
transportation equipment. Assets are both domestic
and foreign-based, with primary concentrations in
Germany and the U.S.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgages portfolio primarily
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and
totaled $1.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion

Allowance for credit losses
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment grade clients who are active users of our non-credit services. Our
primary exposure to the credit risk of a customer consists of funded loans, unfunded contractual commitments to

The provision for credit losses was $70 million in
2024, primarily driven by reserve increases related to
commercial real estate exposure and changes in the
macroeconomic forecast.
The allowance for loan losses and allowance for

management’s estimate of lifetime expected losses in
our credit portfolio. This evaluation process is
subject to numerous estimates and judgments. To the

management’s judgment, the allowance for credit
losses may be greater or less than future charge-offs.
Based on an evaluation of the allowance for credit
losses as discussed in “Critical accounting estimates”
and Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, we have allocated our allowance for
loans and lending-related commitments as presented
below.

loans.
The allocation of the allowance for credit losses is
inherently judgmental, and the entire allowance for
credit losses is available to absorb credit losses
regardless of the nature of the losses.

Deposits
We receive client deposits through the businesses in
the Securities Services, Market and Wealth Services
and Investment and Wealth Management segments
and we rely on those deposits as a low-cost and stable
source of funding.
Total deposits were $289.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2024,
an increase of 2%, compared with $283.7 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher
interest-bearing deposits in U.S. offices, partially
offset by lower interest-bearing deposits in non-U.S.
offices.
Noninterest-bearing deposits were $58.3 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. Interest-bearing
deposits were primarily demand deposits and totaled
$231.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with
$225.4 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The aggregate amount of deposits by foreign
customers in domestic offices was $58.8 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $55.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Deposits in non-U.S. offices totaled $95.6 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $96.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
These deposits were primarily overnight deposits.
Uninsured deposits are the portion of U.S. office
deposits accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance
limit. Uninsured deposits in U.S. office deposit
accounts are generally demand deposits and totaled
$168.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $168.4 billion at
Dec. 31, 2023. Our uninsured U.S. office deposits
accounts reflect the amounts disclosed in our
regulatory reports, adjusted to exclude intercompany
deposit balances.

Short-term borrowings
We fund ourselves primarily through deposits and, to
a lesser extent, other short-term borrowings and longterm debt. Short-term borrowings consist of federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, payables to customers and brokerdealers, commercial paper and other borrowed funds.
Certain short-term borrowings, for example,
securities sold under repurchase agreements, require
the delivery of securities as collateral.
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under
repurchase agreements include repurchase agreement
activity with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation
(“FICC”), where we record interest expense on a
gross basis, but the ending and average balances
reflect the impact of offsetting under enforceable
netting agreements. This activity primarily relates to
government securities collateralized resale and
repurchase agreements executed with clients that are
novated to and settle with the FICC.
Payables to customers and broker-dealers represent
funds awaiting reinvestment and short sale proceeds
payable on demand. Payables to customers and
broker-dealers are driven by customer trading activity
and market volatility.
The Bank of New York Mellon issues commercial
paper that matures within 397 days from the date of
issue and is not redeemable prior to maturity or
subject to voluntary prepayment.
Other borrowed funds primarily include borrowings
from the Federal Home Loan Bank, overdrafts of subcustodian account balances in our Securities Services
businesses, and borrowings under lines of credit by
our Pershing subsidiaries. Overdrafts typically relate
to timing differences for settlements.
Liquidity and dividends
BNY defines liquidity as the ability of the Parent and
its subsidiaries to access funding or convert assets to
cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll over or issue
new debt, especially during periods of market stress,
at a reasonable cost, and in order to meet its shortterm (up to one year) obligations. Funding liquidity
risk is the risk that BNY cannot meet its cash and
collateral obligations at a reasonable cost for both
expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral
needs without adversely affecting daily operations or
our financial condition. Funding liquidity risk can
arise from funding mismatches, market constraints
from the inability to convert assets into cash, the
inability to hold or raise cash, low overnight deposits,
deposit run-off or contingent liquidity events.
Changes in economic conditions or exposure to
credit, market, operational, legal and reputational
risks also can affect BNY’s liquidity risk profile and
are considered in our liquidity risk framework. For
additional information, see “Risk Management –
Liquidity Risk.”
The Parent’s policy is to have access to sufficient
unencumbered cash and cash equivalents at each
quarter-end to cover maturities and other forecasted
debt redemptions, net interest payments and net tax
payments for the following 18-month period, and to
provide sufficient collateral to satisfy transactions
subject to Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
We monitor and control liquidity exposures and
funding needs within and across significant legal
entities, branches, currencies and business lines,
taking into account, among other factors, any
applicable restrictions on the transfer of liquidity
among entities.
BNY also manages potential intraday liquidity risks.
We monitor and manage intraday liquidity against
existing and expected intraday liquid resources (such
as cash balances, remaining intraday credit capacity,
intraday contingency funding and available collateral)
to enable BNY to meet its intraday obligations under
normal and reasonably severe stressed conditions.

We define available funds for internal liquidity management purposes as cash and due from banks, interest-bearing

Total available funds were $144.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2024, compared with $157.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The decrease was primarily due to lower interestbearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and other
central banks and interest-bearing deposits with
banks, partially offset by higher federal funds sold
and securities purchased under resale agreements.
Average non-core sources of funds, such as federal
funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase
agreements, trading liabilities, other borrowed funds
and commercial paper, were $20.4 billion for 2024
and $25.0 billion for 2023. The decrease primarily
reflects lower federal funds purchased and securities
sold under repurchase agreements and lower trading
liabilities partially offset by higher commercial paper.
Average interest-bearing domestic deposits were
$141.3 billion for 2024 and $123.5 billion for 2023.
Average foreign deposits, primarily from our
European-based businesses included in the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services segments,
were $92.9 billion for 2024, compared with $88.8
billion for 2023. The changes primarily reflect client
activity.
Average payables to customers and broker-dealers
were $12.7 billion for 2024 and $14.4 billion for
2023. Payables to customers and broker-dealers are
driven by customer trading activity and market
volatility.
Average long-term debt was $31.8 billion for 2024
and $31.0 billion for 2023.
Average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased to
$49.5 billion for 2024 from $59.2 billion for 2023,
primarily reflecting client activity.
A significant reduction of client activity in our
Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services
business segments would reduce our access to
deposits. See “Asset/liability management” for
additional factors that could impact our deposit
balances.
Sources of liquidity
The Parent’s major sources of liquidity are access to
the debt and equity markets, dividends from its
subsidiaries, and cash on hand and cash otherwise
made available in business-as-usual circumstances to
the Parent through a committed credit facility with
our intermediate holding company (“IHC”).

upgraded to Aa1 from Aa2 for BNY Mellon, N.A.
Moody’s affirmed all other long-term and short-term
ratings and assessments for BNY, The Bank of New
York Mellon and BNY Mellon N.A. The outlooks on
BNY’s issuer and senior unsecured ratings have been
changed to stable from positive following the upgrade
of these ratings.
Long-term debt totaled $30.9 billion at Dec. 31, 2024
and $31.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Maturities and
redemptions of $6.0 billion and a decrease in the fair
value of hedged long-term debt were partially offset
by issuances of $5.8 billion. The Parent has $3.3
billion of long-term debt that will mature in 2025.

issued in 2024.

$1.1 billion and $397 million of CDs were
outstanding, respectively.
The Bank of New York Mellon also issues
commercial paper that matures within 397 days from
the date of issue and is not redeemable prior to
maturity or subject to voluntary prepayment. There
was $301 million of commercial paper outstanding at
Dec. 31, 2024. There was no commercial paper
outstanding at Dec. 31, 2023. The average
commercial paper outstanding was $1.2 billion and
$5 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2024, our U.S. bank
subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of
approximately $82 million, without the need for a
regulatory waiver. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2024, nonbank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.8 billion. Restrictions on our
ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries are
discussed in more detail in “Supervision and
Regulation – Capital Planning and Stress Testing –
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions” and in Note 19 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Pershing LLC has one uncommitted line of credit in
place for liquidity purposes which is guaranteed by
the Parent for $300 million. Average borrowings
under this line were less than $1 million in 2024.
Pershing Limited, an indirect UK-based subsidiary of
BNY, has two separate uncommitted lines of credit
amounting to $247 million in aggregate. Average
borrowings under these lines were less than
$1 million, in aggregate, in 2024.
The double leverage ratio is the ratio of our equity
investment in subsidiaries divided by our
consolidated Parent company equity, which includes
our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. In
short, the double leverage ratio measures the extent to
which equity in subsidiaries is financed by Parent
company debt. As the double leverage ratio
increases, this can reflect greater demands on a
company’s cash flows in order to service interest
payments and debt maturities. BNY’s double
leverage ratio is managed in a range considering the
high level of unencumbered available liquid assets
held in its principal subsidiaries (such as central bank
deposit placements and government securities), the
Company’s cash-generating fee-based business
model, with fee revenue representing 73% of total
revenue in 2024, and the dividend capacity of our
banking subsidiaries. Our double leverage ratio was
119.7% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 120.5% at Dec. 31,
2023, and within the range targeted by management.
Uses of funds
The Parent’s major uses of funds are repurchases of
common stock, payment of dividends, principal and
interest payments on its borrowings, acquisitions and
additional investments in its subsidiaries.
In 2024, we paid $1.5 billion in dividends on our
common and preferred stock. Our common stock
dividend payout ratio was 31% for 2024.
In 2024, we repurchased 48.9 million common shares
at an average price of $62.70 per common share for a
total cost of $3.1 billion.
Liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”)
U.S. regulators have established an LCR that requires
certain banking organizations, including BNY, to
maintain a minimum amount of unencumbered highquality liquid assets (“HQLA”) sufficient to
withstand the net cash outflow under a hypothetical
standardized acute liquidity stress scenario for a 30-
day time horizon.
The following table presents BNY’s consolidated
HQLA at Dec. 31, 2024, and the average HQLA and
average LCR for the fourth quarter of 2024.

Net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”)
The NSFR is a liquidity requirement applicable to
large U.S. banking organizations, including BNY.
The NSFR is expressed as a ratio of the available
stable funding to the required stable funding amount
over a one-year horizon. Our average consolidated
NSFR was 132% for the fourth quarter of 2024 and
third quarter of 2024.
BNY and each of our affected domestic bank
subsidiaries were compliant with the NSFR
requirement of at least 100% throughout the fourth
quarter of 2024.
Statement of cash flows
The following summarizes the activity reflected on
the consolidated statement of cash flows. While this
information may be helpful to highlight certain macro
trends and business strategies, the cash flow analysis
may not be as relevant when analyzing changes in our
net earnings and net assets. We believe that in
addition to the traditional cash flow analysis, the
discussion related to liquidity and dividends and
asset/liability management herein may provide more
useful context in evaluating our liquidity position and
related activity.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $687
million in 2024, compared with $5.9 billion in 2023.
In 2024, net cash provided by operating activities
primarily resulted from earnings, partially offset by
changes in trading assets and liabilities. In 2023, net
cash provided by operating activities primarily
resulted from earnings and changes in accruals and
other, net.
Net cash used for investing activities was $9.5 billion
in 2024, compared with $5.8 billion in 2023. In
2024, net cash used for investing activities primarily
reflects changes in federal funds sold and securities
purchased under resale agreements, a net increase in
the securities portfolio and the net change in loans,
partially offset by changes in interest-bearing deposits
with the Federal Reserve and other central banks. In
2023, net cash used for investing activities primarily
reflects changes in interest-bearing deposits with the
Federal Reserve and other central banks and changes
in federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements, partially offset by a net decrease in
the securities portfolio.
Net cash provided by financing activities was $6.3
billion in 2024, compared with net cash used for
financing activities of $3.5 billion in 2023. In 2024,
net cash provided by financing activities primarily
reflects changes in deposits and issuances of longterm debt, partially offset by repayments of long-term
debt and common stock repurchases. In 2023, net
cash used for financing activities primarily reflects
repayments of long-term debt, changes in payables to
customers and broker-dealers and common stock
repurchases, partially offset by issuances of long-term
debt and changes in deposits.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s total
shareholders’ equity increased to $41.3 billion at Dec.
31, 2024 from $40.8 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. The
increase primarily reflects earnings and an increase in
additional paid-in capital, partially offset by common
stock repurchases and dividend payments.
The unrealized loss (after-tax) on our available-forsale securities portfolio, net of hedges, included in
accumulated other comprehensive income was $1.2
billion at Dec. 31, 2024, compared with $1.6 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. The improvement in the net
unrealized loss, including the impact of related
hedges, primarily reflects securities moving closer to
maturity.
We repurchased 48.9 million common shares at an
average price of $62.70 per common share for a total
of $3.1 billion in 2024.
In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity
under the existing January 2023 authorization.
In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common
stock, from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. We began
paying the increased quarterly cash dividend in the
third quarter of 2024.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the
Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding
company (“FHC”), our U.S. bank subsidiaries and
BNY must, among other things, qualify as “well
capitalized.” As of Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023,
BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well
capitalized.” Failure to satisfy regulatory standards,
including “well capitalized” status or capital
adequacy rules more generally, could result in
limitations on our activities and adversely affect our
financial condition. See the discussion of these
matters in “Supervision and Regulation – Regulated
Entities of BNY and Ancillary Regulatory
Requirements” and “Risk Factors – Capital and
Liquidity Risk – Failure to satisfy regulatory
standards, including “well capitalized” and “well
managed” status or capital adequacy and liquidity
rules more generally, could result in limitations on
our activities and adversely affect our business and
financial condition.”
The U.S. banking agencies’ capital rules are based on
the framework adopted by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), as amended from
time to time. For additional information on these
capital requirements, see “Supervision and
Regulation.”

N/A - Not applicable.
Our CET1 ratio determined under the Standardized
Approach was 11.2% at Dec. 31, 2024 and 11.5% at
Dec. 31, 2023 under the Advanced Approaches. The
decrease was primarily driven by capital returned
through common stock repurchases and dividends
and higher RWAs, partially offset by capital
generated through earnings.
The Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.7% at Dec. 31, 2024,
compared with 6.0% at Dec. 31, 2023. The decrease
was driven by higher average assets, partially offset
by an increase in capital.
Risk-based capital ratios vary depending on the size
of the balance sheet at period end and the levels and
types of investments in assets, and leverage ratios
vary based on the average size of the balance sheet
over the quarter. The balance sheet size fluctuates
from period to period based on levels of customer and
market activity. In general, when servicing clients
are more actively trading securities, deposit balances
and the balance sheet as a whole are higher. In
addition, when markets experience significant
volatility or stress, our balance sheet size may
increase considerably as client deposit levels increase.
Our capital ratios are necessarily subject to, among
other things, anticipated compliance with all
necessary enhancements to model calibration,

Stress capital buffer
In July 2023, the Federal Reserve announced that
BNY’s SCB requirement would remain at 2.5%,
equal to the regulatory floor, for the period from Oct.
1, 2023 through Sept. 30, 2024. The SCB replaced
the static 2.5% capital conservation buffer for
Standardized Approach capital ratios for
Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
(“CCAR”) BHCs. The SCB does not apply to bank
subsidiaries, which remain subject to the static 2.5%
capital conservation buffer. In August 2024, the
Federal Reserve announced that BNY’s SCB
requirement would remain at 2.5%, equal to the
regulatory floor, for the period from Oct. 1, 2024
through Sept. 30, 2025. See “Supervision and
Regulation” for additional information.
The SCB final rule generally eliminates the
requirement for prior approval of common stock
repurchases in excess of the distributions in a firm’s
capital plan, provided that such distributions are
consistent with applicable capital requirements and
buffers, including the SCB.

satisfies certain other conditions. Eligible LTD
consists of the unpaid principal balance of eligible
unsecured debt securities, subject to haircuts for
amounts due to be paid within two years, that satisfy
certain other conditions. Debt issued prior to Dec.
31, 2016 has been permanently grandfathered to the
extent these instruments otherwise would be
ineligible only due to containing impermissible
acceleration rights or being governed by foreign law.

If BNY maintains risk-based ratio or leverage TLAC

In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity
under the existing January 2023 authorization.
Share repurchases may be executed through open
market repurchases, in privately negotiated
transactions or by other means, including through
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share
repurchase and other structured transactions. The
timing and exact amount of any common stock
repurchases will depend on various factors, including
market conditions and the common stock trading
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.
Trading activities and risk management
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating hedging in compliance with
the Volcker Rule. The risk from market-making
activities for customers is managed by our traders and
limited in total exposure through a system of position
limits, value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology and other
market sensitivity measures. VaR is the potential loss
in value due to adverse market movements over a
defined time horizon with a specified confidence
level. The calculation of our VaR used by
management and presented below assumes a one-day
holding period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. VaR
facilitates comparisons across portfolios of different
risk characteristics. VaR also captures the
diversification of aggregated risk at the firm-wide
level.
VaR represents a key risk management measure and
it is important to note the inherent limitations to VaR,
which include:
• VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer
time horizons where moves may be extreme;
• VaR does not take into account the potential
variability of market liquidity; and
• Previous moves in market risk factors may not
produce accurate predictions of all future market
moves.
See Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements for additional information on the VaR
methodology.
The following tables indicate the calculated VaR
amounts for the trading portfolio for the designated
periods using the historical simulation VaR model.

N/M – Because the minimum and maximum may occur on different
days for different risk components, it is not meaningful to
compute a minimum and maximum portfolio diversification
effect.
The interest rate component of VaR represents
instruments whose values are predominantly driven
by interest rate levels. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, U.S. Treasury securities, swaps,
swaptions, forward rate agreements, exchange-traded
futures and options, and other interest rate derivative
products.
The foreign exchange component of VaR represents
instruments whose values predominantly vary with
the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or
interest rates. These instruments include, but are not
limited to, currency balances, spot and forward
transactions, currency options and other currency
derivative products.
The equity component of VaR consists of instruments
that represent an ownership interest in the form of
domestic and foreign common stock or other equitylinked instruments. These instruments include, but
are not limited to, common stock, exchange-traded
funds, preferred stock, listed equity options (puts and
calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps,
equity index futures and other equity derivative
products.
The credit component of VaR represents instruments
whose values are predominantly driven by credit
spread levels, i.e., idiosyncratic default risk. These
instruments include, but are not limited to, single
issuer credit default swaps, and securities with
exposures from corporate and municipal credit
spreads.
The diversification component of VaR is the risk
reduction benefit that occurs when combining
portfolios and offsetting positions, and from the
correlated behavior of risk factor movements.
During 2024, interest rate risk generated 43% of
average gross VaR, foreign exchange risk generated
35% of average gross VaR, equity risk generated 1%
of average gross VaR and credit risk generated 21%
of average gross VaR. During 2024, our daily trading
loss exceeded our calculated VaR amount of the
overall portfolio on only one occasion.

interest income.
Trading assets include debt and equity instruments
and derivative assets, primarily foreign exchange and
interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading assets were $14.0 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $10.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Trading liabilities include debt and equity instruments
and derivative liabilities, primarily foreign exchange
and interest rate contracts, not designated as hedging
instruments. Trading liabilities were $4.9 billion at
Dec. 31, 2024 and $6.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Under our fair value methodology for derivative
contracts, an initial “risk-neutral” valuation is
performed on each position assuming time
discounting based on a AA credit curve. In addition,
we consider credit risk in arriving at the fair value of
our derivatives.
We reflect external credit ratings as well as
observable credit default swap spreads for both
ourselves and our counterparties when measuring the
fair value of our derivative positions. Accordingly,
the valuation of our derivative positions is sensitive to
the current changes in our own credit spreads, as well
as those of our counterparties.

At Dec. 31, 2024, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $3.7
billion included a credit valuation adjustment
(“CVA”) deduction of $11 million. Our OTC
derivative liabilities, including those in hedging
relationships, of $2.9 billion included a debit
valuation adjustment (“DVA”) of $7 million related
to our own credit spread. Net of hedges, the CVA
increased by less than $1 million and the DVA
decreased by less than $1 million in 2024, which
decreased other trading revenue by $1 million in
2024. During 2024, no realized loss was charged off
against CVA reserves.
At Dec. 31, 2023, our OTC derivative assets,
including those in hedging relationships, of $2.3
billion included a CVA deduction of $16 million.
Our OTC derivative liabilities, including those in
hedging relationships, of $3.8 billion included a DVA
of $4 million related to our own credit spread. Net of
hedges, the CVA increased by $1 million and the
DVA increased by $1 million in 2023, which
increased other trading revenue by less than $1

Asset/liability management
Our diversified business activities include processing
securities, accepting deposits, investing in securities,
lending, raising money as needed to fund assets and
other transactions. The market risks from these
activities include interest rate risk and foreign
exchange risk. Our primary market risk is exposure
to movements in U.S. dollar interest rates and certain
foreign currency interest rates. We actively manage
interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation
and discounted cash flow models to identify interest
rate exposures.
An earnings simulation model is the primary tool
used to assess changes in pre-tax net interest income
between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest
rate scenarios. Interest rate sensitivity is quantified
by calculating the change in pre-tax net interest
income between the scenarios over a 12-month
measurement period.
The baseline scenario incorporates the market’s
forward rate expectations and management’s
assumptions regarding client deposit rates, credit
spreads, changes in the prepayment behavior of loans
and securities and the impact of derivative financial
instruments used for interest rate risk management
purposes as of each respective quarter-end. These
assumptions have been developed through a
combination of historical analysis and future expected
pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain. Actual
results may differ materially from projected results
due to timing, magnitude and frequency of interest
rate changes, and changes in market conditions and
management’s strategies, among other factors. Client
deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting
net interest income in the baseline as well as the
hypothetical interest rate scenarios. The earnings
simulation model assumes static deposit levels and
mix, and it also assumes that no management actions
will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate
changes. Typically, the baseline scenario uses the
average deposit balances of the quarter.
In the table below, we use the earnings simulation
model to assess the impact of various hypothetical
interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline
scenario. In each of the scenarios, all currencies’
interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or
lower at the start of the forecast. Long-term interest
rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than
three years and short-term interest rates are defined as
all tenors equal to or less than three months. Interim
term points are interpolated where applicable. The
impact of interest rate shifts may not be linear. The
results of this earnings simulation should therefore
not be extrapolated for more severe interest rate
scenarios than those presented in the table below.

At Dec. 31, 2024, the changes in the impacts of a 100
basis point upward or downward shift in rates on net
interest income compared with Sept. 30, 2024 were
primarily driven by an increase in fixed-rate assets
and floating rate liabilities.
While the net interest income sensitivity scenario
calculations assume static deposit balances to
facilitate consistent period-over-period comparisons,
net interest income is impacted by changes in deposit
balances and interest rate trajectory. Noninterestbearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes
in short-term rates.
To illustrate the net interest income sensitivity to noninterest-bearing deposits, we estimate that a $5 billion
instantaneous reduction/increase in U.S. dollardenominated noninterest-bearing deposits would
reduce/increase the net interest income sensitivity
results in the up 100 basis point rate shock scenario in
the table above by approximately $260 million, and in
the down 100 basis point rate shock scenario by
approximately $160 million. The impact would be
smaller if the reduction/increase was assumed to be a
mixture of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits.
Additionally, during periods of low short-term
interest rates, money market mutual fund fees and
other similar fees are typically waived to protect
investors from negative returns.
For a discussion of factors impacting the growth or
contraction of deposits, see “Risk Factors – Capital
and Liquidity Risk – Our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected if we do not effectively manage our
liquidity.”
We also project future cash flows from our assets and
liabilities over a long-term horizon and then discount
these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks
to prevailing interest rates. This measure reflects the
structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by
discounting all future cash flows. The aggregation of
these discounted cash flows is the economic value of
equity (“EVE”). The following table shows how
EVE would change in response to changes in interest
rates.
Estimated changes in EVE Dec. 31,
2024
Rate change:
Up 200 bps vs. baseline (1.9) %
Up 100 bps vs. baseline —%
Down 100 bps vs. baseline (0.7) %
Down 200 bps vs. baseline (2.4) %
The asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact
of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may
create a situation in which an increase in interest rates
can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory
capital, even though economically there may be no
impact on our economic capital position. For
example, an increase in rates will result in a decline in
the value of our available-for-sale securities portfolio.
In this example, there is no corresponding change on
our fixed liabilities, even though economically these
liabilities are more valuable as rates rise.
These results do not reflect strategies that
management could employ to limit the impact as
interest rate expectations change.
To manage foreign exchange risk, we fund foreign
currency-denominated assets with liability
instruments denominated in the same currency. We
utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability
denominated in the same currency is not available or
desired, and to minimize the earnings impact of
translation gains or losses created by investments in
foreign markets. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts to protect the value of our net investment in
foreign operations. At Dec. 31, 2024, net investments
in foreign operations totaled $14 billion and were
spread across 19 foreign currencies.

BNY 47
Overview
BNY plays a vital role in the global financial markets,
and effective risk management is critical to our
success. BNY operates under the Enterprise Risk
Management Framework (“risk management
framework”) which is the foundation of our risk
management approach. Risk management begins
with a strong risk culture, and we reinforce our
culture through principle-based policies including the
Code of Conduct, which are grounded in our core
values of passion for excellence, integrity, strength in
diversity and courage to lead.
These values are critical to our success. They not
only explain what we stand for and our shared
culture, but also help us to think and act globally.
They serve as a representation of the promises we
have made to our clients, communities, shareholders
and each other.
BNY’s Risk Identification process is a core
component of BNY’s risk framework and is the
foundation for understanding and managing risk. We
utilize a common risk language, our Risk Taxonomy,
to identify risks across our six primary risk
categories: Operational Risk, Market Risk, Credit
Risk, Liquidity Risk, Model Risk and Strategic Risk.
Quarterly, the Company engages in a process
designed to document identification and assessment
of its risks, and to determine the set of risks material
to BNY. Outputs from the Risk Identification process
inform elements of our risk framework such as our
Risk Appetite as well as Enterprise-wide Stress
Testing and Capital Planning.
BNY’s Risk Appetite expresses the level of risk we
are willing to tolerate to meet our strategic objectives
in a manner that balances risk and reward while
considering our risk capacity and maintaining a
balance sheet that remains resilient throughout market
cycles. This guides BNY’s risk-taking activities and
informs key decision-making processes, including the
manner by which we pursue our business strategy and
the methods by which we manage risk. The Risk
Appetite Statement and associated key risk metrics to
monitor our risk profile are updated and approved by
the Risk Committee of the Board at least annually.
BNY conducts Enterprise-wide Stress Testing as part
of its Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process
in accordance with CCAR, and as required by the
enhanced prudential standards issued pursuant to the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). Enterprisewide Stress Testing considers the Company’s lines of
business, products, geographic areas and risk types
incorporating the results from underlying models and
projections for a range of stress scenarios. Additional
details on Capital Planning and Stress Testing are
included in “Supervision and Regulation.”
Three Lines of Defense
BNY’s three lines of defense model is a critical
component of our risk management framework to
clarify roles and responsibilities across the
organization.
BNY’s first line of defense includes senior
management and business and corporate staff,
excluding management and employees in Risk
Management, Compliance and Internal Audit. Senior
management in the first line is responsible for
maintaining and implementing an effective risk
management framework and appropriately managing
risk consistent with its strategy and risk tolerance,
including establishing clear responsibilities and
accountability for the identification, measurement,
management and control of risk.
Risk and Compliance is the independent second line
of defense, reporting to the Chief Risk Officer. The
Chief Risk Officer reports to both the Chief
Executive Officer and the Risk Committee of the
Company’s Board of Directors. Risk and
Compliance is responsible for establishing policies,
expectations and guidance for managing risk at BNY
while also independently monitoring, reviewing and
challenging the first line. To facilitate the
comprehensive global application of consistent
standards for each risk or compliance topic,
independent oversight is provided by Risk and
Compliance across three perspectives – lines of
business; legal entities; and enterprise-wide risk and
compliance disciplines.
Internal Audit is BNY’s third line of defense and
serves as an independent, objective assurance
function that reports directly to the Audit Committee
of the Company’s Board of Directors. It assists the
Company in accomplishing its objectives by bringing
a systematic, disciplined, risk-based approach to
evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the
Company’s risk management, control and governance
processes. The scope of Internal Audit’s work
Risk Management
48 BNY
includes the review and evaluation of the adequacy,
effectiveness and sustainability of risk management
procedures, internal control systems, information
systems and governance processes.
Governance
BNY’s management is responsible for execution of the Company’s risk management framework and the governance
structure that supports it, with oversight provided by BNY’s Board of Directors through two key Board committees:
the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee.
A summary of the governance structure is provided below.

Risk Management (continued)
50 BNY
Risk Types Overview
The understanding, identification, measurement and mitigation of risk are essential elements for the successful
management of BNY. We leverage a comprehensive risk taxonomy to support consistent language for defining and
understanding risks. The primary categories in our risk taxonomy are:
Type of risk Description
Operational The risk of loss and/or regulatory, legal or reputational impact resulting from inadequate or failed internal
processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk includes risks, such as compliance
and financial crimes, technology risks and third party risks.
Market The risk of financial loss or adverse change to the economic condition of BNY resulting from movements
in market risk factors. Market risk factors include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads,
foreign exchanges rates, commodity prices, and equity prices.
Credit Credit risk denotes a broad category of adverse financial outcomes arising from credit events (default,
bankruptcy, ratings migration) associated with obligor/counterparty not meeting (inability/unwilling) its
contractual obligations. Credit risk is present in the majority of our assets, but primarily concentrated in
the loan and securities books, as well as foreign exchange and off-balance sheet exposures such as lending
commitments, letters of credit and securities lending indemnifications.
Liquidity The risk arising from an inability to access funding, convert assets to cash quickly and efficiently, or to roll
over or issue new debt, especially during periods of market stress. Liquidity risk includes the inability to
access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk can arise from cash flow
mismatches, market constraints from the inability to convert assets to cash, the inability to raise cash in the
markets, deposit run-off or contingent liquidity events.
Model The potential loss arising from incorrectly designing/using a model or stress conditions that invalidate the
assumptions of a model.
Strategic The risk arising from the flawed design, decision or implementation of a business strategy, and potential
disruption to business strategy by external factors and/or internal decisions. More specifically, the risks
arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions or lack of
responsiveness to changes in the financial industry and operating environment. Strategic risks may also
arise from the acceptance of new businesses, the introduction or modification of products, strategic finance
and risk management decisions, business process changes, complex transactions, acquisitions/divestitures/
joint ventures and major capital expenditures/investments.
Operational risk
In providing a comprehensive array of products and
services, we are exposed to operational risk.
Operational risk may result from, but is not limited to,
errors related to transaction processing, failure of
internal control systems and meeting compliance
requirements, fraud by employees or persons outside
BNY or business interruption due to system failures
or other events. Operational risk may also include
breaches of our technology and information systems
resulting in unauthorized access to confidential
information or from internal or external threats, such
as cyberattacks. Operational risk also includes
potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise.
In the case of an operational event, we could suffer
financial losses as well as reputational damage.
To address these risks, we maintain comprehensive
policies and procedures and an internal control
framework designed to provide a sound operational
environment. These controls have been designed to
manage operational risk at appropriate levels given
our financial strength, the business environment and
markets in which we operate, and the nature of our
businesses, and considering factors such as
competition and regulation.
The organizational framework for operational risk is
based upon a strong risk culture that incorporates
both governance and risk management activities
comprising:
• Accountability of Businesses – Business
managers are responsible for maintaining an
effective system of internal controls
commensurate with the business risk profiles and
in accordance with BNY policies and procedures.
• Operational Risk Management is the independent
second line function responsible for developing
risk management policies and tools for assessing,
measuring, monitoring and managing operational
risk for BNY. The primary objectives of the
Operational Risk Management Framework are to
promote effective risk management, identify
emerging risks and drive improvement in controls
and to reduce operational risk. The Operational
Risk Management (continued)
BNY 51
Risk Management function includes independent
operational risk oversight of all lines of business
and functions, as well as specialist oversight of
areas such as data risk, fraud risk, and third party
risk.
• Technology risk is a subset of operational risk.
Technology Risk Management is part of the
second line of defense risk function providing
oversight over technology risks in an effort to
improve the likelihood that technology risks are
identified, considered, and managed effectively
against the stated risk appetite of the Company.
Technology Risk Management is responsible for
developing risk management policies and tools in
an effort to identify and manage risks across
cyber, infrastructure, applications, and resiliency
and is responsible for confirming such policies
and tools are well understood by the first line of
defense. Further, Technology Risk Management
oversees the risk reporting process through our
governance and that the risks are managed within
our defined risk appetite and risk management
framework. Technology Risk Management uses
its expertise in engaging in centralized activities
and capabilities, and data-driven methodologies.
Additionally, Technology Risk Management acts
as a catalyst to drive the development of global
technology policies, key controls, and methods to
assess, measure, and monitor information and
technology risk for BNY. The function also
conducts integrated independent assessments on
multiple cyber and digital initiatives within the
Company and works to drive better understanding
and a more accurate assessment of technology
risks.
• Operational resiliency is a strategic priority for
the Company. Foundational to our enterprise
resiliency strategy is the Business Services
Framework, governed by the first line Enterprise
Resiliency Office, with second line oversight
from Resiliency Risk Management. First line
business management is accountable for
maintaining effective resiliency capabilities under
this framework, while Engineering and
Operations are responsible for successful
execution in coordination with the business.
Elements of the resiliency strategy include the
Business Services Framework, management of
technology assets, Incident and Crisis
Management, as well as Disaster Recovery
Testing and Business Continuity capabilities. We
are also focused on the resiliency capabilities of
our third-party service providers. These
processes are intended to position the Company
to continuously deliver services to our clients
through our ability to prevent, respond to and
recover from business disruptions and threats.
• Compliance and financial crimes risk is also a
subset of operational risk with second line
Compliance and Ethics and Financial Crime
Compliance teams. Compliance and financial
crimes risk is defined as the risk of legal or
regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or a
financial institution’s reputational loss as a result
of its failure to comply with laws, regulations,
rules, related self-regulatory organizational
standards, and codes of conduct or organizational
standards of practice. We seek to comply with all
obligations through a comprehensive, integrated
Compliance and Ethics Management Framework.
Market risk
Our business activity tends to minimize outright our
direct exposure to market risk, with such risk
primarily limited to market volatility from trading
activity in support of clients. More significant market
risk is assumed in the form of interest rate and credit
spread risk within the investment portfolio as a means
for asset/liability management and net interest income
generation, and also through the interest rate risk
associated with BNY’s balance sheet position which
is sensitive to adverse movements in interest rates.
The Company has indirect market risk exposure
associated with the change in the value of financial
collateral underlying securities financing and
derivatives positions. The Collateral Margin Review
Committee reviews and approves the standards for
collateral received or paid in respect of collateralized
derivative agreements and securities financing
transactions. The Markets business monitors its
market risk through a variety of metrics including
trading VaR and trading stressed VaR. Finally, the
Risk Quantification Review Group reviews backtesting results for the Company’s VaR model.
Credit risk
We extend direct credit in order to foster client
relationships and as a method by which to generate
interest income from the deposits that result from
business activity. We extend and incur intraday
credit exposure in order to facilitate our various
processing activities.
Risk Management (continued)
52 BNY
To balance the value of our activities with the credit
risk incurred in pursuing them, we set and monitor
internal credit limits for activities that entail credit
risk, most often on the size of the exposure and the
quality of the counterparty. For credit exposures
driven by changing market rates and prices, exposure
measures include an add-on for such potential
changes.
We manage credit risk exposure at a counterparty,
industry, country and portfolio level. Credit risk
exposure at the counterparty level is managed through
our credit approval framework and involves four
approval levels up to and including the Chief Risk
Officer of the Company. The requisite approvals are
based upon the size and relative risk of the aggregate
exposure under consideration. The Credit Risk
Group is responsible for approving the size, terms and
maturity of all credit exposures proposed by the
business, as well as the ongoing monitoring of the
creditworthiness of the counterparty. In addition, it is
responsible for challenging and approving the internal
risk ratings on each exposure.
The calculation of a fundamental credit measure is
based on a projection of a statistically probable credit
loss, used to help determine the appropriate loan loss
reserve and to measure customer profitability. Credit
loss considers three basic components: the estimated
size of the exposure whenever default might occur,
the probability of default before maturity and the
severity of the loss we would incur, commonly called
“loss given default.” Borrowers/counterparties are
assigned ratings by the business and reviewed,
challenged and approved by the Credit Portfolio
Managers on an 18-grade scale, which translate to a
scaled probability of default. Additionally,
transactions are assigned loss given default ratings
(on a 5-grade scale) that reflect the transactions’
structures, including the effects of guarantees,
collateral and relative seniority of position.
The Risk Modeling and Analytics Group is
responsible for the calculation methodologies and the
estimates of the inputs used in those methodologies
for the determination of expected loss. These
methodologies and input estimates are regularly
evaluated for appropriateness and accuracy. As new
techniques and data become available, the Risk
Modeling and Analytics Group incorporates, where
appropriate, those techniques or data.
BNY seeks to limit both on- and off-balance sheet
credit risk through prudent underwriting and the use
of capital only where risk-adjusted returns warrant.
We seek to manage risk and improve our portfolio
diversification through syndications, asset sales,
credit enhancements and active collateralization and
netting agreements. In addition, we have a separate
Credit Risk Review Group, which is an independent
group within Internal Audit, composed of
experienced loan review officers who perform timely
reviews of the loan files and credit ratings assigned to
the loans.
Liquidity risk
Adequate liquidity is vital to BNY’s ability to process
payments as well as settle and clear transactions on
behalf of clients. The Company’s liquidity position
can be affected by multiple factors, including funding
mismatches, market conditions that impact our ability
to convert our investment portfolio to cash, inability
to issue debt or roll over funding, run-off of core
deposits, and contingent liquidity events such as
additional collateral posting requirements.
Additionally, a downgrade in our credit rating cannot
only lead to an outflow of deposits, which are a major
source of our funding, but also increase our margin
requirements on secured transactions and have a
broader adverse impact on our overall brand that may
further impair our ability to refinance maturing
liabilities. Changes in economic conditions or
exposure to other risks can also affect our liquidity.
The Board of Directors approves liquidity risk
tolerance and is responsible for oversight of liquidity
risk management of the Company. ALCO provides
governance for the appropriate execution of Boardapproved strategies, policies and procedures for
managing liquidity. Senior management is
responsible for executing those Board-approved
strategies, policies and procedures for managing
liquidity which ALCO oversees, as well as regularly
reporting the liquidity position of the Company to the
Board of Directors. The BSRC provides governance
over independent risk oversight of liquidity risks, and
oversees the establishment of control frameworks.
BNY actively manages and monitors its cash
position, quality of the investment portfolio, intraday
liquidity positions and potential liquidity needs in
order to support the timely payment and settlement of
obligations under both normal and stressed
conditions. The Company uses a range of stress
testing measures in connection with its efforts to
Risk Management (continued)
BNY 53
maintain sufficient liquidity relative to risk appetite,
including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Internal
Liquidity Stress Testing.
Model risk
Models support our infrastructure for managing risk.
Among their functions, models help us value
securities, rate the quality of an obligor’s credit,
establish capital needs and monitor liquidity trends.
Model failure might stem from faulty design, misuse,
or environmental conditions that invalidate our
assumptions. When this happens, the Company could
be exposed to losses and other adverse consequences
resulting from operational, market, credit and
liquidity risk, as well as reputational harm. We aim
to maintain a low-risk environment.
BNY’s processes are designed to identify the
conditions under which model risk incidents could
occur and to establish controls that are designed to
minimize or prevent loss in case of such an event.
These processes include enforcement of standards for
developing models, a process to validate new models,
change controls for existing models, and a monitoring
system to assess performance throughout a model’s
life.
When evaluating the degree of model risk, we
consider multiple dimensions, including the quality of
design, the robustness of controls, and indications of
underperformance. Based on these measures, we
create an overall metric that is intended to measure
the health of the Company’s modeling environment
and set thresholds around it. This allows us to
manage model risk, not only at the level of the
individual model, but also in aggregate, across all the
Company’s businesses.
Strategic risk
Our strategy includes, but is not limited to, improving
organic growth across our businesses, delivering
quality solutions and evolving our operating model.
Successful realization of our strategy requires that we
provide expertise, insight and market-leading and
technology-enabled products and services that drive
economies of scale. Additionally, it requires
attracting, developing and retaining highly talented
people capable of executing our strategy, while
safeguarding our financial profile. Failure to achieve
these objectives may negatively impact both our
growth strategy and our ability to service our existing
clients, resulting in potential financial loss or
litigation.
The markets in which we and our clients operate can
evolve quickly. The introduction of new or disruptive
technologies, geopolitical events and economic
slowdowns are examples of factors that can create
market uncertainty. Failure to anticipate or
participate in transformational change within a given
market or appropriately and promptly react to market
conditions or client preferences could result in poor
strategic positioning and potential negative financial
impact. While it is essential that we continue to
innovate and respond to changing markets and client
demand, we strive to do so in a manner that does not
adversely affect our financial position or compromise
our fundamental business strategy.
Other Risk Considerations
In addition to the primary risk categories and subcategories noted above, we consider risks that have
significance and may manifest across multiple
categories of risk. These risk considerations include
data risk, fraud risk, third party risk, environmental,
social and governance risk, reputational risk and
geopolitical and country risk.
Data risk
We are exposed to data management risk when we
fail to consistently manage and control our data assets
through the entire lifecycle, including managing the
production, confidentiality, quality, integrity,
availability, and retention of data information.
Our risk management approach considers data risks
within our business activities. Our Data Management
Framework and supporting policies address
management of data in key areas of data architecture,
data governance, data quality management, data
protection, data usage and ethics.
Emphasis is placed on data quality through data
policies, regular quality assessments, and continuous
improvement programs aimed at enhancing data
integrity. The data architecture must be resilient and
scalable to support the complex and evolving needs
of the business. Efforts are made to strengthen the
control environment in mitigating data management
risks, aiming to achieve a higher data maturity level
which enables the integration of innovative data
solutions.
Risk Management (continued)
54 BNY
We also consider data risks in the execution of our
business objectives and processes, including the
development of new products and services, including
AI applications. We remain committed to increasing
the effectiveness of our data management practices
which are designed to enable us to deliver products
and services to our clients across the investment
lifecycle.
Fraud risk
Fraud risk, the risk associated with an internal or
external party deliberately performing an activity that
relies on deception to achieve financial gain to the
detriment of BNY or its clients or affiliated or related
parties, is an inherent risk as part of our business. As
part fraud prevention, we utilize tools which include
culture and awareness campaigns, risk identification,
risk assessment and risk mitigation which help us
understand key fraud risks and controls and to
educate employees about the expectations of
identifying and reporting fraud attempts in order to
protect assets of BNY and its clients.
Third party risk
Third party risk arises from an adverse impact on the
Company due to reliance on third parties, including
vendors, that provide goods or perform services or
other benefits on our behalf or on behalf of our
clients. As part of our third-party risk management
framework, we identify, evaluate, measure, mitigate,
monitor and re-assess risks in an attempt to reduce the
likelihood of, and negative impacts from, operational
failures throughout the lifecycle of an engagement
with a third party.
Environmental, social and governance
We are exposed to environmental, social and
governance risks factors that may lead to increased
risk levels across one or more enterprise risk
categories and may impact our risk management
frameworks. For example, climate risks include
physical risks from acute and chronic weather-related
effects as well as transition risks from changes such
as fiscal policy, legislation and regulation,
technological development, and investor and
customer preference changes. Social and governance
risks could also impact our risk categories and risk
management frameworks.
These effects may be wide-ranging with potential
financial and operational resilience implications that
could negatively impact the Company’s strategic
objectives and financial performance, reputation,
business operations, ability to service clients and
broad stakeholder relationships. Potential risk
outcomes include, but are not limited to, adverse
publicity, loss of business, financial loss, litigation,
employee impacts, and other operational impacts.
For example, climate-related impacts have been
identified across our credit portfolios, strategic
positioning, operational resiliency, and the pace and
volume of regulatory change, with the potential for
reputational impacts across these areas. Thus, these
risk factors are considered when managing risk within
appetite and limits across the enterprise risk
categories.
Reputational risk
We are exposed to Reputational Risk as a result of
negative stakeholder perception which may result
from any decision, action, or inaction by BNY, any of
our employees, or through other associated parties,
such as clients, strategic partners, and third parties.
Reputational impacts can result in risks to current or
anticipated earnings, capital, liquidity, brand, and
enterprise value, and can stem from any line of
business, corporate function, legal entity, product, or
service.
Geopolitical and country risk
We are exposed to the effects of geopolitical events,
including tensions between nations and/or regions
that may disrupt the stability of international
relations, economies or markets. Geopolitical event
risks include wars, trade or territorial disputes,
sanctions, cybersecurity conflicts, nuclear
advancements, the imposition of tariffs and retaliatory
measures, shifts in alliances and government policy
changes that impact global systems and stakeholders.
These events can affect macroeconomic factors and
financial markets which could result in losses to BNY
or its clients. We are also exposed to the risks
associated with maintaining commercial relationships
within or connected to sovereign jurisdictions which,
among other things, may not possess: an independent
judiciary, a history of political pluralism, robust
protections for private property (including intellectual
property), traditions of free enterprise or the rule of
law, or similar attributes. We monitor geopolitical
events to assess and measure the potential impact on
BNY.
Risk Management (continued)
BNY 55
BNY maintains a broad range of defenses aimed at
remaining abreast of and responding to evolving
cybersecurity threats impacting the Company, its
operations, its clients, its third-party service providers
and the broader financial services sector. During
2024, cybersecurity threats did not have a material
effect on the Company’s business strategy or
operations. However, the financial services sector is
prone to cybersecurity threats, and there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to
successfully protect its information systems against
material cybersecurity incidents in the future. Given
the increasing prevalence and severity of
cybersecurity incidents affecting financial
institutions, other companies and governmental
agencies as well as the evolving and adaptive nature
of cybersecurity threats, cybersecurity risk
management is a priority for the Company that
impacts its allocation of resources, operations and
risk management strategy. For a further discussion of
the various risks related to cybersecurity threats and
the potential impact on the Company’s business
strategy, results of operations or financial condition,
see “Risk Factors – Operational Risk.”
Risk management strategy and procedures
BNY has implemented policies and procedures
designed to detect, prevent and respond to malicious
and accidental disruptions to the delivery of critical
technology services. BNY’s cybersecurity risk
management program is embedded in the Company’s
three lines of defense model.
As part of its first line of defense, the Company
maintains a dedicated Information Security Division
(“ISD”), led by the Chief Information Security
Officer (the “CISO”), that is responsible for the dayto-day management of risks from cybersecurity
threats. ISD’s responsibilities include cybersecurity
threat intelligence, incident response and other
cybersecurity operations aimed at enabling the
Company to identify, assess and manage existing and
emerging cybersecurity threats. ISD monitors for
potential threats and communicates relevant risks to
the CISO and other members of executive
management. Additionally, ISD maintains a
cybersecurity incident response and reporting process
pursuant to which cybersecurity incidents are
classified according to their severity based upon an
assessment of multiple factors. Certain cybersecurity
incidents may activate enterprise-wide resiliency
processes, which include, among other things,
escalation through the management and Board
committee structures described below. In addition,
the Company maintains a preparedness program
designed to reinforce cybersecurity risk management
practices and compliance with the Company’s
policies and procedures. The preparedness program
includes mandatory training for all employees,
contractors and consultants, enhanced training for
those in roles presenting higher risk, calibrated
phishing email simulations, distribution of
information security awareness materials and
cybersecurity event simulation exercises. In addition,
the Company leverages both internal and external
assessments and engages with third-party assessors,
consultants and auditors to evaluate and test its
cybersecurity controls and provide guidance on
potential improvements, including design and
operating effectiveness. The Company has standing
arrangements with third parties to assist the Company
in identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity
threats, including in connection with risk
assessments, penetration testing, legal advice and
other aspects of the Company’s cybersecurity risk
management and incident response processes.
BNY has a defined third-party governance framework
to help manage the risk posed to the Company by the
use of third-party service providers. The Company
evaluates the risk posed by third-party service
engagements based on multiple factors. The
Company has protocols that seek to mitigate
cybersecurity risks associated with third-party service
providers based on the risk level assigned to such
third party, which may include mandatory contractual
obligations or the implementation of additional
controls by the Company and/or the applicable
service provider.
ISD is subject to ongoing review and challenge from
Technology Risk Management, which is a part of the
independent second line of defense risk function.
Technology Risk Management, together with the
broader Risk & Compliance group, is responsible for
and manages the Company’s risk management
framework and establishes guidance for ISD and
management designed to help identify, assess and
manage cybersecurity risk. For more information on
how we monitor and manage our risk management
framework, see “Risk Management – Overview.”
Internal Audit serves as the third line of defense and
provides an independent view on how effectively the
organization as a whole manages cybersecurity risk.
Cybersecurity
56 BNY
For a further discussion of BNY’s three lines of
defense model, see “Risk Management – Three Lines
of Defense.”
Risk management oversight and governance
The Company’s management is responsible for
assessing and managing the Company’s material risks
from cybersecurity threats with oversight provided by
the Parent’s Board of Directors and the Board
committees. The Risk Committee of the Board has
primary responsibility for oversight of the overall
operation of the Company’s risk management
framework, including policies and practices
addressing cybersecurity risk, and is responsible for
the oversight of the second line of defense with
respect to its cybersecurity risk management
responsibilities. The Technology Committee of the
Board and the full Board regularly receive reports and
briefings from management concerning cybersecurity
matters, including any significant changes to the
Company’s cybersecurity program. The Company
also has protocols for escalating cybersecurity threats
and incidents to the Technology Committee of the
Board and the full Board. In addition, the Audit
Committee monitors and oversees the performance of
Internal Audit, including with respect to its
cybersecurity risk management responsibilities.
At the management level, the Technology Oversight
Committee, which is the senior management
committee responsible for the governance and
oversight of the Company’s significant technology
projects and initiatives, reviews reports from
management concerning ISD and is responsible for,
among other things, escalating issues, including
significant cybersecurity threats and incidents, to the
Technology Committee of the Board. The
Technology Oversight Committee is chaired by the
Chief Information Officer (the “CIO”) and its
members include the CISO.
The Technology Risk Committee is the most senior
governance committee primarily focused on
cybersecurity and technology risk issues and is a part
of the second line of defense risk function. It is
responsible for, among other things, overseeing and
reviewing emerging cybersecurity risks, significant
cybersecurity incidents and remediation plans. The
Technology Risk Committee receives reports from
management and has protocols for escalating certain
issues and risks to the SRCC and the Risk Committee
of the Board of Directors. The Technology Risk
Committee is chaired by the interim Chief
Technology Risk Officer. Members include key
leaders from the first line of defense, including the
CISO.
BNY’s CIO, CISO and interim Chief Technology
Risk Officer each have extensive experience in
assessing and managing risks from cybersecurity
threats. The Company’s CISO joined BNY in 2022
and previously served as head of information security
at a Fortune 500 biopharmaceutical company and an
information technology company, as well as the
Global Chief Technology Officer at a large
cybersecurity company. The Company’s CIO joined
BNY in September 2024 from a large multinational
company, where she was responsible for overseeing
information technology and cybersecurity operations.
The Company’s interim Chief Technology Risk
Officer joined BNY in November 2024 and has
previous experience as Global Head of Cyber,
Technology and Information Security Risk
Management at a global systemically important
financial institution and over a decade of experience
serving the U.S. intelligence community in a variety
of cybersecurity-related positions.

BNY 57
Evolving Regulatory Environment
BNY engages in banking, investment advisory and
other financial activities across the globe and is
subject to extensive regulation in the jurisdictions in
which it operates. Global supervisory authorities
generally are charged with ensuring the safety and
soundness of financial institutions, protecting the
interests of customers, including depositors in
banking entities and investors in mutual funds and
other pooled vehicles, safeguarding the integrity of
securities and other financial markets and promoting
systemic resiliency and financial stability in the
relevant country. They are not, however, generally
charged with protecting the interests of our
shareholders or non-depositor creditors. This
discussion outlines the material elements of selected
laws and regulations applicable to us. The impact of
certain other laws and regulations, such as tax law, is
discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report. Changes
in these standards, or in their application, cannot be
predicted, but may have a material effect on our
businesses and results of operations.
The financial services industry has been the subject of
enhanced regulatory oversight in the past 15 years
globally, and this enhanced oversight environment is
likely to continue in the future. Our businesses have
been subject to a significant number of global reform
measures. Moreover, political developments have
resulted and may continue to result in legislative and
regulatory changes to key aspects of laws and
regulations affecting large banking and financial
institutions and in laws or regulations relating to
sustainability matters.
Enhanced Prudential Standards
The Federal Reserve has adopted rules (“SIFI Rules”)
to implement liquidity requirements, capital stress
testing and overall risk management requirements
affecting U.S. systemically important financial
institutions (“SIFIs”). BNY must comply with
enhanced liquidity and overall risk management
standards, which include maintenance of a buffer of
highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs
for 30 days. The liquidity buffer is in addition to the
rules regarding the LCR and NSFR, discussed below,
and is described by the Federal Reserve as being
“complementary” to these liquidity standards.
Capital Planning and Stress Testing
Payment of Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Other
Capital Distributions
The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from
its banks and other subsidiaries. Therefore, the
Parent primarily relies on dividends, interest,
distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries,
including extensions of credit from the IHC, to meet
its obligations, including its obligations with respect
to its securities, and to provide funds for share
repurchases and payment of common and preferred
dividends to its stockholders, to the extent declared
by the Board of Directors. Various federal and state
laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends
that may be paid to the Parent by our U.S. bank
subsidiaries without regulatory consent. If, in the
opinion of the applicable federal regulatory agency, a
depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged
in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound
practice (which, depending on the financial condition
of the bank, could include the payment of dividends),
the regulator may require, after notice and hearing,
that the bank cease and desist from such practice.
The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC,” and together,
the “Agencies”) have indicated that the payment of
dividends would constitute an unsafe and unsound
practice if the payment would reduce a depository
institution’s capital to an inadequate level. Moreover,
under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended
(the “FDI Act”), an insured depository institution
(“IDI”) may not pay any dividends if the institution is
undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividend
would cause the institution to become
undercapitalized. In addition, the Agencies have
issued policy statements which provide that FDICinsured depository institutions and their holding
companies should generally pay dividends only out of
their current operating earnings.
In general, the amount of dividends that may be paid
by our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including to the
Parent, is limited to the lesser of the amounts
calculated under a “recent earnings” test and an
“undivided profits” test. Under the recent earnings
test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all
dividends declared and paid by the entity in any
calendar year exceeds the current year’s net income
combined with the retained net income of the two
preceding years, unless the entity obtains prior
regulatory approval. Under the undivided profits test,
Supervision and Regulation
58 BNY
a dividend may not be paid in excess of the entity’s
“undivided profits” (generally, accumulated net
profits that have not been paid out as dividends or
transferred to surplus). The ability of our U.S. bank
subsidiaries to pay dividends to the Parent may also
be affected by the capital adequacy standards
applicable to those subsidiaries, which include
minimum requirements and buffers.
There are also limitations specific to the IHC’s ability
to make distributions or extend credit to the Parent.
The IHC is not permitted to pay dividends to the
Parent if certain key capital or liquidity indicators are
breached. Additionally, if our projected financial
resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the
Parent becomes imminent, the committed lines of
credit provided by the IHC to the Parent will
automatically terminate, with all outstanding amounts
becoming due.
BNY’s capital distributions are subject to Federal
Reserve oversight. The major component of that
oversight is the Federal Reserve’s CCAR,
implementing its capital plan rule. That rule requires
BNY to submit annually a capital plan to the Federal
Reserve. We are also required to collect and report
certain related data on a quarterly basis to allow the
Federal Reserve to monitor progress against the
annual capital plan.
On March 4, 2020, the Federal Reserve finalized an
SCB rule, which made changes to the capital plan
rule. The SCB rule eliminated the quantitative
grounds for objection to a firm’s CCAR capital plan
and introduced an SCB that became part of quarterly
capital requirements of CCAR firms on Oct. 1, 2020.
The final rule replaced the 2.5% capital conservation
buffer with an SCB requirement for capital ratios
under the U.S. capital rules’ standardized approach
risk-weightings framework (“Standardized
Approach”) that is based on the largest projected
decrease in a firm’s CET1 ratio in the nine-quarter
CCAR supervisory severely adverse scenario plus
four quarters of planned common stock dividends as
percentage of RWAs. The SCB is subject to a 2.5%
floor. Each CCAR firm, including BNY, will be
notified of its SCB by August 31, and the SCB will
become effective on October 1 of the applicable
calendar year. In June 2024, the Federal Reserve
notified BNY that its preliminary SCB requirement
would remain at 2.5%, which equals the regulatory
floor. The SCB requirement was confirmed via an
announcement from the Federal Reserve in August
2024. The SCB rule requires that firms reduce their
planned capital actions if those distributions would
cause the firm to fall below applicable buffer
requirements based on the firm’s own baseline
scenario projections and allows firms to increase
certain planned capital distributions if they are
forecasted to be above capital buffer constraints. The
SCB rule also eliminates the requirement for prior
approval of capital distributions in excess of the
distributions in a firm’s capital plan, provided that
such distributions do not cause a breach of the firm’s
capital ratios, including applicable buffers. In
addition, the SCB rule provides that a firm must
receive prior approval for any dividend, stock
repurchase or other capital distribution, other than a
capital distribution on a newly issued capital
instrument, if a firm is required to resubmit its capital
plan. In December 2024 and February 2025, the
Federal Reserve indicated that it intends to propose
changes to the stress test framework during 2025 and,
for the 2025 stress test, take steps to reduce the
volatility of results and to improve model
transparency. See “MD&A – Results of Operations –
Capital” for information about our share repurchase
program.
To the extent a banking organization’s capital buffer
is less than 100% of its applicable buffer
requirements, its distributions and discretionary
bonus payments are constrained by the amount of the
shortfall and its eligible retained income. Under the
final rule, eligible retained income is defined as the
greater of (i) a banking organization’s net income for
the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any
distributions and associated tax effects not already
reflected in net income, and (ii) the average of a
banking organization’s net income over the preceding
four quarters. The Federal Reserve made
corresponding changes to the definition of “eligible
retained income” in the TLAC buffer requirements.
For more information on TLAC, see “Total LossAbsorbing Capacity” below.
Regulatory Stress-Testing Requirements
In addition to the CCAR stress testing requirements,
Federal Reserve regulations also include
complementary Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests
(“DFAST”). The CCAR and DFAST requirements
substantially overlap, and the Federal Reserve
implements them at the BHC level on a coordinated
basis. Under these DFAST regulations, we are
required to undergo an annual regulatory stress test
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 59
conducted by the Federal Reserve. The BHC is
required to conduct an annual company-run stress
test. In addition, The Bank of New York Mellon is
required to conduct an annual company-run stress test
(although the bank is permitted to combine certain
reporting and disclosure of its stress test results with
the results of BNY). Results from our annual
company-run stress tests are reported to the
appropriate regulators and published.
Capital Requirements – Generally
As a BHC, we are subject to U.S. capital rules,
administered by the Federal Reserve. Our bank
subsidiaries are subject to similar capital
requirements administered by the Federal Reserve in
the case of The Bank of New York Mellon and by the
OCC in the case of our national bank subsidiaries,
BNY Mellon, National Association (“BNY Mellon,
N.A.”) and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, National Association. These requirements
are intended to ensure that banking organizations
have adequate capital given the risk levels of their
assets and off-balance sheet exposures.
Notwithstanding the detailed U.S. capital rules, the
Agencies retain significant discretion to set higher
capital requirements for categories of BHCs or banks
or for an individual BHC or bank as warranted.
U.S. Capital Rules – Minimum Risk-Based Capital
Ratios and Capital Buffers
The U.S. capital rules require banking organizations
subject to the advanced approaches risk-weighting
framework (the “Advanced Approaches”), such as
BNY, to satisfy minimum risk-based capital ratios
using both the Standardized Approach and the
Advanced Approaches. See “MD&A – Results of
Operations – Capital” for details on these
requirements. In addition, for CCAR firms, these
minimum ratios are supplemented by (i) the SCB
(which, for BNY, is 2.5%, as noted), in the case of a
firm’s Standardized Approach capital ratios, and (ii) a
capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, in the case of a
firm’s Advanced Approaches capital ratios. The
capital conservation buffer can only be satisfied with
CET1 capital.
When systemic vulnerabilities are meaningfully
above normal, the SCB and capital conservation
buffer may be expanded up to an additional 2.5%
through the imposition of a countercyclical capital
buffer. For internationally active banks such as BNY,
the countercyclical capital buffer required threshold is
a weighted average of the countercyclical capital
buffers deployed in each of the jurisdictions in which
the bank has private sector credit exposures. The
Federal Reserve, in consultation with the OCC and
FDIC, has affirmed the current countercyclical capital
buffer level for U.S. exposures of 0% and noted that
any future modifications to the buffer would
generally be subject to a 12-month phase-in period.
Any countercyclical capital buffer required threshold
arising from exposures outside the U.S. will also
generally be subject to a 12-month phase-in period.
For G-SIBs like BNY, the U.S. capital rules’ buffers
are also supplemented by a G-SIB risk-based capital
surcharge, which is the higher of the surcharges
calculated under two methods (referred to as “method
1” and “method 2”). Method 1 is based on the BCBS
framework and considers a G-SIB’s size,
interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity,
substitutability and complexity. Method 2 uses
similar inputs but is calibrated to result in
significantly higher surcharges and replaces
substitutability with a measure of reliance on shortterm wholesale funding. The G-SIB surcharge
applicable to BNY for 2024 was 1.5%.
U.S. Capital Rules – Deductions from and
Adjustments to Capital Elements
The U.S. capital rules provide for a number of
deductions from and adjustments to CET1 capital.
These include, for example, providing that unrealized
gains and losses on all available-for-sale debt
securities may not be filtered out for regulatory
capital purposes, and the requirement that deferred
tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and
significant investments in non-consolidated financial
entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any
one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such
categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.
In addition, the Agencies adopted a final rule that
generally requires certain Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, including BNY, to deduct
from Tier 2 capital, subject to certain exceptions,
direct, indirect and synthetic exposures to covered
debt instruments, including TLAC instruments.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)

U.S. Capital Rules – Advanced Approaches RiskBased Capital Rules
Under the U.S. capital rules’ Advanced Approaches
framework, credit risk-weightings are generally based
on risk-sensitive approaches that largely rely on the
use of internal credit models and parameters, whereas
under the Standardized Approach credit riskweightings are generally based on supervisory riskweightings which vary primarily by counterparty type
and asset class. BNY is required to comply with
Advanced Approaches reporting and public
disclosures. For purposes of determining whether we
meet minimum risk-based capital requirements under
the U.S. capital rules, our CET1 ratio, Tier 1 capital
ratio, and total capital ratio is the lower of each ratio
as calculated under the Standardized Approach and
under the Advanced Approaches framework (based
on currently applicable buffers).
U.S. Capital Rules – Standardized Approach
The Standardized Approach calculates risk-weighted
assets in the denominator of capital ratios using a
broad array of risk-weighting categories that are
intended to be risk sensitive. The risk-weights for the
Standardized Approach generally range from 0% to
1,250%. Higher risk-weights under the Standardized
Approach apply to a variety of exposures, including
certain securitization exposures, equity exposures,
claims on securities firms and exposures to
counterparties on OTC derivatives.
Securities finance transactions, including transactions
in which we serve as agent and provide securities
replacement indemnification to a securities lender, are
treated as repo-style transactions under the U.S.
capital rules. The rules do not permit a banking
organization to use a simple VaR approach to
calculate exposure amounts for repo-style
transactions or to use internal models to calculate the
exposure amount for the counterparty credit exposure
for repo-style transactions under the Standardized
Approach (although these methodologies are allowed
in the Advanced Approaches). Under the
Standardized Approach, a banking organization may
use a collateral haircut approach to recognize the
credit risk mitigation benefits of financial collateral
that secures a repo-style transaction, including an
agented securities lending transaction, among other
transactions. To apply the collateral haircut
approach, a banking organization must determine the
exposure amount and the relevant risk weight for the
counterparty and collateral posted.
U.S. Capital Rules – Standardized Approach for
Measuring Counterparty Credit Risk Exposures for
Derivatives
The Agencies jointly issued the Standardized
Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk (“SA-CCR”)
in January 2020 amending the U.S. capital rules to
implement a modified approach for calculating the
exposure amount for derivative contracts. The final
rule also incorporates SA-CCR into the determination
of exposure amount of derivatives for total leverage
exposure under the SLR and the cleared transaction
framework under the U.S. capital rules. SA-CCR was
implemented in the first quarter of 2022.
U.S. Capital Rules – Leverage Ratios
The U.S. capital rules require a minimum 4%
leverage ratio for all banking organizations, as well as
a 3% Basel III-based SLR for Advanced Approaches
banking organizations, including BNY. Unlike the
Tier 1 leverage ratio, the SLR includes certain offbalance sheet exposures in the denominator, including
the potential future credit exposure of derivative
contracts and 10% of the notional amount of
unconditionally cancelable commitments.
The U.S. G-SIBs (including BNY) are subject to an
enhanced SLR, which requires us to maintain an SLR
of greater than 5% (composed of the current
minimum requirement of 3% plus a greater than 2%
buffer) and requires bank subsidiaries of those BHCs
to maintain at least a 6% SLR in order to qualify as
“well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action
regulations discussed below.
The Agencies adopted a final rule to exclude certain
central bank deposits from the total leverage
exposure, the SLR denominator, and related TLAC
and LTD measures of custody banks, including BNY
and The Bank of New York Mellon. Under the final
rule, qualifying central banks include a Federal
Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank or a central
bank of a member country of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”),
provided that an exposure to the OECD member
country receives a 0% risk-weighting and the
sovereign debt of such country is not, and has not
been, in default in the past five years. The central
bank deposit exclusion from the SLR denominator
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 61
equals the average daily balance over the applicable
quarter of all deposits placed with a qualifying central
bank up to an amount equal to the on-balance sheet
deposit liabilities that are linked to fiduciary or
custodial and safekeeping accounts.
BCBS Revisions to Components of Basel III and U.S.
Implementation
In December 2017, the BCBS released revisions to
Basel III intended to reduce variability of RWA and
improve the comparability of banks’ risk-based
capital ratios. In January 2019, the BCBS released
revised minimum capital requirements for market
risk.
On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and
the FDIC proposed for comment substantial revisions
to the capital requirements applicable to large
banking organizations and to banking organizations
with significant trading activity, including BNY, to
implement the international capital standards issued
by the BCBS. Large banking organizations would be
required to calculate risk-based capital ratios under
both a new Expanded Risk-based Approach
(replacing the current Advanced Approaches
framework) and the current Standardized Approach.
The proposal would replace existing models-based
Advanced Approaches for calculating RWA for credit
risk and operational risk with new standardized
approaches that are part of the Expanded Risk-based
Approach. The proposed Expanded Risk-based
Approach also includes a revised approach to market
risk.
The proposal would also indirectly impact several
other regulations, including the requirements for total
loss-absorbing capacity, long-term debt requirements,
and the surcharge for G-SIBs. The Federal Reserve
has indicated that it expects to work with the OCC
and FDIC in 2025 on a revised proposal.
Risk-Based Capital Surcharges for Global
Systemically Important Bank Holding Companies
On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed
amendments to its rule regarding risk-based capital
surcharges for G-SIBs, including BNY, to revise
certain systemic indicators and measures for G-SIB
surcharges. We are assessing the potential impact of
the proposal.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity
The Federal Reserve imposes external TLAC and
related requirements for U.S. G-SIBs, including
BNY, at the top-tier holding company.
U.S. G-SIBs are required to maintain a minimum
eligible external TLAC equal to the greater of (i) 18%
of RWAs plus a buffer (to be met using only CET1)
equal to the sum of 2.5% of RWAs, the G-SIB
surcharge calculated under method 1 and any
applicable countercyclical buffer; and (ii) 7.5% of
their total leverage exposure (the denominator of the
SLR) plus a buffer (to be met using only Tier 1
Capital) equal to 2%.
U.S. G-SIBs are also required to maintain minimum
external eligible LTD equal to the greater of (i) 6% of
RWAs plus the G-SIB surcharge (calculated using the
greater of method 1 and method 2), and (ii) 4.5% of
total leverage exposure. In order to be deemed
eligible LTD, debt instruments must, among other
requirements, be unsecured, not be structured notes,
and have a maturity of at least one year from the date
of issuance. In addition, LTD issued on or after Dec.
31, 2016 must (i) not have acceleration rights, other
than in the event of non-payment or the bankruptcy or
insolvency of the issuer and (ii) be governed by U.S.
law. However, debt issued by a U.S. G-SIB prior to
Dec. 31, 2016 is permanently grandfathered to the
extent these securities would be ineligible only due to
containing impermissible acceleration rights or being
governed by foreign law.
Further, the top-tier holding companies of U.S. GSIBs are not permitted to issue certain guarantees of
subsidiary liabilities, incur liabilities guaranteed by
subsidiaries, issue short-term debt to third parties, or
enter into derivatives and certain other financial
contracts with external counterparties. Certain
liabilities are capped at 5% of the value of the U.S. GSIB’s eligible external TLAC instruments.
On Aug. 29, 2023, the Federal Reserve proposed for
comment amendments to the TLAC rule applicable to
U.S. G-SIBs, including BNY. The proposal would:
(i) require a $400,000 minimum denomination for
newly issued long-term debt of G-SIBs used to satisfy
TLAC and LTD requirements; (ii) allow only 50% of
the amount of eligible long-term debt with a maturity
of one year or more but less than two years to count
towards TLAC requirements; and (iii) exempt certain
agreements from the scope of the TLAC rule’s clean
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
62 BNY
holding company prohibitions with respect to
qualified financial contracts with third parties. We
are evaluating the potential impact of the proposed
rule.
Certain foreign jurisdictions impose internal TLAC
requirements on the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. GSIBs. The European Union’s Capital Requirements
Regulation 2 (“EU CRR2”) requires EU material
subsidiaries of non-EU G-SIBs (including BNY) to
maintain a minimum level of internal loss absorbing
capacity; this requirement will continue under the
EU’s proposed Capital Requirements Regulation 3
(“EU CRR3”). The BNY SA/NV is considered an
EU material subsidiary for purposes of this regulation
and is, therefore, subject to an internal TLAC
requirement.
Prompt Corrective Action Regarding IDI Capital
Requirements
The FDI Act, as amended by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(“FDICIA”), requires the Agencies to take “prompt
corrective action” in respect of IDIs that do not meet
specified capital requirements. FDICIA establishes
five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: “well
capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,”
“undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,”
and “critically undercapitalized.” The FDI Act
imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on
operations, management and capital distributions the
less capital the institution holds. While these
regulations apply only to banks, such as The Bank of
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., the
Federal Reserve is authorized to take appropriate
action against the parent BHC, such as the Parent,
based on the undercapitalized status of any banking
subsidiary. In certain circumstances, the Parent
would be required to guarantee the performance of
the capital restoration plan if one of our banking
subsidiaries were undercapitalized.
The Agencies’ prompt corrective action framework
contains “well capitalized” thresholds for IDIs.
Under these rules, an IDI must have the capital ratios
as detailed in the “Capital” disclosure in order to
satisfy the quantitative ratio requirements to be
deemed “well capitalized.”
Liquidity Standards – Basel III and U.S. Rules
BNY is subject to the U.S. LCR Rule, which is
designed to ensure that BNY and certain domestic
bank subsidiaries maintain an adequate level of
unencumbered HQLA equal to their expected net
cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon under an acute
liquidity stress scenario. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the
Parent and its domestic bank subsidiaries were in
compliance with applicable LCR requirements.
The Agencies have issued a final NSFR rule that
implements a quantitative long-term liquidity
requirement applicable to large and internationally
active banking organizations, including BNY. Under
the final rule, BNY’s NSFR is expressed as a ratio of
its available stable funding to its required stable
funding amount, and BNY is required to maintain an
NSFR of 1.0. As of Dec. 31, 2024, BNY was in
compliance with the NSFR rule.
Separately, as noted above, the SIFI Rules impose
additional liquidity requirements for BHCs with $100
billion or more in total assets, including BNY,
including an independent review of liquidity risk
management; establishment of cash flow projections;
a contingency funding plan and liquidity risk limits;
liquidity stress testing under multiple stress scenarios
and time horizons tailored to the specific products
and profile of the company; and maintenance of a
liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets
sufficient to meet projected net cash outflows over 30
days under a range of stress scenarios.
Volcker Rule
The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act commonly
referred to as the “Volcker Rule” prohibit “banking
entities,” including BNY, from engaging in
proprietary trading and limit our sponsorship of, and
investments in, private equity and hedge funds
(“covered funds”), including our ability to own or
provide seed capital to covered funds. In addition,
the Volcker Rule restricts us from engaging in certain
transactions with covered funds (including, without
limitation, certain U.S. funds for which BNY acts as
both sponsor/manager and custodian). These
restrictions are subject to certain exceptions.
The restrictions concerning proprietary trading
contain limited exceptions for, among other things,
bona fide liquidity risk management and riskmitigating hedging activities, as well as certain
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 63
classes of exempted instruments, including
government securities. Ownership interests in
covered funds are generally limited to 3% of the total
number or value of the outstanding ownership
interests of any individual fund at any time more than
one year after the date of its establishment. The
aggregate value of all such ownership interests in
covered funds is limited to 3% of the banking
organization’s Tier 1 capital, and such interests are
subject to a deduction from its Tier 1 capital. The
2019 amendments to the Volcker Rule (discussed
below) remove the requirements that ownership
interests in third-party covered funds held under the
underwriting and market-making exemptions be
subject to the aggregate limit and capital deduction
but preserve these requirements for ownership
interests in covered funds sponsored or organized by
BNY.
The Volcker Rule regulations also require us to
develop and maintain a compliance program. In
2019, the Agencies, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) and the SEC modified the
regulations implementing the Volcker Rule. The
most impactful aspects of the revisions with respect
to BNY concern the compliance requirements
applicable to institutions with moderate exposure to
trading assets and trading liabilities, which are
institutions with less than $20 billion and more than
$1 billion of trading assets and trading liabilities.
Specifically, among other revisions, such “moderate
trading” banks are no longer required to file an annual
CEO attestation and quantitative metrics.
Furthermore, the comprehensive six-pillar
compliance program associated with the Volcker
Rule no longer applies to “moderate trading” banks;
rather, such banks are permitted to tailor their
compliance programs to the size and nature of their
activities. BNY is treated as a “moderate trading”
bank under the revised Volcker Rule. The final
revisions also clarified and amended certain
definitions, requirements and exemptions.
On June 25, 2020, a second set of amendments to the
Volcker Rule was released, which is principally
focused on the restrictions on banking entities’
investments in, sponsorship of, and other
relationships with covered funds. Generally, the
changes establish new exclusions from the covered
fund definition for certain types of investment
vehicles, modify the eligibility criteria for certain
existing exclusions, and clarify and modify other
provisions with respect to investment in, sponsoring
of and transactions with covered funds.
Derivatives Trading and Margining
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes a
comprehensive regulatory structure on the OTC
derivatives markets in which BNY operates,
including requirements relating to the business
conduct of dealers, trade reporting, margin and
recordkeeping. Title VII also requires persons acting
as swap dealers, including The Bank of New York
Mellon, to register with the CFTC and become
subject to the CFTC’s supervisory, examination and
enforcement powers. Additionally, Title VII requires
persons acting as security-based swap dealers to
register with the SEC. The Bank of New York
Mellon is registered as a security-based swap dealer.
In addition, because BNY is subject to supervision by
the Federal Reserve, we must comply with the U.S.
prudential margin rules for variation and initial
margin with respect to its OTC swap transactions.
Furthermore, various BNY subsidiaries are also
subject to OTC derivatives regulation by local
authorities in Europe and Asia.
Single Counterparty Credit Limits
The Federal Reserve adopted a rule in June 2018
imposing single-counterparty credit limits (“SCCLs”)
on, among other organizations, domestic BHCs,
including BNY, that are G-SIBs. The SCCLs apply
to the credit exposure of a covered firm and all of its
subsidiaries to a single counterparty and all of its
affiliates and connected entities.
The rule established two primary credit exposure
limits: (i) a covered domestic BHC may not have
aggregate net credit exposure to any unaffiliated
counterparty in excess of 25% of its Tier 1 capital;
and (ii) a U.S. G-SIB is further prohibited from
having aggregate net credit exposure in excess of
15% of its Tier 1 capital to any “major
counterparty” (defined as a G-SIB or a non-bank
SIFI). The rule provides a cure period of 90 days (or,
with prior notice from the Federal Reserve, a longer
or shorter period) for breaches of the SCCL rule.
During the cure period, a company may not engage in
additional credit transactions with the particular
counterparty unless the covered company has
obtained a temporary credit exposure limit increase
from the Federal Reserve.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
64 BNY
Recovery and Resolution Planning
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, large domestic
financial institutions, such as BNY, are required to
submit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the
FDIC a plan – referred to as the 165(d) resolution
plan – for their rapid and orderly resolution in the
event of material financial distress or failure. In
addition, certain large IDIs, such as The Bank of New
York Mellon, are required to submit periodically to
the FDIC a separate plan for resolution in the event of
the institution’s failure. The public portions of these
resolution plans are available on the Federal
Reserve’s and FDIC’s websites. BNY also maintains
a comprehensive recovery plan, which describes
actions it could take to seek to avoid failure if faced
with financial stress.
On June 20, 2024, the FDIC issued a final rule
amending its resolution planning rule applicable to
covered IDIs. The amended rule: (i) adjusts the
frequency of resolution plan submissions by IDIs
affiliated with a U.S. G-SIB, including The Bank of
New York Mellon, from a 3-year cycle to a 2-year
cycle; (ii) expands resolution plan content
requirements; (iii) requires IDIs to provide the FDIC
with notice within 45 days of certain “extraordinary
events”; and (iv) revises certain definitions to be
more consistent with similar concepts and approaches
under the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule became
effective on Oct. 1, 2024.
In 2019, the Federal Reserve and FDIC issued a final
rule modifying certain requirements for the 165(d)
resolution plan. The final rule requires U.S. G-SIBs,
such as BNY, to file alternating full and more limited,
targeted resolution plans every two years. The final
rule does not materially modify the components or
informational requirements of full resolution plans.
BNY submitted a full resolution plan dated July 1,
2023. The Federal Reserve and FDIC found no
deficiencies or shortcomings in BNY’s 2023
resolution plan submission.
If the Federal Reserve and FDIC jointly determine
that our 165(d) resolution plan is not credible and we
fail to address the deficiencies in a timely manner, the
FDIC and the Federal Reserve may jointly impose
more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity
requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities
or operations. If we continue to fail to adequately
remedy any deficiencies, we could be required to
divest assets or operations that the regulators
determine necessary to facilitate our orderly
resolution.
The resolution strategy set out in our 165(d)
resolution plan is a single point of entry strategy,
whereby certain key operating subsidiaries would be
provided with sufficient capital and liquidity to
operate in the event of material financial stress or
failure, and only our parent holding company would
file for bankruptcy. In connection with our single
point of entry resolution strategy, we have established
the IHC to facilitate the provision of capital and
liquidity resources to certain key subsidiaries in the
event of material financial distress or failure. In
addition, we have a binding support agreement in
place that requires the IHC to provide that support.
The support agreement required the Parent to transfer
its intercompany loans and most of its cash to the
IHC and requires the Parent to continue to transfer
cash and other liquid financial assets to the IHC on an
ongoing basis.
BNY and the other U.S. G-SIBs are also subject to
heightened supervisory expectations for recovery and
resolution preparedness under Federal Reserve rules
and guidance. The Federal Reserve incorporates
reviews of our capabilities in respect of recovery and
resolution preparedness as part of its ongoing
supervision of BNY.
In the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in the
UK, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, as
amended by the Bank Resolution and Recovery
Directive II (“BRRD”), provides the legal framework
for recovery and resolution planning, including a set
of harmonized powers to resolve or implement
recovery of in-scope institutions, such as EEA and
UK subsidiaries of third country banks. The UK
transposed the BRRD into local legislation and
regulation before the UK exit from the EU on Dec.
31, 2020. Existing EU law that was in force and
applicable in the UK on Dec. 31, 2020, continues to
be effective under the UK regulatory framework as
“retained EU law.”
The BRRD, as implemented in local law, gives
relevant EEA and UK regulators various powers,
including: (i) powers to intervene pre-resolution to
require an institution to take remedial steps to avoid
the need for resolution; (ii) resolution tools and
powers to facilitate the resolution of failing entities,
such as the power to “bail-in” the debt of an
institution (including certain deposit obligations); (iii)
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 65
the power to require a firm to change its structure to
remove impediments to resolvability; and (iv) powers
to require in-scope institutions to prepare recovery
plans. Under the BRRD, resolution authorities (rather
than the institutions themselves) are responsible for
drawing up resolution plans based on information
provided by relevant institutions.
Under applicable rules, in-scope institutions are
required to maintain a minimum requirement for their
own funds (defined as regulatory capital) and eligible
liabilities (“MREL”) that can be written down or
bailed-in to absorb losses. MREL is set on a case-bycase basis for each institution and is applicable to
certain EU and UK domiciled credit institutions and
certain other firms subject to recovery and resolution
planning BNY SA/NV is subject to MREL.
Rules on Resolution Stays for Qualified Financial
Contracts
The Agencies’ regulations require U.S. G-SIBs (and
their subsidiaries and controlled entities) and the U.S.
operations of foreign G-SIBs to amend their covered
qualified financial contracts (“QFCs”), thereby
facilitating the application of U.S. special resolution
regimes as necessary.
The regulations allow these G-SIBs to comply by
amending covered QFCs (with the consent of relevant
counterparties) using the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) 2018 U.S.
Resolution Stay Protocol, ISDA 2015 Universal Stay
Protocol or by executing appropriate bilateral
amendments to the covered QFCs. BNY entities
which have been confirmed to engage in covered
QFC activities have adhered to the Protocol and,
where necessary, have executed bilateral amendments
to cover QFCs.
Insolvency of an Insured Depository Institution or a
Bank Holding Company; Orderly Liquidation
Authority
Under the FDI Act, if the FDIC is appointed as
conservator or receiver for an IDI, such as The Bank
of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., upon its
insolvency or in certain other circumstances, the
FDIC has the power to:
• Transfer any of the depository institution’s assets
and liabilities to a new obligor, including a newly
formed “bridge” bank without the approval of the
depository institution’s creditors;
• Enforce the terms of the depository institution’s
contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to
any provisions triggered by the appointment of
the FDIC in that capacity; or
• Repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to
which the depository institution is a party, the
performance of which is determined by the FDIC
to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or
repudiation of which is determined by the FDIC
to promote the orderly administration of the
depository institution.
In addition, under federal law, the claims of holders
of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for
administrative expenses against an IDI would be
afforded a priority over other general unsecured
claims, including claims of debt holders, in the
“liquidation or other resolution” of such an institution
by any receiver. As a result, regardless of whether
the FDIC repudiates any debt obligations of The
Bank of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., the
debt holders would be treated differently from, and
could receive, if anything, substantially less than, the
depositors of the bank.
The Dodd-Frank Act created a resolution regime
(known as the “orderly liquidation authority”)
applicable to domestic systemically important
financial companies that are not IDIs, including
BHCs, such as the Parent, and their non-bank
affiliates. Under the orderly liquidation authority, the
FDIC may be appointed as receiver for the
systemically important institution, and its failed nonbank subsidiaries, for purposes of liquidating the
entity if, among other conditions, it is determined that
the institution is in default or in danger of default and
the failure poses a risk to the stability of the U.S.
financial system.
In liquidations of failing financial institutions where
the Dodd-Frank orderly liquidation authority applies,
the orderly liquidation authority supplants the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code and sets forth the powers of the
FDIC as receiver and the rights and obligations of
creditors and other parties who have dealt with the
financial institution. The powers of the FDIC as
receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were
based on the powers of the FDIC as receiver for IDIs
under the FDI Act. However, the provisions
governing the rights of creditors under the orderly
liquidation authority were modified in certain
respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of
creditors’ claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
66 BNY
Nonetheless, substantial differences in the rights of
creditors exist between these two regimes, including
the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of
creditor claims in some circumstances, the use of an
administrative claims procedure to determine
creditors’ claims (as opposed to the judicial procedure
utilized in bankruptcy proceedings), and the right of
the FDIC to transfer assets or liabilities of the
institution to a third party or a “bridge” entity.
Depositor Preference in Bank Resolutions
The FDIC applies a priority regime (“depositor
preference”) for the distribution of receivership assets
of a failed bank. Under the depositor preference
regime, when a U.S. bank fails, the claims of a
receiver of an IDI for administrative expenses and
claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities (including
foreign deposits that are payable in the U.S. as well as
in a foreign branch of the depository institution) are
afforded priority over claims of other unsecured
creditors of the institution, including depositors in
non-U.S. branches. As a result, such depositors could
receive, if anything, substantially less than the
depositors in U.S. offices of the depository
institution.
FDIC Deposit Insurance
Our U.S. banking subsidiaries, including The Bank of
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., accept
deposits, and those deposits have the benefit of FDIC
insurance up to the applicable limit. The current limit
for FDIC insurance for deposit accounts is $250,000
per depositor at each insured bank. Under the FDI
Act, insurance of deposits may be terminated by the
FDIC upon a finding that the IDI has engaged in
unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or
unsound condition to continue operations or has
violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order,
condition imposed by the FDIC, or written agreement
between the IDI and the FDIC.
The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) is
funded by assessments on IDIs. The FDIC assesses
DIF premiums based on an IDI’s average
consolidated total assets, less the average tangible
equity of the IDI during the assessment period. For
larger institutions, such as The Bank of New York
Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., assessments are
determined based on CAMELS ratings and forwardlooking financial measures to calculate the
assessment rate, which is subject to adjustments by
the FDIC, and the assessment base.
Under the FDIC’s regulations, a custody bank,
including The Bank of New York Mellon and BNY
Mellon, N.A., may deduct from its assessment base
100% of cash and balances due from depository
institutions, securities, federal funds sold, and
securities purchased under agreement to resell with a
Standardized Approach risk-weight of 0% and may
deduct 50% of such asset types with a Standardized
Approach risk-weight of greater than 0% and up to
and including 20%. This assessment base deduction
may not exceed the average value of deposits that are
classified as transaction accounts and are identified
by the bank as being directly linked to a fiduciary or
custodial and safekeeping account.
Following the bank failures in March 2023, the FDIC
announced that, as required by the FDI Act, any
losses to the DIF to support uninsured depositors
would be recovered by a special assessment
prescribed through regulation. Under the FDI Act,
the FDIC has discretion with respect to the design and
timeframe for any special assessment, which may be
on IDIs, depository institution holding companies
(with the concurrence of the Treasury Secretary), or
both, as the FDIC determines to be appropriate. The
FDIC may consider the types of entities that benefit
from the action taken, economic conditions, the
effects on the industry, and such other factors as the
FDIC deems appropriate.
On Nov. 16, 2023, the FDIC adopted a final rule,
effective April 1, 2024, implementing a special
assessment on IDIs to recover losses to the DIF
associated with the 2023 closures of Silicon Valley
Bank and Signature Bank. Under the rule, the FDIC
will collect from each IDI a special assessment, based
on the IDI’s estimated uninsured deposits (excluding
the first $5 billion of estimated uninsured deposits
applied at the banking organization level) as of Dec.
31, 2022, during an initial special assessment period
of eight quarters that began in the first quarter of
2024. The special assessment is subject to periodic
adjustment by the FDIC, including early cessation,
extension or a potential one-time final special
assessment for any shortfall to the DIF. We have
recorded accruals and related adjustments for the
estimate of the special assessment to noninterest
expense starting in the fourth quarter of 2023 and
throughout 2024.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 67
BHC as Source of Strength and Liability of
Commonly Controlled Depository Institutions
The Federal Reserve requires BHCs to act as a source
of financial and managerial strength to their bank
subsidiaries. BNY has a statutory obligation to
commit resources to its bank subsidiaries in times of
financial distress. In addition, any loans by BNY to
its bank subsidiaries would be subordinate in right of
payment to depositors and to certain other
indebtedness of its banks. In the event of a BHC’s
reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, any
commitment by the BHC to a federal bank regulator
to maintain the capital of a subsidiary IDI will be
deemed assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and
entitled to priority of payment of the unsecured claim
resulting from such commitment. Further, in certain
circumstances, BNY’s IDI subsidiaries could be held
liable for losses incurred by another BNY IDI
subsidiary. In the event of impairment of the capital
stock of one of BNY’s national bank subsidiaries or
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY, as the banks’
stockholder, could be required to pay such deficiency.
Bank Transactions with Non-bank Affiliates
Transactions between BNY’s banking subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and the Parent and its non-bank
subsidiaries and affiliates, on the other, are subject to
certain restrictions, limitations and requirements,
which include limits on the types and amounts of
transactions (including extensions of credit and asset
purchases by our banking subsidiaries) that may take
place and generally require those transactions to be in
good faith, at arm’s-length, and on market terms. In
general, extensions of credit by a BNY banking
subsidiary to any non-bank affiliate, including the
Parent, must be secured by designated amounts of
specified collateral and are limited in the aggregate to
10% of the relevant bank’s capital and surplus for
transactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the
relevant bank’s capital and surplus for transactions
with all affiliates. There are also limitations on
affiliate credit exposures arising from derivative
transactions and securities lending and borrowing
transactions.
Acquisitions/Transactions by Banks or BHCs
Federal and state laws impose notice and approval
requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving
depository institutions or BHCs. The Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended by the GrammLeach-Bliley Act and by the Dodd-Frank Act (the
“BHC Act”), requires the prior approval of the
Federal Reserve for the direct or indirect acquisition
by a BHC of more than 5% of any class of the voting
shares or all or substantially all of the assets of a
commercial bank, savings and loan association or
BHC. In reviewing bank acquisition and merger
applications, the bank regulatory authorities will
consider, among other things, the competitive effect
of the transaction, financial and managerial resources,
including the capital position of the combined
organization, convenience and needs of the
community factors, including the applicant’s record
under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (the
“CRA”), the effectiveness of the subject
organizations in combating money laundering
activities and the risk to the stability of the U.S.
banking or financial system. In addition, prior
Federal Reserve approval would be required for BNY
to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of
any voting shares of a company with assets of $10
billion or more that is engaged in activities that are
“financial in nature.”
Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) and the USA
PATRIOT Act
A major focus of governmental policy on financial
institutions has been aimed at combating money
laundering and terrorist financing. The USA
PATRIOT Act of 2001 contains numerous AML
requirements for financial institutions that are
applicable to BNY’s bank, broker-dealer and
investment adviser subsidiaries and mutual funds and
private investment companies advised or sponsored
by our subsidiaries. Those regulations impose
obligations on financial institutions to maintain a
broad AML program that includes internal controls,
independent testing, compliance management
personnel, training, and customer due diligence
processes, as well as appropriate policies, procedures
and controls to detect, prevent and report money
laundering, terrorist financing and other suspicious
activity, and to verify the identity of their customers.
Certain of those regulations impose specific due
diligence requirements on financial institutions that
maintain correspondent or private banking
relationships with non-U.S. financial institutions or
persons.
The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”),
which amends the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), was
enacted to comprehensively reform and modernize
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
68 BNY
U.S. AML laws. Among other things, the AMLA
codifies a risk-based approach to AML compliance
for financial institutions; requires the development of
standards by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for
evaluating technology and internal processes for BSA
compliance; and expands enforcement- and
investigation-related authority, including a significant
expansion in the available sanctions for certain BSA
violations and instituting BSA whistleblower
incentives and protections. The AMLA contains
many statutory provisions that require additional
rulemakings, reports and other measures, and the
rulemaking process has begun for several of these
provisions. In June 2021, the first government-wide
priorities for anti-money laundering and countering
the financing of terrorism (“AML/CFT Priorities”)
were published. These AML/CFT Priorities will need
to be incorporated into banks’ risk-based BSA
compliance programs after completion of the
rulemaking process and on the effective date of the
final regulations. The impact of the AMLA will
depend on, among other things, the completion of the
rulemaking process and the issuing of implementation
guidance.
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”)
FinCEN, a bureau of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, issued rules under the BSA that apply to
covered financial institutions, including The Bank of
New York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., setting
forth five pillars of an effective AML program:
development of internal policies, procedures and
related controls; designation of a compliance officer;
a thorough and ongoing training program;
independent review for compliance; and customer
due diligence (“CDD”). CDD requires a covered
financial institution to implement and maintain riskbased procedures for conducting CDD that include
the identification and verification of any beneficial
owner(s) of each legal entity customer at the time a
new account is opened.
Bank Secrecy Act Extended to Investment Advisers
On Aug. 28, 2024, FinCEN adopted a final rule
requiring certain investment advisers to establish antimoney laundering/countering the financing of
terrorism (“AML/CFT”) programs pursuant to the
BSA and to monitor for, and report, suspicious
activity and currency transactions to FinCEN.
Investment advisers will be required to apply their
AML/CFT programs to all advisory services provided
to all customers, except that they will be permitted to
exclude mutual funds, certain bank- and trust
company-sponsored collective investment funds, and
other investment advisers subject to the rule. Among
other requirements, the AML/CFT program must (i)
be risk-based, (ii) be reasonably designed to prevent
the investment adviser from being used for money
laundering, terrorist financing, or other illicit finance
activities and to achieve compliance with applicable
provisions of the BSA and regulations thereunder,
(iii) provide for independent compliance testing, and
(iv) designate responsible persons and ongoing
training. Investment advisers must comply with the
Rule by Jan. 1, 2026. BNY has evaluated the final
rule and is implementing a program designed to meet
the applicable regulatory requirements.
NYSDFS Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorism
Regulations
The New York State Department of Financial
Services (“NYSDFS”) issued regulations requiring
regulated institutions, including The Bank of New
York Mellon, to maintain a transaction monitoring
program to monitor transactions for potential BSA
and AML violations and suspicious activity reporting,
and a watch list filtering program to interdict
transactions prohibited by applicable sanctions
programs.
The regulations require a regulated institution to
maintain programs to monitor and filter transactions
for potential BSA and AML violations and prevent
transactions with sanctioned entities. The regulations
also require institutions to submit annually a board
resolution or senior officer compliance finding
confirming steps taken to ascertain compliance with
the regulation.
Privacy and Data Protection
The privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act generally prohibit financial institutions, including
BNY, from disclosing nonpublic personal financial
information of consumer customers to third parties
for certain purposes (primarily marketing) unless
customers have the opportunity to “opt out” of the
disclosure. The Fair Credit Reporting Act restricts
information sharing among affiliates for marketing
purposes.
In the EU, privacy law is primarily regulated by the
General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 69
GDPR contains enhanced compliance obligations and
penalties for non-compliance.
EU Artificial Intelligence Act
On July 12, 2024, the EU’s Regulation on Artificial
Intelligence (“AI Act”) was published in the Official
Journal of the EU and came into force on Aug. 1,
2024. The AI Act will apply extraterritorially,
impacting both EU and non-EU entities, and will
impact BNY. The AI Act creates a pan-EU
regulatory framework to manage the risks associated
with the use of artificial intelligence, including with
respect to financial services. The AI Act requires
categorization of AI systems into four risk levels
depending on their potential to harm individuals or
society (unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and
minimal risk) and imposes obligations depending on
the risk categorization, which may include data
governance, documentation and recordkeeping,
human oversight, testing, cybersecurity, disclosure,
regulatory notification or reporting, or training. In
addition, the AI Act prohibits AI that pose
unacceptable risks that are abusive or contradict EU
values, including AI that may be manipulative,
exploitive, or discriminatory. The individual
provisions of the AI Act apply on a rolling basis from
Feb. 2, 2025 to Aug. 2, 2027. BNY has evaluated the
impact of the AI Act and has established an
implementation program designed to operationalize
the regulatory requirements applicable to BNY within
required time frames.
SEC Conflicts of Interest Rule for Use of Artificial
Intelligence by Broker-Dealers and Investment
Advisers
On July 26, 2023, the SEC proposed new rules
intended to address certain conflicts of interest
associated with the use of “Covered Technology” by
broker-dealers and investment advisers (“Firms”) in
investor interactions (“Proposed AI Rules”). Covered
Technology is generally described as applying to
“artificial intelligence” or “AI” and is broadly defined
under the Proposed AI Rules to include the use of
analytical, technological, or computational functions,
algorithms, models, correlation matrices, or similar
methods or processes that optimize for, predict,
guide, forecast, or direct investment-related behaviors
or outcomes of an investor. If adopted, the Proposed
AI Rules would: (i) generally apply when a Firm uses
a Covered Technology in engaging or communicating
with an investor, including by exercising discretion
with respect to an investor’s account, providing an
investor with information, or soliciting an investor
and (ii) require Firms to (among other things) identify
conflicts of interests when using Covered Technology
in interactions with investors, and adopt policies and
procedures to eliminate or neutralize those conflicts
of interest. We continue to evaluate the potential
impact of the proposed rules.
Cybersecurity Regulation
The NYSDFS requires financial institutions regulated
by NYSDFS, including The Bank of New York
Mellon, to establish a cybersecurity program, adopt a
written cybersecurity policy, designate a chief
information security officer, address artificial
intelligence risks related to cybersecurity, and have
policies and procedures in place to ensure the security
of information systems and non-public information
accessible to, or held by, third parties. The NYSDFS
rule also includes a variety of other requirements to
protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability
of information systems, including the annual delivery
of a certificate of compliance.
The Agencies have adopted a final rule imposing
notification requirements for significant computersecurity incidents on banking organizations. Under
the final rule, a BHC, state member bank or national
bank, including the Parent, The Bank of New York
Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A., is required to notify
the Federal Reserve or OCC, as applicable, within 36
hours after a computer-security incident that could: (i)
result in the banking organization’s inability to
deliver services to a material portion of its customer
base, (ii) disrupt the banking organization’s lines of
businesses the failure of which would result in
material losses, or (iii) disrupt operations the failure
of which would threaten the financial stability of the
U.S.
On July 26, 2023, the SEC adopted rules, effective on
Sept. 5, 2023, requiring public companies, including
the Parent, to disclose material cybersecurity
incidents and details regarding their cybersecurity
risk management, strategy and governance. Under
the rules, public companies must disclose material
cybersecurity incidents on Form 8-K. Disclosure of
material incidents generally is due within four
business days after a public company determines that
a cybersecurity incident is material. On an annual
basis, public companies must describe in their annual
report on Form 10-K their processes for assessing,
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
70 BNY
identifying, and managing, and management’s role
and expertise in assessing and managing, material
cybersecurity risks; whether any cybersecurity risks
have materially affected or are reasonably likely to
material affect the company; and the board of
directors’ oversight of cybersecurity risks.
On March 15, 2023, the SEC proposed a new rule
regarding cybersecurity risk management for entities
including broker-dealers, security-based swap
dealers, and transfer agents. The proposed rule would
require such entities to maintain written policies and
procedures to address their cybersecurity risk,
immediately notify the SEC of significant
cybersecurity incidents, and publicly disclose
descriptions of their cybersecurity risks and
significant cybersecurity incidents.
In addition, on March 15, 2023, the SEC proposed
amendments to Regulation S-P, including a
requirement for broker-dealers, investment
companies, RIAs, and transfer agents to adopt written
policies and procedures for an incident response
program with respect to unauthorized access to or use
of customer information. The proposal would require
these entities to notify individuals whose sensitive
customer information was accessed or used without
authorization not later than 30 days after becoming
aware that the information was compromised. BNY
is evaluating the potential impact of the proposals.
SEC Amendments to Regulation S-P for Safeguarding
of Customer Information
On May 16, 2024, the SEC adopted amendments (the
“S-P Amendments”) to Regulation S-P, which
governs the safeguarding, treatment and disposal of
customer records and information by certain financial
institutions, to enhance the protection of customer
financial information and establish a federal
minimum standard for data breach notifications to
affected individuals by brokers, dealers, investment
companies, registered investment advisers and
transfer agents (“S-P covered institutions”). The S-P
Amendments: (i) extend certain requirements of
Regulation S-P to transfer agents registered with the
SEC or another appropriate regulatory agency; (ii)
require S-P covered institutions to develop,
implement, and maintain written policies and
procedures for an incident response program that is
reasonably designed to detect, respond to, and recover
from unauthorized access to or use of customer
information; (iii) set forth a data breach notification
requirement that requires S-P covered institutions to
notify affected individuals whose customer
information was, or is reasonably likely to have been,
accessed or used without authorization (subject to
certain exceptions) within 30 days after the S-P
covered institution becomes aware that unauthorized
access to or use of customer information has, or is
reasonably likely to have, occurred; (iv) broaden the
group of customers whose information is protected;
(v) address the use of service providers by S-P
covered institutions; and (vi) codify an existing
statutory exemption to the requirement to provide
annual privacy notices to customers. The S-P
Amendments are effective as of Aug. 2, 2024 and
BNY will have 18 months to come into compliance.
BNY has evaluated the S-P Amendments and is
implementing a program designed to meet the
applicable regulatory requirements.
Sustainability
The SEC adopted a final rule, on March 6, 2024,
requiring registrants, including BNY, to disclose
material climate-related information in registration
statements and periodic reports; however, the final
rule is currently subject to multiple legal challenges
and, on April 4, 2024, the SEC voluntarily issued an
order staying the final rule pending the completion of
judicial review of the legal challenges. In addition,
the SEC’s May 2022 proposed rule and form
amendments under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 remains pending
and would require certain registered investment funds
and certain investment advisers to provide enhanced
disclosures regarding environmental, social, and
governance factors considered. Implementation of
the SEC rules is currently uncertain.
A number of states have proposed or enacted laws
and regulations addressing climate disclosure. For
example, California enacted three statutes imposing
extensive new climate-related disclosure obligations
on certain companies doing business in California,
which became effective on Jan. 1, 2024, including the
Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (as
updated in 2024, “SB 253”), which requires annual
disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions beginning in
2026, and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act (as
updated in 2024, “SB 261”), which requires
publication of biennial reports disclosing climaterelated financial risks and the measures adopted to
mitigate the disclosed risks beginning on Jan. 1,
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 71
2026. Conversely, certain states have enacted or
implemented, or have proposed to enact or
implement, statutes, regulations or policies that
prohibit financial institutions from denying or
canceling products or services to a person, or
otherwise discriminating against a person in making
available products or services, on the basis of social
credit scores and certain other sustainability factors.
In Europe, EU entities in-scope for the Corporate
Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) will
soon be subject to new requirements to disclose
information about impacts, risks, and opportunities
related to sustainability matters. Five EU subsidiaries
of BNY are currently subject to these requirements,
with BNY SA/NV required to report in 2025 and the
remaining four subsidiaries currently scheduled to
report in 2026. However, on Feb. 26, 2025, the
European Commission published proposals aimed at
simplifying the EU sustainability rules (the “Omnibus
Package”). Under the Omnibus Package, only
companies with more than 1,000 employees and
either a turnover above EUR 50 million or a balance
sheet total above EUR 25 million would be obliged to
report under CSRD. In addition, there is a proposal
to postpone the application of all reporting
requirements for companies currently in scope of
CSRD and which are required to report as of 2026
and 2027 until 2028.
The Omnibus Package also puts forward proposals
that would amend the obligations under the current
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive
(“CSDDD”). CSDDD entered into force in the EU
on July 25, 2024, and applies to large EU companies
and non-EU companies with significant EU activity.
Under the current legislative text, CSDDD will apply
on a phased-in basis, starting three years after
CSDDD’s entry into force, dependent on a
company’s number of employees and net worldwide
or EU turnover. In-scope companies are required to
comply with due diligence obligations for their
operations and for their upstream chains of activities
and to adopt a transition plan for climate change
mitigation. The Omnibus Package introduces
proposals aimed at simplifying aspects of CSDDD’s
sustainability due diligence requirements and
postponing the first phase of their application
(covering the largest companies) to July 26, 2028.
If the proposals put forward by the European
Commission under the Omnibus Package are
implemented, this may have a direct impact on the
obligations of the BNY entities currently in scope of
CSRD and CSDDD.
Our UK supervisory authorities have adopted new
disclosure requirements and supervisory expectations
that currently apply or will apply to our subsidiaries
and branches that are regulated by the UK Financial
Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the UK Prudential
Regulation Authority (“PRA”). For example, since
the end of 2021 our PRA regulated branch and
banking subsidiary have been subject to the PRA’s
supervisory expectations for the management of
climate-related financial risks, including as regards
governance, risk management, scenario analysis and
disclosure. Further, new FCA rules on antigreenwashing will require that from May 31, 2024,
any sustainability-related claims made about our
products and services by our FCA regulated entities
are consistent with the sustainability characteristics of
such products or services and are fair, clear and not
misleading.
Published guidance from our regulators globally,
including the Agencies and NYSDFS, has primarily
focused on climate-related financial risk
management, including with respect to, among other
things, governance, policies and procedures, strategy,
risk management, data and reporting, and scenario
analysis. As the global regulatory framework for
climate and sustainability-related disclosure and risk
management practices continues to evolve, including
potential expansion, contraction or streamlining of
regulations, we continue to monitor developments
and evaluate the potential impacts on our business
and operations.
Incentive Compensation Arrangements
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires six
federal regulators to jointly prescribe regulations or
guidelines regarding incentive-based compensation
practices at certain financial institutions, including
BNY. The timeframe for a joint proposal and
implementation of a final rule, if any, is currently
unknown.

BNY is registered as an FHC under the BHC Act and
subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve. In
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
72 BNY
general, the BHC Act limits an FHC’s business
activities to banking, managing or controlling banks,
performing certain servicing activities for
subsidiaries, engaging in activities incidental to
banking, and engaging in any activity, or acquiring
and retaining the shares of any company engaged in
any activity, that is either financial in nature or
complementary to a financial activity and does not
pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of
depository institutions or the financial system
generally.
A BHC’s ability to maintain FHC status is dependent
on: (i) its U.S. IDI subsidiaries qualifying on an
ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well
managed” under the prompt corrective action
regulations of the appropriate regulatory agency
(discussed above under “Prompt Corrective Action”);
(ii) the BHC itself qualifying on an ongoing basis as
“well capitalized” and “well managed” under
applicable Federal Reserve regulations; and (iii) its
U.S. IDI subsidiaries’ continuing to maintain at least
a “satisfactory” rating under the CRA.
The Federal Reserve’s rating system for the
supervision of large financial institutions (“LFIs”)
applies to, among other entities, all BHCs with total
consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, including
BNY. The LFI rating system includes a four-level
rating scale and three component ratings. The four
levels are: Broadly Meets Expectations; Conditionally
Meets Expectations; Deficient-1; and Deficient-2.
The component ratings are assigned for: Capital
Planning and Positions; Liquidity Risk Management
and Positions; and Governance and Controls. A firm
must be rated “Broadly Meets Expectations” or
“Conditionally Meets Expectations” for each of its
component ratings to be considered “well managed”
in accordance with various statutes and regulations
that permit additional activities, prescribe expedited
procedures or provide other benefits for “well
managed” firms. See “U.S. Capital Rules – Leverage
Ratios” and “Prompt Corrective Action Regarding
IDI Capital Requirements” above for details on
qualifying as “well capitalized.”
An FHC that does not continue to meet all the
requirements for FHC status will, depending on
which requirements it fails to meet, lose the ability to
undertake new activities, continue current activities,
or make acquisitions that are not generally
permissible for BHCs without FHC status. As of
Dec. 31, 2024, BNY and our U.S. bank subsidiaries
were “well capitalized” based on the ratios and rules
applicable to them.
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY’s largest
banking subsidiary, is a New York state-chartered
bank, a member of the Federal Reserve and subject to
regulation, supervision and examination by the
Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the NYSDFS. BNY’s
national bank subsidiaries, BNY Mellon, N.A. and
The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company,
National Association, are chartered as national
banking associations subject to primary regulation,
supervision and examination by the OCC.
On Aug. 8, 2023, the Federal Reserve issued a
Supervision and Regulation Letter (SR 23-7)
announcing the establishment of its Novel Activities
Supervision Program (“NASP”) to complement its
existing supervision and oversight of supervised
banking organizations, including BNY. The NASP
encompasses risk-based monitoring and examination
and focuses on, novel activities related to cryptoassets, distributed ledger technology, and complex,
technology-driven partnerships with non-bank
providers of banking products and services to
customers. The Federal Reserve also evaluates, under
the NASP, the concentrated provision of banking
services to crypto-asset-related entities and fintechs.
Securities Markets
We operate a number of broker-dealers that engage in
securities underwriting and other broker-dealer
activities in the U.S. These companies are SECregistered broker-dealers and members of Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), a
securities industry self-regulatory organization.
BNY’s non-bank subsidiaries engaged in securitiesrelated activities are regulated by supervisory
agencies in the countries in which they conduct
business, where required.
Certain of BNY’s public finance and advisory
activities are regulated by the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board and the relevant BNY affiliates
have registered with the SEC, as required under the
SEC’s Municipal Advisors Rule if they provide
advice to municipal entities or certain other persons
on the issuance of municipal securities, or about
certain investment strategies or municipal derivatives.
Certain of BNY’s subsidiaries are registered with the
CFTC as commodity pool operators, introducing
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 73
brokers and/or commodity trading advisors and, as
such, are subject to CFTC regulation. The Bank of
New York Mellon is registered as a swap dealer (as
defined in the Dodd-Frank Act) with the CFTC and is
a member of the National Futures Association
(“NFA”) in that same capacity. As a swap dealer,
The Bank of New York Mellon is subject to
regulation, supervision and examination by the CFTC
and NFA.
On Dec. 13, 2023, the SEC approved a final rule
requiring covered clearing agencies that clear
transactions in U.S. Treasuries (“CCPs”) to establish
policies requiring their direct participants, including
BNY, to submit for clearing all “eligible secondary
market transactions” in U.S. Treasuries to which such
direct participant is a counterparty, which include all
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements
(“repo”) collateralized by U.S. Treasuries and certain
cash transactions in U.S. Treasuries engaging specific
institutions, including inter-dealer brokers, registered
broker-dealers, government securities brokers and
government securities dealers. Eligible secondary
market transactions, however, exclude (i) repo
transactions with affiliates (under certain conditions),
central banks, sovereign entities, international
financial institutions, natural persons and CCPs and
(ii) securities lending transactions involving U.S.
Treasuries. The compliance date for all eligible cash
market transactions is Dec. 31, 2026 and the
compliance date for all eligible repo market
transactions is June 30, 2027.
SEC Rules Impacting Investment and Wealth
Management
SEC regulations impose requirements on mutual
funds, exchange-traded funds and other registered
investment companies (“RICs”) under the 1940 Act.
Among other things, these rules require mutual funds
(other than money market funds) to provide portfoliowide and position-level holdings data to the SEC on a
monthly basis.
The regulations also impose liquidity risk
management requirements that are intended to reduce
the risk that funds will not be able to meet
shareholder redemptions and to minimize the impact
of redemptions on remaining shareholders.
On July 12, 2023, the SEC adopted amendments to
rules that govern money market funds. The
amendments became effective Oct. 2, 2023, with
tiered compliance dates. The amendments include,
among other things: (i) a mandatory liquidity fee for
institutional prime and institutional tax-exempt
money market funds, which will apply when a fund
experiences daily net redemptions that exceed 5% of
net assets (effective Oct. 2, 2023); (ii) maintenance of
a fund board’s ability to impose liquidity fees (not to
exceed 2% of the value of the shares redeemed) on a
discretionary basis for non-government money
market funds (effective April 2, 2024); (iii)
substantially increasing the required minimum levels
of daily and weekly liquid assets for all money
market funds from 10% and 30%, to 25% and 50%,
respectively (effective April 2, 2024); and (iv)
removal of a money market fund’s ability to impose
temporary “gates” to suspend redemptions in order to
prevent dilution and remove the link between a
money market fund’s liquidity level and its
imposition of liquidity fees (effective Oct. 2, 2023).
On Sept. 20, 2023, the SEC adopted amendments
expanding the scope of terms that the SEC considers
materially deceptive and misleading in a fund’s name
without a corresponding policy and related controls to
invest at least 80% of the fund’s net asset value (plus
certain borrowings) in the manner suggested by the
fund’s name (“80% Policy”), including names that
reference “growth” or “value,” or a name indicating
that investment decisions incorporate any
environmental, social and governance factors. The
amendments became effective Dec. 10, 2023 and
fund groups will have either 24 months or 30 months
to come into compliance, depending upon their net
asset size.
On Oct. 26, 2022, the SEC proposed for comment
new rules to prohibit RIAs from outsourcing certain
services and functions without first meeting certain
threshold requirements, including conducting due
diligence, and thereafter requiring ongoing
monitoring of the service providers. The proposal
would apply to RIAs that outsource select “covered
functions,” which include those services or functions
that are necessary for providing advisory services in
compliance with federal securities laws and that, if
not performed or performed negligently, would result
in potential harm to clients. The proposal would
further require RIAs to conduct due diligence and
monitoring for all third-party recordkeepers and
obtain reasonable assurances that the recordkeepers
will meet certain standards. Finally, it would require
RIAs to maintain books and records related to the
new rule’s oversight obligations and to report censusSupervision and Regulation (continued)
74 BNY
type information about the service providers covered
under the rule. We continue to evaluate the impact of
the proposed rule.
On Nov. 2, 2022, the SEC proposed for public
comment rule amendments that would require the
adoption of “swing pricing” and a “hard close” by all
open-end RICs other than money market funds and
exchange-traded funds (“Open-End Funds”). The
requirements would alter the manner in which shares
in Open-End Funds are traded, as shareholders would
no longer receive the NAV per share for their
transactions but instead could receive a price more or
less than the NAV depending on whether a “swing
factor” was applied to their transaction. This swing
factor would be the amount by which the Open-End
Fund adjusts its per-share NAV and would represent
a good-faith estimate of the transaction costs imposed
on current shareholders of the Open-End Fund by the
transacting shareholders. To facilitate the operation
of swing pricing, the SEC also proposed to require a
“hard close” for Open-End Funds, which would make
a purchase or sale order for shares of an Open-End
Fund eligible for a given day’s price only if the OpenEnd Fund or certain designated agents receive the
order before the time when the Open-End Fund
calculates its NAV, which is typically as of 4:00 PM
Eastern Time. We continue to evaluate the impact of
the proposed rule.
SEC Rule 6c-11 (the “ETF Rule”) under the 1940 Act
permits exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) that satisfy
certain conditions to organize and operate without
first obtaining an exemptive order from the SEC and
requires an ETF to make certain disclosures,
including historical data on an ETF’s premiums,
discounts and bid-ask spread information, as well as
the ETF’s daily portfolio holdings. The ETF Rule
also requires ETFs using custom baskets to put
written policies and procedures in place establishing
that the custom baskets are in the best interests of the
ETF and its shareholders. Pursuant to the ETF Rule,
BNY has launched a number of ETFs.
Certain of our subsidiaries are RIAs, and as such are
supervised by the SEC. They are also subject to
various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations
and to the laws and regulations of any countries in
which they conduct business. Our subsidiaries advise
both RICs, including the BNY Mellon Family of
Funds and BNY Mellon ETF Funds, and private
investment companies which are not registered under
the 1940 Act.
Certain of our investment management, trust and
custody operations provide services to employee
benefit plans that are subject to the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), administered by the U.S. Department of
Labor. ERISA imposes certain statutory duties,
liabilities, disclosure obligations and restrictions on
fiduciaries, as applicable, related to the services being
performed and fees being paid.
SEC Regulation Best Interest (“Reg BI”) requires a
broker-dealer to act in the “best interest” of a retail
customer when making a recommendation of any
securities transaction or investment strategy to any
such customer. The Form CRS Relationship
Summary (“Form CRS”) requires RIAs and brokerdealers to provide retail investors with a brief
summary about the nature of their relationship with
their investment professional and supplements other
more detailed disclosures.
On Feb. 15, 2023, the SEC adopted final rule
amendments to shorten the standard settlement cycle
for certain broker-dealer securities transactions to
T+1. The compliance date for the transition to T+1
settlement under the final rule for in-scope
transactions was May 28, 2024.
On Dec. 14, 2022, the SEC proposed four
rulemakings related to market structure, including a
proposed Regulation Best Execution, which would
establish a best execution regulatory framework for
broker-dealers, and proposals regarding order
competition and disclosure of order execution
information. We continue to assess the potential
impacts of the proposals.
On Feb. 15, 2023, the SEC proposed amendments to
the custody rule under the 1940 Act, which generally
requires RIAs deemed to have custody of client funds
or securities to, among other requirements, maintain
client funds or securities with a qualified custodian.
The proposal would expand the types of investments
covered by the custody rule to include any client
“assets.” It would also require RIAs to enter into a
written agreement with, and obtain reasonable
assurances from, the qualified custodian that the
custodian will comply with protections in the
proposed rule, including with respect to
indemnification of the client, responsibility for
subcustodians and central securities depositaries,
asset segregation, and not subjecting client assets to
any liens. In addition, the SEC proposed
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 75
amendments to the investment adviser recordkeeping
rule to require advisers to keep additional, more
detailed records. We continue to evaluate the
potential impact of the proposals.
Operations and Regulations Outside the U.S.
We maintain a presence in the UK through the
London branch of The Bank of New York Mellon,
The Bank of New York Mellon (International)
Limited (a credit institution incorporated and
authorized in the UK), and a number of our
investment firms. We maintain a presence in the EU
through the Frankfurt branch of The Bank of New
York Mellon, BNY SA/NV, which is headquartered
in Belgium and has a branch network in a number of
other EU countries, and through certain of our
investment firms.
BNY SA/NV is a public limited liability company
incorporated under the laws of Belgium, holds a
banking license issued by the National Bank of
Belgium and is authorized to carry out all banking
and savings activities as a credit institution. The
European Central Bank (the “ECB”) has
responsibility for the direct supervision of significant
banks and banking groups in the Euro area, including
BNY SA/NV. The ECB’s supervision is carried out
in conjunction with the relevant national prudential
regulator (the National Bank of Belgium in BNY SA/
NV’s case), as part of the Single Supervisory
Mechanism. BNY SA/NV conducts its activities in
Belgium as well as through its branch offices in
Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. In
Europe, branches of The Bank of New York Mellon
are subject to regulation in the countries in which
they are established, in addition to being subject to
oversight by BNY’s U.S. regulators.
Certain of our financial services operations in the UK
are subject to regulation and supervision by the FCA
and the PRA. The PRA is responsible for the
authorization and prudential regulation of firms that
carry on PRA-regulated activities, including banks.
PRA-authorized firms are also subject to regulation
by the FCA for conduct purposes. In contrast, FCAauthorized firms (such as investment management
firms) have the FCA as their sole regulator for both
prudential and conduct purposes. As a result, FCAauthorized firms must comply with FCA prudential
and conduct rules and the FCA’s Principles for
Businesses, while dual-regulated firms must comply
with the FCA conduct rules and FCA Principles, as
well as the applicable PRA prudential rules and the
PRA’s Principles for Businesses.
The PRA regulates The Bank of New York Mellon
(International) Limited, our UK-incorporated bank, as
well as the London branch of The Bank of New York
Mellon. Certain of BNY’s UK-incorporated
subsidiaries are authorized to conduct investment
business in the UK. Their investment management
advisory activities and their sale and marketing of
retail investment products are regulated by the FCA.
Certain UK investment funds, including investment
funds of BNY, are registered with the FCA and are
offered for sale to retail investors in the UK.
The types of activities in which the foreign branches
of our banking subsidiaries and our international
subsidiaries may engage are subject to various
restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve. Those
foreign branches and international subsidiaries are
also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of
the countries in which they operate and, in the case of
banking subsidiaries, may be subject to regulatory
capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they
operate.
The primary prudential framework in the EU is
provided by the Capital Requirements Directive (“EU
CRD”) and Capital Requirements Regulation (“EU
CRR”), both of which implement many elements of
the Basel III framework. On July 9, 2024, the texts of
the EU Capital Requirements Regulation 3 (“CRR3”)
and Capital Requirements Directive 6 (“CRD6”)
came into effect and will be implemented in phases
through to January 2027. Through these regulations,
the EU will implement the Basel 3.1 standards via
amendments to EU CRD and CRR. These changes
will affect the operations of BNY SA/NV (including
capital and liquidity requirements) and the Frankfurt
branch of The Bank of New York Mellon (including a
capital endowment requirement and additional
governance, reporting and supervisory obligations).
In addition, CRD6 will restrict the provision of
prescribed core banking services by non-EU entities
to EU clients, except where these services are
provided through an authorized EU branch or where
an exemption applies.
The UK’s version of the EU Capital Requirements
Regulation (“UK CRR”) provides the prudential
framework for credit institutions in the UK. Aspects
of UK CRR are currently proposed to be amended as
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
76 BNY
part of the PRA’s plans to implement the Basel 3.1
standards in the UK. The amended rules, which will
be relevant to the operations of The Bank of New
York Mellon (International) Limited, are set to apply
from Jan. 1, 2027.
In the EU, the Investment Firms Directive/Investment
Firms Regulation (“IFD/IFR”) is the EU’s prudential
regime for investment firms. The UK has
implemented its version of the IFD/IFR via the UK
Investment Firms Prudential Regime (“UK IFPR”).
Under both IFD/IFR and UK IFPR, the capital
requirements for most investment firms are based on
factors that are more tailored to the risks that
investment firms face, rather than Basel standards for
banks such as credit risk, market risk or operational
risk. BNY has several EU and UK-domiciled
investment firms that are subject to IFD/IFR and UK
IFPR respectively.
In addition, various proposed changes to regulations
in both the EU and the UK may impact our business.
In the EU, this includes the revised Markets in
Financial Instruments Directive II and Markets in
Financial Instruments Regulation (collectively,
“MiFID II”), the revised Alternative Investment Fund
Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), the Securitisation
Regulations, the revised regulation on OTC
derivatives, central counterparties and trade
repositories (commonly known as “EMIR”), and the
revised Payment Services Directive II (“PSD”).
The UK continues to implement post-Brexit changes
to its financial services’ regulatory framework as part
of an ongoing work program by HM Treasury, the
FCA and the PRA. This program is undertaken
pursuant to a range of initiatives, including the UK
Government’s Edinburgh Reforms (a series of
measures to promote stability and competitive growth
in the UK financial markets post-Brexit), the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2023, the Smarter
Financial Services Regulatory framework (which
continues to progress with the replacement of
assimilated EU law), and the UK's Wholesale
Markets Review.
The lines of business included in our Securities
Services, Market and Wealth Services and Investment
and Wealth Management business segments are
subject to significant regulation in numerous
jurisdictions around the world relating to, among
other things, the safeguarding, administration and
management of client assets and client funds.
BNY continues to assess the impact of the
forthcoming changes outlined above on its operations.
Operational Resilience in Europe
The EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act
(“DORA”) became effective on Jan. 17, 2025 and
harmonizes operational resiliency requirements
across the EU. DORA is broadly aligned with the
BCBS’ Principles for Operational Resilience, with a
focus on reducing risk of failure of information and
communication technology and the risk related to
financial entities’ dependencies on these items.
DORA requires financial entities operating in the EU,
including BNY SA/NV and the Frankfurt branch of
The Bank of New York Mellon to establish an
information and communications technology risk
management framework, including monitoring and
testing, incident response, business continuity, and
third-party risk management. BNY has implemented
a program designed to meet the applicable
requirements.
Banks and branches operating in the UK, including
the London branch of The Bank of New York Mellon
and The Bank of New York Mellon (International)
Limited, are required to finalize implementation of
PRA and FCA requirements on operational resilience
by March 31, 2025. The UK’s operational resilience
regime requires in-scope firms to identify “important
business services” critical to operations, map
necessary resources, processes and information to
deliver the critical services, establish maximum
disruption impact tolerances and related testing,
maintain a communication strategy, and document the
processes in policies and procedures. BNY has
evaluated the final rules and is working towards
implementing applicable requirements.
Funds Regulation in Europe
The AIFMD has a direct effect on our alternative
fund manager clients and our depository business and
other products offered across Europe as well as upon
our Investment Management business. AIFMD
imposes heightened obligations upon depositories,
which have operational effects.
Our businesses servicing regulated funds in Europe
and our Investment Management businesses in
Europe are also affected by the revised directive
governing the Directive on Undertakings for
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
BNY 77
Collective Investment in Transferable Securities
(“UCITS V”).
Under the regulations for depositary safekeeping
duties under AIFMD and UCITS V, the European
Commission recognizes the use of omnibus account
structures when accounting for assets in a chain of
custody, but requires that depositaries and trustees,
such as BNY, maintain their own books and records.
On April 15, 2024, an EU directive amending the
AIFMD entered into force (known as “AIFMD II”).
The revised AIFMD II regime introduces updated
rules for depositaries, a new loan origination
framework, and liquidity management rules for
alternative investment funds (“AIFs”). EU Member
States have until April 2026 to implement the
relevant changes under AIFMD II into their national
laws. BNY is assessing the impact of the changes on
its business.
Supervision and Regulation (continued)
78 BNY
An investment in securities issued by us involves
certain risks that you should carefully consider and
evaluate both at the time of initial purchase and
throughout the holding period of such securities. The
following discussion sets forth the most material risk
factors that could affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. Some of these
risks are interrelated and the occurrence of one may
exacerbate the effect of others. Additionally, factors
other than those discussed below or in our other
reports filed with or furnished to the SEC could also
adversely affect our business, financial condition or
results of operations. We cannot assure you that the
risk factors described below or elsewhere in our
reports address all potential risks that we may face.
These risk factors also serve to describe
considerations which may cause our results to differ
materially from those described in forward-looking
statements included herein or in other documents or
statements that make reference to this Annual Report.
See “Forward-looking Statements.”
Summary
Investing in our securities and in the securities of
banks and financial services companies more broadly
is inherently risky. Our business, financial condition
and results of operations may be materially and
adversely affected by various risk types and
considerations, including operational risk, market
risk, credit risk, capital and liquidity risk, strategic
risk and additional risks, including as a result of the
following:
Operational Risk
• Errors or delays in our operational and
transaction processing, or those of third parties.
• Our risk management framework, policies and
processes not being effective in identifying or
mitigating risk and reducing the potential for
losses and any inadequacy or lapse in our risk
management framework, policies and processes
exposing us to unexpected losses.
• Limitations of the models we use to measure,
monitor and manage risk.
• A communications or technology disruption or
failure within our infrastructure or the
infrastructure of third parties that results in a loss
of information, delays our ability to access
information or impacts our ability to provide
services to our clients.
• A cybersecurity incident, or failure in our
computer systems, networks and information, or
those of third parties, resulting in the theft,
disclosure, use or alteration of information,
unauthorized access to or loss of information, or
system or network failures.
• The development and use of artificial
intelligence.
• Extensive government rulemaking, policies,
regulation and supervision that impact our
operations, and changes to and introduction of
new rules and regulations compelling us to
change how we manage our businesses.
• Regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation.
• Failure to attract, retain, develop and motivate
employees.
• Failure or circumvention of our controls, policies
and procedures.
Market Risk
• Weakness and volatility in financial markets and
the economy generally.
• Dependence on fee-based business and fee-based
revenues, which could be adversely affected by
slowing market activity, weak financial markets,
underperformance and/or negative trends in
savings rates or in investment preferences.
• Levels of and changes in interest rates impacting
our profitability and capital levels.
• Unrealized or realized losses on securities related
to volatile and illiquid market conditions,
reducing our capital levels and/or earnings.
Credit Risk
• Failure or perceived weakness of any of our
significant clients or counterparties, and our
assumption of credit, counterparty and
concentration risk.
• Inadequacy in our allowance for credit losses,
including loan and lending-related commitment
reserves and a deterioration in our expectations of
future economic conditions.
Capital and Liquidity Risk
• Failure to effectively manage our liquidity.
• Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
Risk Factors
BNY 79
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more
generally.
• The Parent’s dependence on dividends from its
subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC
to meet its obligations, including with respect to
its securities, and to provide funds for share
repurchases, payment of income taxes and
payment of dividends to its stockholders.
• Ability to return capital to shareholders, which is
subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors
and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and
regulations, including those governing capital and
capital planning, applicable provisions of
Delaware law and our failure to pay full and
timely dividends on our preferred stock.
• Any material reduction in our credit ratings or the
credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries,
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon,
N.A. or The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV,
which could increase the cost of funding and
borrowing to us and our rated subsidiaries.
• The application of our Title I preferred resolution
strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly
liquidation authority.
Strategic Risk
• New lines of business, new products and services
or transformational or strategic project initiatives,
and the failure to implement these initiatives.
• Our strategic transactions.
• Failure to realize some or all of the expected
benefits of our transition to a platforms operating
model.
• Competition in all aspects of our business.
Additional Risks
• Adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny or
other reputational harm.
• Impacts from geopolitical events, acts of
terrorism, war, natural disasters, the physical
effects of climate change, pandemics and other
similar events.
• Sustainability concerns, including a focus on
climate change and diversity, which could
adversely affect our business, affect client
activity levels, subject us to additional regulatory
requirements and damage our reputation.
• Tax law changes or challenges to our tax
positions with respect to historical transactions.
• Changes in accounting standards governing the
preparation of our financial statements and future
events.
Operational Risk
Errors or delays in our operational and transaction
processing, or those of third parties, may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and reputation.
We are required to accurately process large numbers
of transactions each day on a timely basis. The
transactions we process or execute are operationally
complex and can involve numerous parties,
jurisdictions, regulations and systems, and, therefore,
are subject to execution and processing errors and
failures. In situations reliant upon manual processes,
the risk of execution and processing errors and
failures is heightened. Manual processes are
inherently more prone to human and other processing
error, malfeasance, fraud and other misconduct than
automated processes. With more complex and
voluminous transactions at ever increasing speeds,
which present an increased risk of error or significant
operational delay, we must continuously evolve and
automate our processes, controls, technology, systems
and workforce in a manner designed to achieve
accurate and timely execution of these transactions.
When errors or delays do occur, they may be difficult
to detect and remediate in a timely manner. The use
of automation, artificial intelligence and other
emerging technologies in connection with automated
processes, may amplify the impact of any such error
or delay, as the failure to timely discover and respond
to an operational error can have dramatic
consequences, especially in connection with
automated processes in light of the speed and volume
of transactions involved. These risks are heightened
in connection with the implementation of new
products, systems or processes, which may present
new risks that may not be adequately identified, or for
which we may not have adequate controls.
Furthermore, the risks resulting from an operational
error may be heightened with respect to certain asset
classes, such as some digital assets, with respect to
which it may be impossible to retrieve wrongfully or
erroneously transferred digital assets.
Risk Factors (continued)
80 BNY
Our business, financial, accounting and processing
systems or other operating systems may stop
operating properly, become insufficient or become
disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors
including events that are wholly or partially beyond
our control. We have experienced, and in the future
expect to continue to experience, operational errors
and delays and disruptions to our transaction
processing systems. Such operational errors,
disruptions or significant operational delays could
have a material and negative impact on our ability to
conduct our business or service our clients, which
could adversely affect our results due to potentially
higher expenses and lower revenues, lower our
capital ratios, create liability for us or our clients or
negatively impact our reputation. We also recognize
that service reliability and systems resilience are
essential components to processing transactions and
safeguarding financial assets, and an operational error
impacting a large number of transactions could have
unfavorable ripple effects in the financial markets,
which could exacerbate the adverse effects of the
error on us. There can be no assurance that our
business continuity response plans will effectively
mitigate our operational risks, and any backup
systems or processes may not sufficiently replace our
primary systems.
Affiliates or third parties (including their downstream
service providers) with which we do business or that
facilitate our business activities, including by
providing data, information, technology, security or
infrastructure services, have been, and could in the
future continue to be, sources of execution and
processing errors, breaches or loss, failures or
significant operational delays. These risks may be
amplified to the extent third parties (including their
downstream service providers, such as those that
provide data, cloud computing or other security or
technology services) with which we do business have
adopted the use of automation, artificial intelligence
and other emerging technologies. These risks are
further heightened to the extent that we rely on a
limited, or otherwise concentrated, set of third parties
with respect to certain processes or business
activities.
Our operations must comply with complex and
evolving laws and regulations, including heightened
regulatory and supervisory expectations with respect
to operational and information security systems. In
certain jurisdictions, we may be deemed to be
statutorily or criminally liable for operational errors,
fraud, breakdowns or delays by affiliates or third
parties with which we do business or that facilitate
our business activities. Additionally, as a result of
regulations, including the Alternative Investment
Fund Managers Directive and the Undertakings for
Collective Investment in Transferable Securities V,
when we act as depositary in the European Economic
Area, we could be exposed to restitution risk for,
among other things, errors or fraud perpetrated by a
sub-custodian resulting in a loss or delay in return of
client’s securities. When we are not acting as a
European Economic Area depositary, we may accept
similar liabilities to that of a European Economic
Area depositary as a matter of contract in connection
with our custody services.
Our risk management framework, policies and
processes may not be effective in identifying or
mitigating risk and reducing the potential for losses
and any inadequacy or lapse in our risk
management framework, policies and processes
could expose us to unexpected losses that could
materially adversely affect our results of operations
or financial condition.
Our risk management framework seeks to identify
and mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established
comprehensive policies and procedures and an
internal control framework designed to provide a
sound operational environment for the types of risk to
which we are subject, including operational risk,
credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, model risk and
strategic risk. We have also established frameworks
designed to mitigate risk and loss to us as a result of
the actions of affiliates or third parties with which we
do business (including their common and downstream
service providers) or that facilitate our business
activities. However, as with any risk management
framework, there are inherent limitations to our
current and future risk management strategies,
including risks that we may not have appropriately
anticipated, identified or monitored.
Our regulators remain focused on ensuring that
financial institutions build and maintain robust risk
management policies. Regulators’ views of the
quality of our risk models and framework affect our
regulators’ evaluations of us, and we are exposed to
the risk of adverse regulatory and supervisory
developments, including enforcement actions and
increased costs in connection with remediation
efforts, if our regulators view our risk models and
framework to be insufficient or if remediation is not
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 81
completed in a timely manner. Accurate and timely
enterprise-wide risk information is necessary to
enhance management’s decision-making in times of
crisis. If our risk management framework or
governance structure proves ineffective or if our
enterprise-wide management information is
incomplete or inaccurate, we could suffer unexpected
losses, which could materially adversely affect our
results of operations or financial condition.
In addition, our businesses and the markets in which
we operate are continuously evolving. We may fail
to fully understand the implications of changes in our
businesses, industry or the financial markets or fail to
adequately or timely enhance our risk framework to
address those changes. If our risk framework is
ineffective because it fails to keep pace with changes
in the industry, financial markets, regulatory
requirements, our businesses, our counterparties,
clients or service providers or for other reasons, we
could incur losses, suffer reputational damage, face
significant remediation expenses or find ourselves out
of compliance with applicable regulatory or
contractual mandates or supervisory expectations.
Our control environment and related systems, from
time to time, have in the past not sufficiently
detected, and may in the future not sufficiently detect,
each error, omission or other mistake made by us.
These have in the past included, and may in the future
include, calculation errors, errors in software or
model development or implementation, data or
informational errors or incompleteness, or errors in
judgment. Human errors, malfeasance, failure to
follow applicable policies, laws, rules or procedures
and other misconduct in connection with our risk
management framework, policies and processes, even
if promptly discovered and remediated, have in the
past resulted, and could in the future result, in
inaccurate reporting to regulatory bodies, reputational
damage and losses and liabilities for us.
An important aspect of our risk management
framework is creating a risk culture that is sustainable
and appropriate to our role as a major financial
institution in which our employees understand that
there is risk in every aspect of our business and the
importance of managing risk as it relates to their job
functions. If we fail to create the appropriate
environment that sensitizes our employees to
managing risk, our business could be adversely
impacted. For more information on how we monitor
and manage our risk management framework, see
“Risk Management – Overview.”
Limitations of the models we use to measure,
monitor and manage risk could lead to unexpected
losses and adverse business impacts.
We rely on quantitative and qualitative models,
analytical techniques and judgment-based estimations
to measure, monitor and manage various risks,
including credit, market, liquidity and operational
risks. These models are also used for financial and
other regulatory reporting, capital planning and other
critical functions. While essential for decisionmaking, models are inherently limited and subject to
inaccuracies stemming from flawed assumptions,
design issues or evolving market conditions. Further,
even absent flawed or inadequate model assumptions,
design issues and data inaccuracies, there can be no
assurance that the models we utilize will adequately
mitigate risk or loss to us under all circumstances.
Our models depend on historical data, assumptions
and correlations that may not accurately predict future
conditions, particularly during periods of market
stress or economic uncertainty. For example,
unexpected geopolitical events, rapidly evolving
market conditions or unforeseen economic downturns
may render model assumptions inadequate.
Additionally, models may fail to fully capture
interdependencies among risk factors, leading to
incomplete or misleading outputs.
In certain instances, we rely on models to measure,
monitor and predict risks, including as part of our
overall asset/liability management. However, these
models are inherently limited because they involve
techniques, including the use of historical data and
trends, assumptions, estimates, judgments and
forecasts, which may be incomplete or inaccurate.
These models cannot anticipate every economic and
financial outcome, particularly during severe market
downturns, geopolitical events or other stress events
such as those experienced during the COVID-19
pandemic or in connection with the insolvencies of
Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in 2023.
The models that we use to assess and control our
market risk exposures also reflect assumptions about
the degree of correlation among prices of various
asset classes or other market indicators. The 2008
financial crisis and resulting regulatory reform
highlighted both the importance and some of the
Risk Factors (continued)
82 BNY
limitations of managing unanticipated risks. In times
of market stress, limited liquidity or other unforeseen
circumstances, previously uncorrelated indicators
may become correlated, or previously correlated
indicators may move in different directions.
Additionally, sudden illiquidity in markets or declines
in prices of certain assets may make it more difficult
to value certain financial instruments. These types of
market movements have at times limited the
effectiveness of our hedging strategies and have
caused us to incur significant losses, and they may do
so in the future.
Weaknesses in model design, implementation or
governance may result in flawed outputs, increasing
risks. Inaccuracies in input data or issues with data
quality or effectiveness can further amplify these
risks. To the extent that our models utilize data
provided by third parties, deficiencies in the accuracy,
timeliness or completeness of third-party data or the
effectiveness in our controls and validation processes,
could further amplify these risks. Models utilizing
artificial intelligence, machine learning or other
emerging technologies present additional challenges,
including biases in algorithms or datasets, potentially
leading to ineffective decision-making, reporting
errors or other unintended consequences.
Weaknesses in model risk management practices,
including lapses in oversight, monitoring and
application, could negatively impact business
operations and regulatory compliance. Failure to
identify or address deficiencies promptly may result
in operational losses, penalties, increased capital
requirements or reputational harm.
Although we have implemented policies, procedures
and controls designed to mitigate model risk, these
measures cannot fully eliminate the inherent
limitations of modeling practices. If our models fail
to measure, monitor or predict risks appropriately, we
could face financial losses, reputational harm,
regulatory actions and material impacts on our
business and financial results.
A communications or technology disruption or
failure within our infrastructure or the
infrastructure of third parties that results in a loss
of information, delays our ability to access
information or impacts our ability to provide
services to our clients may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results
of operations.
We extensively rely on communications and
information systems to conduct our business. Our
businesses are highly dependent on our ability to
process large volumes of data in an accurate,
complete and timely manner, which requires global
capabilities and scale from our technology platforms.
If our technology or communications fail, or those of
industry utilities or our service providers fail, we have
in the past experienced, and could in the future
experience, production and system outages or
failures, or other significant operational delays. In
addition, any technology disruption or failure could
result in the loss of confidential or customer data, as a
result of which we could incur losses, suffer
reputational damage, face significant remediation
expenses or find ourselves out of compliance with
applicable regulatory or contractual mandates or
supervisory expectations with respect to the
preservation of confidential information. Any such
disruption, outage, failure or delay could adversely
affect our ability to effect transactions or service our
clients, which could expose us to liability for
damages, result in the loss of business, damage our
reputation, subject us to regulatory scrutiny or
sanctions or expose us to litigation, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Remote
work arrangements have increased our reliance on
remote access systems and video conferencing
services, and, as a result, we are exposed to similar
risks if the technology and communications systems
our employees or employees of third parties use while
working remotely fail. Security or technology
disruptions, failures or delays that impact our
communications or information systems could also
adversely affect our ability to manage our exposure to
risk or expand our business. These incidents are
unpredictable and can arise from numerous sources,
not all of which are in our control, including, among
others, human error, malfeasance and other
misconduct, as well as operational disruptions at a
third party or third party’s downstream service
provider.
Upgrading our computer systems, software and
networks may be time-consuming and may subject us
to the risk of disruptions, failures or delays due to the
complexity and interconnectedness of our computer
systems, software and networks. The failure to
properly upgrade or maintain these computer systems,
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 83
software and networks could result in greater
susceptibility to cyberattacks, particularly in light of
the greater frequency and severity of cyberattacks in
recent years, as well as the growing prevalence of
cyberattacks affecting third-party software and
information service providers. Additionally, cloud
technologies are becoming increasingly critical to the
operation of our systems and platforms, and, as our
reliance on this technology continues to grow, we will
continue to be increasingly subject to evolving risks
relating to the use of cloud technologies. Our new
product initiatives, including in connection with
digital asset services, may further expose us to new
and evolving technology risks and may lead to
dependencies on, and compatibility issues with,
decentralized or third-party blockchains and their
protocols, which we do not control. Although we
have programs and processes to identify such risks,
there can be no assurance that any such disruptions,
failures or delays will not occur or, if they do occur,
that actions taken to mitigate their impact will be
timely or adequate. Although we maintain insurance
covering certain technology infrastructure losses and
intend to maintain such insurance coverage if it is
available to us on commercially reasonable terms,
there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses we
may incur, including as a result of a cybersecurity
incident, will be covered under such policies or that
the amount of insurance will be adequate.
We continue to evaluate and seek opportunities to
strengthen our business continuity and operational
resiliency capabilities and have increased our
investments in technology to steadily enhance those
capabilities, including our ability to resume and
sustain our operations. There can be no guarantee,
however, that a technology outage will not occur,
including as a result of failures related to upgrades
and maintenance, that our incident response processes
will be effective to efficiently identify and respond to
an adverse event, or that our business continuity and
operational resiliency capabilities will enable us to
maintain our operations and appropriately respond to
events. For a discussion of operational risk, see “Risk
Management – Risk Types Overview – Operational
Risk.”
Third parties with which we do business or that
facilitate our business activities, including exchanges,
clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors
that provide services or security solutions for our
operations, have in the past been, and could in the
future also be, sources of technology risk to us,
including from breakdowns, capacity constraints,
attacks (including cyberattacks targeted at
downstream service providers), failures or delays of
their own systems or other services that impede their
ability to provide products or services to us, which, in
turn, could impair our ability to process transactions
and communicate with customers and counterparties.
This risk may be intensified to the extent that there is
concentration in a single unique product or service
provided by a single vendor, or to the extent we rely
on service providers from a single geographic area or
due to the nature of the third-party’s industry and
operations (e.g., firms that may have less robust scale,
financial and operational resiliency standards with
which to defend against a cyberattack). We may not
be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational
risks impacting our vendors or relating to the use of
common and other vendors by third-party service
providers, which could result in potential liability to
clients and customers, regulatory fines, penalties or
other sanctions, increased operational costs or harm
to our reputation.
As our business areas evolve, whether due to the
introduction of technology, new service offering
requirements for our clients, interactions with thirdparty service providers, or changes in regulation
relative to these service offerings, unforeseen risks
materially impacting our business operations could
arise. The technology used has become increasingly
complex and relies on the continued effectiveness of
the programming code and integrity of the inputted
data. Rapid technological changes and competitive
pressures require us to make significant and ongoing
investments in technology not only to develop
competitive new products and services or adopt new
technologies, but to sustain our current businesses.
Our financial performance depends in part on our
ability to develop and market these new products and
services in a timely manner at a competitive price and
adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate
our products or provide cost efficiencies. The failure
to adequately review and consider critical business
changes prior to and during introduction and
deployment of key technological systems, or the
failure to adequately align operational capabilities
with evolving client commitments and expectations,
subjects us to the risk of an adverse impact on our
ability to service and retain customers and on our
operations. The costs we incur in enhancing our
technology could be substantial and may not
ultimately improve our competitiveness or
profitability.
Risk Factors (continued)
84 BNY
As a result of financial entities, including financial
technology companies, central agents, clearing agents
and houses, exchanges and technology systems across
the globe becoming more interconnected and
complex, a technology failure or other operational
incident that significantly degrades, deletes or
compromises the systems or data of one or more
financial entities or suppliers increases the risk that
such disruptions could have a material impact on
counterparties or other market participants, including
us. A disruptive event, failure or delay experienced
by one institution could disrupt the functioning of the
overall financial system and has in the past impaired,
and could in the future impair, our ability to settle
transactions, which could, in turn, increase our
counterparty credit and other exposures.
A cybersecurity incident, or a failure in our
computer systems, networks and information, or
those of third parties, could result in the theft,
disclosure, use or alteration of information,
unauthorized access to or loss of information, or
system or network failures. Any such incident or
failure could adversely impact our ability to conduct
our businesses, damage our reputation and cause
losses.
We have been, and we expect to continue to be, the
target of varying degrees of attempted cyberattacks,
computer viruses or other malicious software, denial
of service efforts, phishing attacks, penetration
attempts and other information security threats
intended to disrupt our operations, including
unauthorized access attempts and cyberattacks
targeted at third-party service providers and their
downstream service providers. Remote working
arrangements, our employees’ usage of mobile and
cloud technologies and our reliance on third-party
service providers leave our networks susceptible to
greater access points for attackers to exploit. This
further increases the risk of unauthorized access to
our networks and results in greater amounts of
information being available for access, all of which
heightens risks relating to the frequency and severity
of cyberattacks against us and our third-party service
providers and their downstream service providers.
Although we deploy a broad range of sophisticated
defenses and continue to expend significant resources
to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance
that these security measures will provide absolute
security or prevent breaches and attacks, and we
could suffer a material adverse impact or disruption
as a result of a cybersecurity incident.
Cybersecurity incidents may occur through or as a
result of system errors, lack of adequate policies and
procedures, human error, software vulnerabilities
(which may be unknown), potential lapses in
information security practices or other irregularities,
and intentional or unintentional acts by individuals or
groups (including employees, vendors, customers and
state actors, as well as others with malicious intent)
having authorized or unauthorized access to our
systems, data-bearing devices or facilities as well as
the systems, devices or facilities of our clients,
counterparties or third-party service providers.
Malicious actors, who may see their effectiveness
enhanced by the use of artificial intelligence, such as
through the use of “deep-fake” technology or
quantum computing, may also attempt to place
individuals within BNY or fraudulently induce
employees, vendors, customers or other users of our
systems through social engineering, such as phishing,
to disclose sensitive information in order to gain
access to our data or that of our clients, or to send
funds or authorize the sending of funds. A
cybersecurity incident that results in the theft, loss,
disclosure, use or alteration of information (which
may include confidential or proprietary information),
system or network failures, or unauthorized access or
loss of access to information, may require us to
reconstruct lost data (which may not be possible) or
reimburse clients for data and credit monitoring
services, or result in loss of customer business or
damage to our computers or systems and those of our
customers and counterparties. Further, although the
application of distributed ledger technology is
growing, such technology is nascent and may be
vulnerable to cyberattacks or have other weaknesses,
which could result in the loss of customer assets,
including customer funds or custodied digital assets.
Losses of certain types of assets, such as digital
assets, may be distinctly difficult to recover and could
subject us to customer disputes, claims for
reimbursement, losses, negative publicity,
reputational damage and governmental and regulatory
scrutiny, investigations and enforcement actions.
Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global
basis in both frequency and magnitude as threat
actors are becoming increasingly sophisticated in
using novel techniques and tools, including artificial
intelligence and other emerging technologies, that
have the potential to circumvent controls, evade
detection and even remove forensic evidence. Thus,
the risk of an occurrence of a cybersecurity incident is
inherent to a decision to invest in our company and
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 85
the financial services sector as a whole. These
impacts could be costly and time-consuming and
could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
While we seek to mitigate these risks to ensure the
integrity of our systems and information and
continuously evolve our cybersecurity capabilities,
there can be no assurance that our mitigation
strategies will be effective against all forms of
cyberattacks. It is also possible that employees or
services providers may not follow our policies and
procedures and we may not anticipate or implement
effective preventive measures against all
cybersecurity threats, or detect all such threats,
including because the techniques used change,
develop and evolve frequently or are not recognized
until after they are launched. Third parties with
which we do business or that facilitate our business
activities are also subject to the foregoing risks, and
we can not guarantee that they will maintain effective
systems and controls to mitigate and respond to these
threats, or that they will properly implement and
execute the policies and processes in the manner
described to us. The failure of any third-party service
provider to promptly detect, respond to or report
cybersecurity incidents may adversely affect our
ability to effectively report or respond to
cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner.
Moreover, attacks can originate from a wide variety
of sources, including malicious actors who are
involved with organized crime or who may be linked
to terrorist organizations or state or quasi-state actors,
or from cross-contamination of legitimate parties
(including vendors and their service providers,
clients, financial market utilities and other financial
institutions). Risks relating to attacks on our vendors,
including supply chain attacks affecting our software
and information technology service providers, have
been rising as such attacks become increasingly
frequent and severe and as financial entities and
technology systems have become increasingly
consolidated, interdependent and complex.
The failure to maintain an adequate technology
infrastructure and applications with effective
cybersecurity controls relative to the type, size and
complexity of operations, markets and products
traded, access to trading venues and our market
interconnectedness could impact operations and
impede our productivity and growth, which could
cause our earnings to decline or could impact our
ability to comply with regulatory obligations, leading
to regulatory fines and sanctions. We may be
required to expend significant additional resources,
including through the use of third parties, to address
exposures arising from cybersecurity risks and
threats. Despite our procedures intended to identify
and mitigate the impact of cybersecurity incidents, a
cybersecurity incident, including as a result of a
successful cyberattack, could occur and persist for an
extended period of time before being detected. In
addition, we may not be able to identify and fully
assess the impact of a cybersecurity incident in a
timely manner. An investigation of a cybersecurity
incident is inherently unpredictable and the extent of
a particular cybersecurity incident and the path of
investigating the incident may not be immediately
clear. It may take a significant amount of time before
such an investigation can be completed and reliable
information about the incident is known. While such
an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily
know the source and extent of the harm or how best
to contain and remediate it, certain errors or actions
could be repeated or compounded before they are
discovered and remediated, and communication to the
public, clients, regulators and other stakeholders may
not be sufficiently timely or accurate, any or all of
which could further increase the costs and
consequences of a cybersecurity incident. Moreover,
as a public company subject to Exchange Act
reporting requirements, we are required to publicly
disclose certain information about a material
cybersecurity event, including the impact or
reasonably likely impact. Disclosure may be required
before the incident has been resolved or fully
investigated. As with the determination of materiality
of any other type of event, the determination
regarding the materiality of any particular
cybersecurity incident or series of related incidents
entails a facts-and-circumstances test that takes a
number of quantitative and qualitative factors into
account. As a result, our management may determine
that certain cybersecurity incidents are immaterial
and not subject to disclosure under applicable
cybersecurity regulations. For example, depending
on the particular facts and circumstances, our
management may reach such a determination if,
among other things, the incident (or a series of related
incidents) does not substantially disrupt our ability to
operate normally, or deliver our products and services
to our clients and the market on a timely basis, or
result in the loss or compromise of a significant
amount of data or potentially significant expenses or
liabilities. As a result, investors should not assume
that the absence of disclosure under the new
Risk Factors (continued)
86 BNY
regulations means that our defenses have been
successful in preventing and defending every
cyberattack directed at us or our third-party service
providers.
In addition, we rely on a variety of measures to
protect our intellectual property and proprietary
information, including copyrights, trademarks,
patents and controls on access and distribution.
These measures may not prevent misappropriation or
infringement of our intellectual property or
proprietary information and a resulting loss of
competitive advantage. Furthermore, if a third party
were to assert a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of its proprietary rights, obtained
through patents or otherwise, against us, we could be
required to spend a significant amount of resources to
defend such claims, develop alternative methods of
operations, pay substantial money damages, obtain a
license from the third party or possibly stop providing
one or more products or services. In addition, we
conduct business in various jurisdictions that may not
have comparable levels of protection for intellectual
property and proprietary information as the U.S. The
protection afforded in those jurisdictions may be less
established and/or predictable. As a result, there may
also be heightened risks associated with the potential
theft of data, proprietary information, technology and
intellectual property in those jurisdictions by
domestic or foreign actors, including private parties
and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors.
Any theft of data, proprietary information, technology
or intellectual property may negatively impact our
operations and reputation, including disrupting our
business activities in those jurisdictions.
We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to
the protection and privacy of the information of
clients, employees and others, and any failure to
comply with these laws and regulations could expose
us to liability, increased regulatory oversight and/or
reputational damage.
The development and use of artificial intelligence
present risks and challenges that may adversely
impact our business.
The use and development of artificial intelligence by
us, our third-party vendors, clients, counterparties and
other market participants in certain business
processes, models, including generative artificial
intelligence models, services or products may expose
us to risks and potential liabilities. These risks may
occur as a result of enhanced governmental or
regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns,
confidentiality or other security risks, intellectual
property concerns over data rights and protection,
heightened susceptibility to cyberattacks, increased
frequency and severity of cyberattacks, inaccurate or
biased algorithms or underlying datasets, misuse or
misappropriation as well as other factors that could
adversely affect our business, reputation and financial
results. In addition, poor implementation of artificial
intelligence, by us or our third-party providers, could
subject us to additional risks that we cannot
adequately predict or mitigate.
The failure to strategically embrace the potential of
artificial intelligence may result in a competitive
disadvantage for us. Although we are incorporating
artificial intelligence technologies into some of our
products, services and processes, if we cannot offer
new artificial intelligence-facilitated technologies as
quickly as our competitors, if our competitors
develop more cost-effective solutions or other
product offerings, or if we are not able to source
components, such as artificial intelligence chips due
to a supply chain shortage amid rising geopolitical
uncertainty, we could experience a material adverse
effect on our operating results, customer relationships
and growth opportunities.
Furthermore, the use or adoption of artificial
intelligence into our products or services may result
in exposure to claims by third parties of copyright
infringement or other intellectual property
misappropriation, which may require us to pay
compensation or license fees to third parties. The
evolving legal, regulatory and compliance framework
for artificial intelligence both in the U.S. and
internationally may also impact our ability to protect
our own data and intellectual property against
infringing use and could require changes in our
implementation of artificial intelligence technology
and increase our compliance costs and the risk of
non-compliance. Additionally, we may not be able to
control how third-party artificial intelligence that we
choose to use are developed or maintained, or how
data we input into such tools are used or disclosed,
even where we have sought protections with respect
to these matters.
We are subject to extensive government rulemaking,
policies, regulation and supervision that impact our
operations. Changes to and introduction of new
rules and regulations have compelled, and in the
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 87
future may compel, us to change how we manage
our businesses, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.
As a large, internationally active financial services
company, we operate in a highly regulated
environment, and are subject to a comprehensive
statutory and regulatory regime affecting all aspects
of our business and operations, including oversight by
governmental agencies both inside and outside the
U.S. Regulations and related regulatory guidance and
supervisory oversight impact how we analyze certain
business opportunities, our capital and liquidity
requirements, the revenue profile of certain of our
core activities, the products and services we provide,
how we manage our balance sheet, how we return
capital to shareholders, how we monitor and manage
risk and how we promote a sound governance and
control environment. Any changes to the regulatory
frameworks and environment in which we operate,
including changes to interpretation of existing and
future laws, rules and regulations, and the significant
management attention and resources necessary to
address those changes could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations and have other negative consequences.
In the future, we could become subject to additional
laws, rules and regulations, including related to the
safekeeping of client assets, cybersecurity and data
protection, digital assets, artificial intelligence and
other emerging technologies, climate risk
management and sustainability-related governance
and reporting, including additional disclosure
requirements with respect to sustainability-related
goals, investment strategies, risk management and
emissions. In addition, certain regulatory initiatives
within and outside of the U.S. may overlap and/or
conflict with each other, which could subject us to
additional compliance costs and regulatory risk. This
reflects the nature of developments relating to
cybersecurity, digital assets, artificial intelligence and
climate regulation, including the increased and ever
shifting focus globally by regulators and other
governmental authorities on these topics and the
relatively uncertain, distinct and novel nature of the
associated principles.
The evolving regulatory environment and uncertainty
about the timing and scope of future regulations may
contribute to decisions we may make to suspend,
reduce or withdraw from existing businesses,
activities or initiatives, which may result in potential
lost revenue or significant restructuring or related
costs or exposures. We also face the risk of
becoming subject to new or more stringent
requirements in connection with the introduction of
new regulations or modification of existing
regulations, which could require us to hold more
capital or liquidity, limit our ability to make
distributions or have other adverse effects on our
businesses or profitability. In addition, regulatory
responses in connection with severe market
downturns or unforeseen stress events may lead to
new rules and regulations, all of which may increase
our operational costs and alter or disrupt our planned
future strategies and actions. We are also exposed to
the risk of a special assessment, including under the
FDI Act, in the event of the failure of a bank or nonbank financial institution, which has in the past
adversely affected, and may in the future adversely
affect, our results of operations.
The monetary, tax and other policies of various
governments, agencies and regulatory authorities both
in the U.S. and globally have a significant impact on
interest rates, currencies, commodity pricing, the
imposition of tariffs, counter tariffs or other
limitations on international trade and travel, and
overall financial market performance, which can
impact our business, results of operations and capital.
Changes in these policies are beyond our control and
can be difficult to predict and we cannot determine
the ultimate effect that any such changes would have
upon our business, financial condition or results of
operations. For example, the outcome of elections in
the United States and internationally, and the
resulting political administration transition in
jurisdictions in which we operate, could result in
additional uncertainties in the regulatory and
economic landscape. Legal or regulatory changes
affecting access to financial markets can also
adversely affect us.
The regulatory and supervisory focus of U.S. banking
agencies is primarily intended to protect the safety
and soundness of the banking system and federally
insured deposits, and not to protect investors in our
securities. Regulatory and supervisory standards and
expectations both within jurisdictions (in relation to
national versus non-national financial services
providers) and across jurisdictions may be divergent
and otherwise may not be applied in a manner that is
consistent and harmonized. Additionally, banking
regulators have wide supervisory discretion in the
Risk Factors (continued)
88 BNY
ongoing examination and enforcement of applicable
banking statutes, regulations and guidelines, and may
restrict our ability to engage in certain activities or
acquisitions or may require us to limit our capital
distributions, maintain more capital or hold more
highly liquid assets.
The U.S. capital rules subject us and our U.S. banking
subsidiaries to stringent capital requirements, which
could restrict growth, activities or operations, trigger
divestiture of assets or operations or limit our ability
to return capital to shareholders.
The LCR and NSFR require us to maintain significant
holdings of high-quality and generally lower-yielding
liquid assets. In calculating the LCR and NSFR, we
must also determine which deposits should be
considered stable deposits. Stable deposits must meet
a series of requirements and typically receive
favorable treatment under the LCR and NSFR. We
use qualitative and quantitative analysis to identify
core stable deposits. It is possible that our LCR and
NSFR could fall below applicable regulatory
requirements as a consequence of the inherent
uncertainties associated with this analysis (including
as a result of regulatory changes or additional
guidance from our regulators). In addition to facing
potential regulatory consequences (which could be
significant), we may be required to remedy this
shortfall by liquidating assets in our investment
portfolio or raising additional debt, each of which
could have a material negative impact on our net
interest income.
We develop and submit plans for our rapid and
orderly resolution in the event of material financial
distress or failure to the Federal Reserve and the
FDIC. If the agencies determine that our submissions
are not credible or would not facilitate an orderly
resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and we
fail to address any such deficiencies in a timely
manner, we may be subject to more stringent capital
or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our
growth, activities or operations, or may be required to
divest assets or operations, which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Our global activities are also subject to extensive
regulation and supervision by various non-U.S.
regulators, including governments, securities
exchanges, central banks and other regulatory bodies
in the jurisdictions in which we operate, relating to,
among other things, the safeguarding, administration
and management of client assets and client funds,
regulation of markets, recovery and resolution
planning and payments and financial market
infrastructure.
Various laws, regulations, rules and directives
effective in the jurisdictions in which we operate have
an impact on our provision of many products and
services. Implementation of, and revisions to, these
laws, regulations, rules and directives have affected
our operations and risk profile. For example, the key
regulatory frameworks impacting our operations in
the EU and UK continue to diverge in a number of
respects. Further divergence in the nature and scope
of these regulations could have an adverse impact on
our results of operations and business prospects.
In addition, we are subject in our global operations to
rules and regulations relating to corrupt and illegal
payments and money laundering, economic sanctions
and embargo programs administered by the U.S.
Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar bodies
and governmental agencies worldwide, and laws
relating to doing business with certain individuals,
groups and countries, such as the U.S. Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, as
amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, the Iran Threat
Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and
the UK Bribery Act. While we have invested and
continue to invest significant resources in training and
in compliance monitoring, the geographical diversity
of our operations, employees, clients and customers,
as well as the vendors and other third parties that we
deal with, presents the risk that we may be found in
violation of such rules, regulations or laws and any
such violation could subject us to significant penalties
or adversely affect our reputation. In addition, such
rules could impact our ability to engage in business
with certain individuals, entities, groups and
countries, which could materially adversely affect
certain of our businesses and results of operations.
Government sanctions and our actions in response to
them have had, and in the future could continue to
have, a negative impact on our revenue and business.
For example, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine
in 2022, we ceased new banking business in Russia.
As a result of the implementation of data protectionrelated laws and regulations, including the EU GDPR,
the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the China
Personal Information Protection Law of 2021 and the
New York Department of Financial Services’
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 89
cybersecurity regulation, we need to allocate
additional time and resources to comply with such
laws and regulations, and our potential liability for
non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case
of data breaches has significantly increased. In
addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to
laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance,
encryption and data localization in the jurisdictions in
which we operate. Compliance with these laws and
regulations has required us to change our policies,
procedures and technology for information security
and segregation of data, which, among other things,
makes us more vulnerable to operational failures, and
to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and
regulations.
Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies,
or meet supervisory expectations, applicable to us and
our businesses could result in civil or criminal
sanctions or enforcement proceedings by regulatory
or governmental authorities, money penalties and
reputational damage, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations. If violations of legal or
regulatory requirements do occur, they could damage
our reputation, increase our legal and compliance
costs, including requiring us to devote substantial
resources towards remediation efforts, and ultimately
adversely impact our results of operations. Laws,
regulations or policies currently affecting us and our
subsidiaries, supervisory expectations, or regulatory
and governmental authorities’ interpretation of
statutes and regulations may change at any time,
which may adversely impact our business and results
of operations. See “Supervision and Regulation” for
additional information regarding the potential impact
of the regulatory environment on our business.
Regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation
could materially adversely affect our results of
operations or harm our businesses or reputation.
Like many major financial institutions, we and our
affiliates are the subject of inquiries, investigations,
lawsuits and proceedings by counterparties, clients,
other third parties, tax authorities and regulatory and
other governmental agencies in the U.S. and abroad,
as well as the Department of Justice and state
attorneys general. See “Legal proceedings” in Note
22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
for a discussion of material legal and regulatory
proceedings in which we are involved. The number
of these investigations and proceedings, as well as the
amount of penalties and fines sought, has remained
elevated for many firms in the financial services
industry, including us. We have in the past been, and
may in the future become, subject to heightened
regulatory scrutiny, inquiries or investigations, and
potentially client-related inquiries or claims, relating
to broad, industry-wide concerns that could lead to
increased expenses or reputational damage.
Regulators and other governmental authorities may
also be more likely to pursue enforcement actions, or
seek admissions of wrongdoing or guilty pleas, in
connection with the resolution of an inquiry or
investigation to the extent a firm has previously been
subject to other governmental investigations or
enforcement actions. The current trend of large
settlements by financial institutions with
governmental entities may adversely affect the
outcomes for other financial institutions in similar
actions, especially where governmental officials have
announced that the large settlements will be used as
the basis or a template for other settlements.
Separately, policymakers globally continue to focus
on protection of client assets, cybersecurity and data
protection, the improper use of electronic
communications as well as tax avoidance and
evasion.
The complexity of the federal and state regulatory
and enforcement regimes in the U.S., coupled with
the global scope of our operations and the increased
aggressiveness of the tax and regulatory environment
worldwide, also means that a single event may give
rise to a large number of overlapping investigations
and regulatory proceedings, either by multiple federal
and state agencies in the U.S. or by multiple
regulators and other governmental entities or tax
authorities in different jurisdictions. Responding to
inquiries, investigations, lawsuits and proceedings,
regardless of the ultimate outcome of the matter, is
time consuming and expensive and can divert the
attention of our senior management from our
business. The outcome of such proceedings may be
difficult to predict or estimate until late in the
proceedings, which may last a number of years.
Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to periodic
examination, special inquiries and potential
proceedings by regulatory authorities. If compliance
failures or other violations are found during an
examination, inquiry or proceeding, a regulatory
agency could initiate actions and impose sanctions for
violations, including, for example, regulatory
agreements, remediation undertakings, cease and
Risk Factors (continued)
90 BNY
desist orders, civil monetary penalties or termination
of a license and could lead to litigation by investors
or clients, any of which could cause our earnings to
decline. Further, we are subject to regulatory
settlements, orders and feedback that have in the past
contained, and in the future may continue to contain,
requirements for us to undertake certain remedial
measures, including enhancements to existing
controls, systems and procedures. Failure to
implement these remedial measures in a timely
manner could result in further adverse consequences,
such as further investigations or proceedings or
additional penalties, fines, judgments or additional
remedial actions.
Our businesses involve the risk that clients or others
may sue us, claiming that we or third parties for
whom they say we are responsible have failed to
perform under a contract or otherwise failed to carry
out a duty perceived to be owed to them, including
perceived fiduciary or contractual duties. This risk
may be heightened during periods when credit, equity
or other financial markets are deteriorating in value or
are particularly volatile, when clients or investors are
experiencing losses or as public attention on issues
such as climate change or other sustainability-related
matters intensifies. In some cases, additional third
parties that would otherwise be defendants in such
cases, or that have agreed to indemnify for such
losses, may be bankrupt or in financial distress, or
may not honor their obligations. As a publicly held
company, we are also subject to the risk of claims
under the federal securities laws. Volatility in our
stock price increases this risk.
Increasingly, regulators, tax authorities and courts
have sought to hold financial institutions liable for the
misconduct of their clients where such regulators and
courts have determined that the financial institution
should have detected that the client was engaged in
wrongdoing, even though the financial institution had
no direct knowledge of the wrongdoing.
Actions brought against us may result in lawsuits,
enforcement actions, injunctions, settlements,
damages, fines or penalties, which could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition or
results of operations or require changes to our
business. Claims for significant monetary damages
are asserted in many of these legal actions, while
claims for disgorgement, penalties and/or other
remedial sanctions may be sought in regulatory
matters. These risks may be more acute when
operating in foreign jurisdictions or in instances
where adversaries to such disputes are government or
quasi-government actors otherwise motivated in
whole or in part by non-commercial incentives.
Although we establish accruals for our litigation and
regulatory matters in accordance with applicable
accounting guidance, our exposure to such litigation
and regulatory matters can be unpredictable, and
when those matters proceed to a stage where they
present loss contingencies that are both probable and
reasonably estimable, there may be a material
exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued, or
in excess of any loss contingencies disclosed as
reasonably possible. Such loss contingencies may not
be probable and reasonably estimable until the
proceedings have progressed significantly, which
could take several years and occur close to resolution
of the matter.
Each of the risks outlined above could result in
increased regulatory supervision and affect our ability
to attract and retain customers or maintain access to
the capital markets.
Our business may be adversely affected if we are
unable to attract, retain, develop and motivate
employees.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to
attract new employees, retain, develop and motivate
our existing employees, have a diverse and inclusive
workplace and continue to compensate our employees
competitively amid heightened regulatory restrictions.
Competition for the most skilled employees in most
activities in which we engage can be intense,
especially in critical strategic locations, and we may
not be able to recruit and retain key personnel. In
addition, third-party suppliers and service providers
on which we rely may face challenges in attracting
and retaining their employees, which may have a
negative impact on our operations and our resiliency
capabilities.
We rely on certain employees with subject matter
expertise to assist in the implementation of important
initiatives and to support the development of new
products and services, including in connection with
our technology initiatives. As focus on technology
and risk management increases in the financial
industry, competition for technologists and risk
personnel has intensified, which could constrain our
ability to execute on certain of our strategic
initiatives.
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 91
Our ability to attract, retain and motivate key
executives and other highly qualified employees may
be negatively impacted by the level and composition
of our compensation and benefits programs and by
continuous changes to immigration policies and other
restrictions applicable to incentive and other
compensation programs, including deferral, clawback
requirements and other limits on incentive
compensation. Some of these restrictions may not
apply to some of our competitors and to other
institutions with which we compete for talent, in
particular as we are more often competing for
personnel with financial technology providers and
other entities that may not be publicly traded or
regulated banking organizations and, in either case,
may not have the same limitations on compensation
as we do. Furthermore, because a portion of our
annual incentive compensation paid to some of our
employees is deferred equity that is subject to the
value of our common stock, declines in our
profitability or outlook could adversely affect the
ability to attract and retain employees. Additionally,
recent changes to our executive management may
create uncertainty, divert resources, be disruptive to
our daily operations or impact public or market
perception, any of which could result in an adverse
impact on our business.
The loss of employees’ skills, knowledge of the
market and industry experience, and the cost of
finding replacements, particularly in competitive
labor markets, have led, and may continue to lead, to
an increase in labor costs, which may hurt our
business. In addition, our current or future approach
to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not
meet the needs or expectations of our current or
prospective employees, may not be perceived as
favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by
competitors and may not be conducive to a
collaborative working environment, which could
adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, develop
and motivate employees. If we are unable to continue
to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly
qualified employees, our performance, including our
competitive position, could be adversely affected.
A failure or circumvention of our controls, policies
and procedures could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of
operations and reputation.
Management regularly reviews and updates our
internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures,
and corporate policies and procedures. Any system
of controls, however well designed and operated, is
based in part on certain assumptions and can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the
objectives of the system will be met. Any failure or
circumvention of our controls and procedures or
failure to comply with regulations related to controls
and procedures could have a material adverse effect
on our business, reputation, results of operations and
financial condition. Moreover, if we identify material
weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting or are otherwise required to restate our
financial statements, we could be required to
implement expensive and time-consuming remedial
measures and could lose investor confidence in the
accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.
In addition, there are risks that individuals, either
employees or contractors, may circumvent
established control mechanisms in order to, for
example, exceed exposure, liquidity, trading or
investment management limitations, or commit fraud.
We are also subject to additional risks that the third
parties with which we do business fail to comply with
our policies and procedures or fail to notify us
promptly of any noncompliance.
Additionally, although we have policies and
procedures prohibiting the use of unauthorized
personal devices and applications by our employees
and contractors, we are subject to inquiries by
regulators with respect to recordkeeping obligations
and are subject to additional risks related to the use of
personal devices and non-approved platforms,
applications and tools by our employees or by third
parties with which we do business for work-related
activities, including risks related to information
security and potential violations of record retention,
reporting and other requirements. Any failure to
comply with such policies and procedures could
adversely affect our business.
Market Risk
Weakness and volatility in financial markets and the
economy generally may materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
As a financial institution, our Investment
Management, Wealth Management, Pershing,
Depositary Receipts and Markets, including
Securities Lending, businesses are particularly
sensitive to economic and market conditions,
Risk Factors (continued)
92 BNY
including in the capital and credit markets. Further,
when these markets are volatile or disruptive, we
have experienced declines in our fair valued assets,
including in our securities portfolio and seed capital,
as well as a fair value reduction in the portfolios that
we manage that generate investment and wealth
management fees. Conditions in the financial
markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S.
and elsewhere around the world have materially
affected, and may continue to affect, our results of
operations, including investment management fees.
Foreign exchange trading that we execute for clients
generates revenues which are primarily driven by the
volume of client transactions and the spread realized
on these transactions, both of which are impacted by
market volatility and the impact of foreign exchange
hedging activities. Our clients’ cross-border
investing activity could decrease in reaction to
economic and political uncertainties, including
changes in laws or regulations governing cross-border
transactions, such as currency controls or tariffs.
Volumes and/or spreads in some of our products tend
to benefit from currency volatility and are likely to
decrease during times of lower currency volatility.
Such revenues also depend on our ability to manage
the risk associated with the currency transactions we
execute and program pricing.
A variety of factors impact global economies and
financial markets, including interest rates and their
associated yield curves, commodity pricing, market
and political instabilities, volatile debt and equity
market values, inflation, expectations relating to
inflation trends and monetary policy actions taken by
central banks, the strength of the U.S. dollar,
geopolitical tensions, the imposition of tariffs,
counter tariffs or other limitations on international
trade or travel, including changes to international
trade and investment policies by the U.S., the EU or
other large economies (which could disrupt world
trade, lead to trade retaliation and other supply chain
complications), unemployment levels, labor strikes,
declining business, investor and consumer
confidence, recessionary fears, the impact of
volatility in digital asset markets on the broader
market, governmental budget deficits (including, in
the U.S., at the federal, state and municipal levels),
partial or full government shutdowns (including
concerns about the stability of funding for the U.S.
federal government) and contagion risk from possible
default on sovereign debt. More specifically, in
recent years, the U.S. government has approached its
statutory debt limit, which required specific measures
taken by the U.S. Treasury Department to prevent the
U.S. government’s default on its payment obligations.
In the future, delays to raise or suspend the federal
debt ceiling in similar circumstances could have
severe repercussions within the U.S. and to global
credit and financial markets and could result in a
variety of adverse effects for our business, results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Any resulting economic pressure on market
participants and lack of confidence in the financial
markets may adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. Additionally,
global economies and financial markets may be
adversely affected by widespread health emergencies,
pandemics, natural disasters, climate-related
incidents, conflicts and acts of war (such as the
conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East),
terrorism, economic sanctions, other geopolitical
events, for example, the economic and geopolitical
challenges related to China, including developing
tensions between China and Taiwan and/or between
China and the U.S., or concerns over the possible
escalation, continuation or duration of such events.
In particular, we face the following risks in
connection with these factors, some of which are
discussed at greater length in separate risk factors:
• Geopolitical tension and economic instability in
countries around the world can at times increase
the demand for low-risk investments, particularly
in U.S. Treasuries and the dollar. A “flight to
safety” has historically increased our balance
sheet, which has negatively impacted, and could
continue to negatively impact, our leverage-based
regulatory capital measures. A sustained “flight
to safety” has historically triggered a decline in
trading, capital markets and cross-border activity
which would likely decrease our revenue,
negatively impacting our results of operations,
financial condition and, if sustained in the long
term, our business.
• The fees earned by our Investment Management
and Wealth Management businesses are higher as
assets under management and/or investment
performance increase. Those fees are also
impacted by the composition of the assets under
management, with higher fees for some asset
categories as compared to others. Uncertain and
volatile capital markets, particularly declines,
could result in movements from higher to lower
fee products and/or reductions in our assets under
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 93
management because of investors’ decisions to
withdraw assets or from simple declines in the
value of assets under management as markets
decline.
• Market conditions resulting in lower transaction
volumes could have an adverse effect on the
revenues and profitability of certain of our
businesses such as clearing, settlement, payments
and trading.
• The discontinuation of an interest rate
benchmark, and the adoption and implementation
of alternative reference rates, could adversely
impact our business activities and our underlying
operations. We utilize reference rates in a variety
of agreements and instruments and are
responsible for the use of reference rates in a
variety of capacities, as well as in our operational
functions. We could be subject to claims from
customers, counterparties, investors or regulators
alleging that we did not correctly discharge our
responsibilities in interpreting and implementing
contractual interest rate provisions or in selecting
new alternative reference rates. These types of
claims could subject us to increased legal and
operational expenses and could damage our
reputation.
• Uncertain and volatile capital markets,
particularly declines in equity prices, could
reduce the value of our investments in securities,
including pension and other post-retirement plan
assets and produce downward pressure on our
stock price and credit availability without regard
to our underlying financial strength.
• Derivative instruments we hold for our own
account to hedge and manage our exposure to
market risks, including interest rate risk, equity
price risk, foreign currency risk and credit risk
associated with our products and businesses
might not perform as intended or expected,
resulting in higher realized losses and unforeseen
stresses on liquidity. Our derivatives-based
hedging strategies also rely on the performance of
counterparties to such derivatives. These
counterparties may fail to perform for various
reasons resulting in losses on under-collateralized
positions.
• The process we use to estimate our expected
credit losses is subject to uncertainty in that it
requires use of statistical models and difficult,
subjective and complex judgments, including
forecasts of economic conditions and how these
conditions might impair the ability of our
borrowers and others to meet their obligations. In
uncertain and volatile economic environments,
and especially in environments that differ
significantly from the historical environments
upon which the models we use to estimate our
expected credit losses were developed, our ability
to estimate our expected credit losses may be
impaired, which could adversely affect our
overall profitability and results of operations.
For a discussion of our management of market risk,
see “Risk Management – Risk Types Overview –
Market Risk.”
We are dependent on fee-based business for a
substantial majority of our revenue and our feebased revenues could be adversely affected by
slowing market activity, weak financial markets,
underperformance and/or negative trends in savings
rates or in investment preferences.
Our principal commercial focus is on fee-based
business, which is distinct from commercial banking
institutions that earn most of their revenues from
loans and other traditional interest-generating
products and services. For the year ended Dec. 31,
2024, 73% of our total revenue was fee-based. Our
fee-based businesses include investment and wealth
management, custody, corporate trust, depositary
receipts, clearing, collateral management and treasury
services, which are highly competitive businesses.
Fees for many of our products and services are based
on the volume of transactions processed, the market
value of assets managed and/or administered,
securities lending volume and spreads, and fees for
other services rendered. Corporate actions, crossborder investing, global mergers and acquisitions
activity, new debt and equity issuances, and
secondary trading volumes, among other things, all
affect the level of our fee revenue. As the volume of
these activities decreases due to low client activity,
weak financial markets or otherwise, our fee-based
revenues also decrease, which negatively impacts our
results of operations.
If our Investment and Wealth Management
businesses experience poor investment returns due to
weak market conditions or underperformance
(relative to competitors or benchmarks), the market
values of the portfolios that we manage will be lower
(on a relative basis) and our ability to retain existing
Risk Factors (continued)
94 BNY
assets and/or attract new client assets may be
impacted. Market and regulatory trends have also
resulted in increased demand for lower fee investment
and wealth management products and services, and
lower performance-fee structures, both of which have
impacted and may continue to impact our fee
revenue. Some of these dynamics have also
negatively impacted fees in our Market and Wealth
Services and Securities Services businesses and any
of these dynamics may also occur in the future.
Significant declines in the volume of capital markets
activity would reduce the number of transactions we
process and the amount of securities we lend and
therefore would also have an adverse effect on our
results of operations. Our business may be adversely
impacted by decreases in the rate at which individuals
invest in mutual funds and other collective funds, unit
investment trusts or exchange-traded funds, or
contribute to defined contribution plans. Changes in
economic and market conditions, including as a result
of higher market volatility, inflationary pressures,
recessionary conditions or declines in equity values,
could result in changes in the investment patterns of
our clients or negatively impact the market value of
client portfolios, each of which could have a negative
impact on our results of operations.
When our investment management revenues decline,
interest rates rise or other market factors affect the
value of our investment management business, we
may have, and in the past have had, declines in the
fair value in our Investment Management reporting
unit, one of the two reporting units in our Investment
and Wealth Management segment. If the fair value of
the Investment Management reporting unit declines
below its carrying value, we would be required to
take, and in the past have taken, an impairment
charge.
Levels of and changes in interest rates have
impacted, and will in the future continue to impact,
our profitability and capital levels, at times
adversely.
We earn revenue, known as “net interest income,” on
the difference between the interest income earned on
our interest-earning assets, such as the loans we make
and the securities we hold in our investment securities
portfolio, and the interest expense incurred on our
interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and
borrowed money. Additionally, we earn net interest
income on other activities relating to interest-earning
assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such as reverse
repurchase agreements and repurchase agreements,
respectively. Our net interest margin, which is the
result of dividing net interest income by average
interest-earning assets, is sensitive to the shape of the
yield curve and whether the interest rate paid or
received is fixed or moves with changes in market
interest rates.
The continued prevalence of higher rates, and any
future rate increases, including unexpectedly
precipitous increases, could adversely impact our
business, financial condition and results of
operations, due to:
• higher market volatility, recessionary conditions
and declines in equity values, resulting in a
decline in the valuation of assets under
management;
• reduced liquidity in bonds and fixed-income
funds, resulting in lower performance and fees;
• increased number of delinquencies, bankruptcies
or defaults and more nonperforming assets and
net charge-offs, as borrowers may have more
difficulty making higher interest payments;
• higher redemptions from our fixed-income funds
or separate accounts, as clients move funds into
investments with higher rates of return;
• lower net interest income and net interest margin
due to lower non-interest bearing deposit levels,
as non-interest bearing deposits leave or shift to
interest-bearing deposits;
• declines in deposit levels, resulting in reduced
internal and regulatory liquidity buffers and lower
revenues;
• reductions in the value of our fixed-income
securities held for liquidity purposes;
• further increases in accumulated other
comprehensive loss in our shareholders’ equity
and therefore our tangible common equity due to
the impact of rising long-term rates on the
available-for-sale securities in our investment
portfolio, which would negatively affect our riskbased and leverage based regulatory capital
ratios; or
• higher funding cost.
Conversely, a material decline in the short-term rate
environment, and/or a flat or inverted yield curve, in
the future could adversely impact, and has in the past
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 95
adversely impacted, our net interest income and
results of operations due to:
• compression of our net interest margin,
depending on our balance sheet position and the
speed and size of the interest rate decline;
• sustained weakness of our spread-based revenues,
resulting in continued voluntary waiving of fees
on certain money market mutual funds and
related distribution fees, in order to prevent the
yields on such funds from becoming uneconomic;
or
• adverse impacts on the value of our fixed-rate
mortgage-backed securities, driven by higher
mortgage prepayment speeds.
Our business activities involve investing in interestbearing assets and incurring interest-bearing liabilities
with varying durations. Changes in the direction and
levels of interest rates, the relationship between shortand long-term rates and the speed of interest rate
changes have in the past impacted, and in the future
are expected to continue to impact, our net interest
margin, capital ratios and overall financial position.
Changes in the direction and level of interest rates
may also have adverse impacts on our clients and
counterparties, which could adversely impact
multiple aspects of our business, including our fee
revenue, allowance for credit losses and deposit mix.
Although we have policies and procedures in place to
assess and mitigate the potential impacts of changes
in the direction and level of interest rates, these
policies and procedures may not be able to effectively
mitigate these risks. If our assumptions about any
number of factors used in our interest rate models are
incorrect, or if there are unforeseen changes in
external environment that are out of our control, it
could negatively impact our results of operation and
financial position.
A more detailed discussion of the interest rate and
market risks we face is contained in “Risk
Management – Risk Types Overview – Market Risk.”
We have experienced, and may continue to
experience, unrealized or realized losses on
securities related to volatile and illiquid market
conditions, reducing our capital levels and/or
earnings.
We maintain an investment securities portfolio of
various holdings, types and maturities. At Dec. 31,
2024, approximately 64% of these securities were
classified as available-for-sale, which are recorded on
our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains
or losses reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income, net of tax. The
securities in our held-to-maturity portfolio, recorded
on our balance sheet at amortized cost, were
approximately 36% of our securities portfolio at Dec.
31, 2024. Our available-for-sale securities portfolio,
to the extent unhedged, may result in increased
volatility in our accumulated other comprehensive
income or earnings relative to a loan portfolio that is
accounted for at amortized cost.
Our investment securities portfolio represents a
greater proportion of our consolidated total assets
(approximately 33% at Dec. 31, 2024), in comparison
to many other major U.S. financial institutions due to
our custody and trust bank business model.
Accordingly, our capital levels and results of
operations and financial condition are materially
exposed to the risks associated with our investment
securities portfolio, including interest rate-related
risks.
We reserve for current expected credit losses with
respect to our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
securities. Credit losses in excess of our allowance
for credit losses would impact our results of
operations.
Under the U.S. capital rules, after-tax changes in the
fair value of available-for-sale investment securities
are included in CET1 capital. Since held-to-maturity
securities are not subject to fair-value accounting,
changes in the fair value of these instruments (other
than expected credit losses) are not similarly included
in the determination of CET1 capital. As a result, we
may experience increased variability in our CET1
capital relative to those major financial institutions
who maintain a lower proportion of their consolidated
total assets in an available-for-sale accounting
classification.
Generally, the fair value of available-for-sale
securities is determined based on market prices
available from third-party sources. During periods of
market disruption, it may be difficult to value certain
of our investment securities if trading becomes less
frequent and/or market data becomes less observable.
As a result, valuations may include inputs and
assumptions that are less observable or require greater
estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods

ultimately realizable in a market transaction, and such
values may change very rapidly as market conditions
change and valuation assumptions are modified.
Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect
on our results of operations or financial condition.
The estimate of expected credit losses is determined
in part by management’s assessment of the financial
condition and prospects of a particular issuer,
projections of future cash flows and recoverability of
the particular security. Management’s conclusions on
such assessments are highly judgmental and include
assumptions and projections of future cash flows
which may ultimately prove to be incorrect as
assumptions, facts and circumstances change. On the
other hand, we are limited in the actions we can take
related to our held-to-maturity securities absent a
significant deterioration in the issuer’s
creditworthiness. Therefore, we may be constrained
in our ability to liquidate a held-to-maturity security
that is deteriorating in value. If our determinations
change about our intention or ability to not sell
available-for-sale securities that have experienced a
reduction in fair value below their amortized cost, we
could be required to recognize a loss in earnings for
the entire difference between fair value and amortized
cost.

portfolio, refer to “Results of Operations –
Consolidated balance sheet review – Securities.”
Credit Risk
The failure or perceived weakness of any of our
significant clients or counterparties, many of whom
are major financial institutions or sovereign entities,
and our assumption of credit, counterparty and
concentration risk, could expose us to credit losses
and adversely affect our business.
We have credit exposure to clients and counterparties
in many different industries, particularly financial
institutions, as a result of trading, clearing and
financing, providing custody services, securities
lending services or other relationships. We routinely
execute transactions with global clients and
counterparties in the financial industry as well as
sovereigns and other governmental or quasigovernmental entities. Our direct credit exposure
consists of extensions of secured and unsecured credit
to clients and use of our balance sheet. In addition to
traditional credit activities, we also extend intraday
credit in order to facilitate our various processing,
settlement and intermediation activities. We could be
adversely affected by the actions and commercial
soundness of organizations to whom we have lent
funds, as defaults or non-performance (or even
uncertainty concerning such default or nonperformance) by one or more of these institutions, or
the markets generally, have in the past led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or
defaults by us or by other institutions (including our
counterparties and/or clients) in the future. The
consolidation and failures of financial institutions
during the 2008 financial crisis increased the
concentration of our client and counterparty risk.
As a result of our membership in several industry
clearing or settlement exchanges and central
counterparty clearinghouses, we may be required to
guarantee obligations and liabilities or provide
financial support in the event that other members do
not honor their obligations or default. These
obligations may be limited to members that dealt with
the defaulting member or to the amount (or a multiple
of the amount) of our contribution to a clearing or
settlement exchange guarantee fund, or, in a few
cases, the obligation may be unlimited. Additionally,
we are exposed to settlement risks, particularly in our
payments and foreign exchange activities. Those
activities may lead to extensions of credit and
consequent losses in the event of a counterparty
breach or an operational error, including the failure to
provide credit. We are exposed to risk of short-term
credit extensions to, or overdrafts by, our clients in
connection with the process to facilitate settlement of
trades and related foreign exchange activities,
particularly when contractual settlement has been
agreed with our clients. The occurrence of overdrafts
at peak volatility could create significant credit
exposure to our clients depending upon the value of
such clients’ collateral pledged to us at the time. This
risk may be heightened during periods of market
volatility, during which collateral values may
decrease suddenly.
When we provide credit to clients in connection with
providing cash management, clearing, custodial and
other services, we are exposed to potential loss if the
client experiences credit difficulties. Higher market
volatility, inflationary pressures, recessionary
conditions or declines in equity values could
negatively affect the creditworthiness of our clients,
which, in turn, would increase our credit risk. We are
also generally not able to net exposures across
affiliated clients or counterparties and may not be
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 97
able to net exposures to the same legal entity across
multiple products. In addition, we may incur a loss in
relation to one entity or product even though our
exposure to one of the entity’s affiliates is overcollateralized. Moreover, not all of our client or
counterparty credit exposure is secured.
In our agency securities lending program, we act as
agent on behalf of our clients, the lenders of
securities, in securities lending transactions with our
clients’ counterparties (including broker-dealers),
acting as borrowers, wherein securities are lent by our
clients and the securities loans are collateralized by
cash or securities posted by such counterparties.
Typically, in the case of cash collateral, our clients
authorize us as their agent to invest the cash collateral
in approved investments pursuant to each client’s
investment guidelines and instructions. Such
approved investments may include reverse repurchase
transactions with repo counterparties. In many cases,
in the securities loans we enter into on behalf of our
clients, we agree to replace the client’s loaned
securities that the borrower fails to return due to
certain defaults by the borrower, mainly the
borrower’s insolvency. Therefore, in situations
where the market value of the loaned securities that
the borrower fails to return to a client (which loaned
securities we are obligated to replace and return to the
client) exceeds the amount of proceeds resulting from
the liquidation of the client’s approved investments
and cash and non-cash collateral of such client, we
may be responsible for the shortfall amount necessary
to purchase any replacement securities. In addition,
in certain cases, we may also assume the risk of loss
related to approved investments that are reverse
repurchase transactions as described above. In these
two scenarios, we, rather than our clients, are exposed
to the risks of the defaulting counterparty in the
securities lending transactions and, where applicable,
in the reverse repurchase transactions. For further
discussion on our securities lending indemnifications,
see “Commitments and contingent liabilities – Offbalance sheet arrangements” in Note 22 of the Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.
From time to time, we assume concentrated credit
risk at the individual obligor, counterparty or group
level, potentially exposing us to a single market or
political event or a correlated set of events. For
example, we may be exposed to defaults by
companies located in countries with deteriorating
economic conditions or by companies in certain
industries. Our commercial real estate portfolio also
exposes us to concentrated credit risk, including to
the New York metro market. Such concentrations
may be material. Our counterparty exposures change
daily, and the counterparties or groups of related
counterparties to which our risk exposure is material
also vary during any reported period; however, our
largest exposures tend to be to other financial
institutions, clearing organizations and governmental
entities, both inside and outside the U.S.
Concentration of counterparty exposure presents
significant risks to us and to our clients because the
failure or perceived weakness of our counterparties
(or in some cases of our clients’ counterparties) has
the potential to expose us to risk of financial loss.
Changes in market perception of the financial
strength of particular financial institutions or
sovereign issuers can occur rapidly, are often based
on a variety of factors and are difficult to predict.
Although our overall business is subject to these
interdependencies, several of our businesses are
particularly sensitive to them, including our currency
and other trading activities, our securities lending and
securities finance businesses and our investment
management business. If we experience any of the
losses described above, it may materially and
adversely affect our results of operations.
We are also subject to the risk that our contractual
rights against third parties may not be enforceable in
all circumstances. In addition, deterioration in the
credit quality of third parties whose securities or
obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the
value of collateral posted by third parties to secure
their obligations to us under derivatives contracts and
other agreements, could result in losses and/or
adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or
otherwise use those securities or obligations for
liquidity purposes. Disputes with clients and
counterparties as to the valuation of collateral can
significantly increase in times of market stress and
illiquidity. In addition, disruptions in the liquidity or
transparency of the financial markets may result in
our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of
our positions, thereby leading to increased
concentrations. An inability to reduce our positions
may not only increase the market and credit risks
associated with such positions but may also increase
the level of RWA on our balance sheet, thereby
increasing our capital requirements and funding costs,
all of which could adversely affect the operations and
profitability of our businesses.
Risk Factors (continued)
98 BNY
Under U.S. regulatory restrictions on credit exposure,
which include a broadening of the measure of credit
exposure, we are required to limit our exposures to
specific obligors or groups, including financial
institutions. These regulatory credit exposure
restrictions may adversely affect our businesses and
may require us to modify our operating models or the
policies and practices we use.
Further, we maintain sub-custodian relationships in
certain jurisdictions, including emerging and other
underdeveloped markets. Our use of sub-custodians
exposes us to operational, reputational and regulatory
risk, as we are dependent upon such sub-custodians to
perform certain services to clients in those markets.
The risks of maintaining custody services in such
markets are amplified due to evolving regulatory and
sanctions requirements, which may increase our
financial exposures, in the event those subcustodians, or we, are unable to return, transfer or
reinvest clients’ assets. Under certain regulatory
regimes, we may be held responsible for resulting
losses suffered by our clients, and we may agree to
similar or more stringent standards with clients that
are not subject to such regulations. Where we have
client deposit liabilities related to non-U.S. currencies
in jurisdictions where we maintain sub-custodian
relationships, we generally maintain a corresponding
amount of cash on deposit with the relevant subcustodian or clearing agency, which increases our
credit exposure to that entity and can accumulate over
time based upon distributions on, or other activities
related to, our clients’ assets. If the sub-custodian or
clearing agency were to become insolvent in
circumstances not involving expropriation of assets or
other circumstances that may excuse performance
under relevant client agreements, the risk of loss on
such cash on deposit could be ours rather than the
clients’.
We could incur losses if our allowance for credit
losses, including loan and lending-related
commitment reserves, is inadequate or if our
expectations of future economic conditions
deteriorate.
When we loan money, commit to loan money or
provide credit or enter into another contract with a
counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of loss if
our borrowers do not repay their loans or our
counterparties fail to perform according to the terms
of their agreements. Our profitability is adversely
affected when our borrowers default, in whole or in
part, on their loan obligations to us or when there is a
significant deterioration in the credit quality of our
loan portfolio. We reserve for potential future credit
losses by recording a provision for credit losses
through earnings. The allowance for loan losses and
allowance for lending-related commitments
represents management’s estimate of current expected
credit losses over the lifetime of the related credit
exposure taking into account relevant information
about past events, current conditions and reasonable
and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions that affect the collectability of our loans
and lending commitments. We use a quantitative
methodology and qualitative framework for
determining the allowance for loan losses and the
allowance for lending-related commitments. Within
this qualitative framework, management applies
judgment when assessing internal risk factors and
environmental factors to compute an additional
allowance for each component of the loan portfolio.
As is the case with any such judgments, we could fail
to identify these factors or accurately estimate their
impact. We cannot provide any assurance as to
whether charge-offs related to our credit exposure
may occur in the future. Current and future market
and economic developments may increase default and
delinquency rates and negatively impact the quality of
our credit portfolio, which may impact our chargeoffs. Although our estimates contemplate current
conditions and how we expect them to change over
the life of the portfolio, it is reasonably possible that
actual conditions could be worse than anticipated in
those estimates, which could materially affect our
results of operations and financial condition. See
“Results of Operations – Critical accounting
estimates.”
Capital and Liquidity Risk
Our business, financial condition and results of
operations could be adversely affected if we do not
effectively manage our liquidity.
Our operating model and overall strategy rely heavily
on our access to financial market utilities and global
capital markets. Without such access, it would be
difficult to process payments and settle and clear
transactions on behalf of our clients. Deterioration in
our liquidity position, whether actual or perceived,
can impact our market access by affecting
participants’ willingness to transact with us. Changes
to our liquidity can be caused by various factors, such
as funding mismatches, a failure in our asset/liability
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 99
management, market constraints disabling asset to
cash conversion, inability to issue debt on terms
acceptable to us, run-offs of core deposits and
contingent liquidity events such as additional
collateral posting. Changes in economic conditions
or exposure to credit, market, operational, legal and
reputational risks can also affect our liquidity.
Our business is dependent in part on our ability to
meet our cash and collateral obligations at a
reasonable cost for both expected and unexpected
cash flows. We also must manage liquidity risks on
an intraday basis, in a manner designed to ensure that
we can access required funds during the business day
to make payments or settle immediate obligations,
often in real time. We receive client deposits through
a variety of investment management and investment
servicing businesses and we rely on those deposits as
a low-cost and stable source of funding. Our ability
to continue to receive those deposits, and other shortterm funding sources, is subject to variability based
on a number of factors, including volume and
volatility in the global securities markets, the relative
interest rates that we are prepared to pay for those
deposits and the perception of the safety of those
deposits or other short-term obligations relative to
alternative short-term investments available to our
clients. We could lose deposits if we suffer a
significant decline in the level of our business
activity, our credit ratings are materially downgraded,
interest rates continue to rise or remain at elevated
levels, or if we or our peers become subject to
significant negative press or significant regulatory
action or litigation, among other reasons. Our
liquidity could also be adversely affected by
customers’ withdrawal of deposits in response to
volatility and disruptions in the financial markets or a
stress event. Such stress events may impact certain
industries in which our depositors may be
concentrated or correlated and may consequently
disproportionally affect our liquidity. Further,
deposit outflows could increase if our clients and
customers with uninsured deposits look for
alternative placements for their funds amidst market
and financial industry volatility. A perceived loss of
confidence in BNY as a depository institution may be
additionally exacerbated by the speed and
pervasiveness with which information, which may be
inaccurate or incomplete, is disseminated through
social media or other internet forums. If we were to
lose a significant amount of deposits, we may need to
replace such funding with more expensive funding
and/or reduce assets, which would reduce our net
interest income.
The degree of client demand for short-term credit
tends to increase during periods of market turbulence.
For example, investors in mutual funds for which we
act as custodian may engage in significant redemption
activity due to adverse market or economic
conditions. We may then extend intraday credit to
our fund clients in order to facilitate their ability to
pay such redemptions. In addition, during periods of
market turbulence, draws under committed revolving
credit facilities that we provide to our institutional
clients may increase, and have in the past increased,
substantially. Such client demand may negatively
impact our leverage-based capital ratios, and in times
of sustained market volatility, may result in
significant leverage-based ratio declines.
In addition, our access to the debt and equity capital
markets and credit markets is a significant source of
liquidity. Events or circumstances often outside of
our control, such as market disruptions, lack of
liquidity in the markets, government fiscal and
monetary policies, uncertainty over the U.S.
government debt ceiling or loss of confidence by
securities purchasers or counterparties in us or in the
funds markets, could limit our access to capital
markets and credit markets, increase our cost of
borrowing, adversely affect our liquidity or impair
our ability to execute our business plan. In addition,
clearing organizations, regulators, clients and
financial institutions with which we interact may
exercise the right to require additional collateral
based on market perceptions or market conditions,
which could further impair our access to and cost of
funding. Market perception of sovereign default risks
can also lead to inefficient money markets and capital
markets, which could further impact our funding
availability and cost. Conversely, excess liquidity
inflows could increase interest expense, limit our
financial flexibility and increase the size of our total
assets in a manner that could have a negative impact
on our capital ratios.
Under the U.S. capital rules, the size of the capital
surcharge that applies to a U.S. G-SIB is based in part
on its reliance on short-term wholesale funding,
including certain types of deposit funding, which may
increase the cost of such funding. Furthermore,
certain non-U.S. authorities require large banks to
incorporate a separate subsidiary in countries in
which they operate and to maintain independent
Risk Factors (continued)
100 BNY
capital and liquidity at foreign subsidiaries. These
requirements could hinder our ability to efficiently
manage our funding and liquidity in a centralized
manner, requiring us to hold more capital and
liquidity overall.
In addition, our cost of funding could be affected by
actions that we may take in order to satisfy applicable
LCR and NSFR requirements, to lower our G-SIB
score, to satisfy the amount of eligible long-term debt
outstanding under the TLAC rule, to address
obligations under our resolution plan or to satisfy
regulatory requirements in non-U.S. jurisdictions
relating to the pre-positioning of liquidity in certain
subsidiaries. Further, the regulatory or stress test
liquidity value associated with the securities we hold
subject to a held-to-maturity accounting designation
could be reduced in the future through regulatory or
supervisory action, exposing us to relatively greater
capital ratio volatility attributable to interest rate
movements to the extent we designate a relatively
larger percentage of our securities portfolio as
available-for-sale going forward in response to such
regulatory or supervisory changes.
If we are unable to raise funds using the methods
described above, we would likely need to finance,
reduce or liquidate unencumbered assets, such as our
central bank deposits and bank placements, or
securities in our investment portfolio to meet funding
needs. We may be unable to sell some of our assets,
or we may have to sell assets at a discount from
market value, either of which could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Further, our ability to sell assets may be
impaired if other market participants are seeking to
sell similar assets at the same time, which could occur
in a liquidity or other market crisis. Additionally, if
we experience cash flow mismatches, deposit run-off
or market constraints resulting from our inability to
convert assets to cash or access capital markets, our
liquidity could be severely impacted. During periods
of market uncertainty, our level of client deposits has
in recent years tended to increase; however, because
these deposits have high potential run-off rates, we
have historically deposited these so-called excess
deposits with central banks and in other highly liquid
and low-yielding instruments.
If we are unable to continue to fund our assets
through deposits or access capital markets on
favorable terms or if we suffer an increase in our
borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our
liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin,
financial results and condition may be materially
adversely affected. In certain cases, this could
require us to raise additional capital through the
issuance of preferred or common stock, which could
dilute the ownership of existing stockholders and/or
reduce common stock repurchases or our common
stock dividend, to preserve capital. For a further
discussion of our liquidity, see “Results of Operations
– Liquidity and dividends.”
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” and “well managed” status or
capital adequacy and liquidity rules more generally,
could result in limitations on our activities and
adversely affect our business and financial
condition.
Under U.S. and international regulatory capital
adequacy rules and other regulatory requirements, we
and our subsidiary banks must meet or exceed
thresholds that include quantitative measures of
assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items,
subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about
components, risk weightings and other factors. As
discussed in “Supervision and Regulation,” BNY is
registered with the Federal Reserve as a BHC and an
FHC. An FHC’s ability to maintain its status as an
FHC is dependent upon a number of factors,
including its U.S. bank subsidiaries qualifying on an
ongoing basis as “well capitalized” and “well
managed” under the banking agencies’ prompt
corrective action regulations as well as applicable
Federal Reserve regulations. Failure by an FHC or
one of its U.S. bank subsidiaries to qualify as “well
capitalized” and “well managed,” if unremedied over
a period, would cause it to lose its status as an FHC
and could affect the confidence of clients in it,
compromising its competitive position. Additionally,
an FHC that does not continue to meet all the
requirements for FHC status could lose the ability to
undertake new activities or make acquisitions that are
not generally permissible without FHC status or to
continue such activities.
The failure by one of our U.S. bank subsidiaries to
maintain its status as “well capitalized” could lead to,
among other things, higher FDIC assessments and
could have reputational and associated business
consequences.
If we or our subsidiary banks fail to meet U.S. and
international minimum capital rules and other
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 101
regulatory requirements, we may not be able to
deploy capital in the operation of our business or
distribute capital to stockholders, which may
adversely affect our business.
Failure to meet any current or future capital or
liquidity requirements, including those imposed by
the U.S. capital rules, the LCR or the NSFR, or by
regulators in implementing other portions of the Basel
III framework, could materially adversely affect our
financial condition. Compliance with U.S. and
international regulatory capital and liquidity
requirements may impact our ability to return capital
to shareholders and may impact our operations by
requiring us to liquidate assets, increase borrowings,
issue additional equity or other securities, or cease or
alter certain operations, which may adversely affect
our results of operations.
Finally, our regulatory capital ratios, liquidity metrics
and related components are based on our current
interpretation, expectations and understanding of the
applicable rules and are subject to, among other
things, ongoing regulatory review, regulatory
approval of certain statistical models, additional
refinements, modifications or enhancements (whether
required or otherwise) to our models and further
implementation guidance. Any modifications
resulting from these ongoing reviews, the adoption of
new or heightened prudential regulatory
requirements, or the continued implementation of the
U.S. capital rules (such as proposed revisions to
implement and finalize the Basel III reforms), the
LCR, the NSFR, the resolution planning process and
related amendments, could result in changes in our
RWAs, capital components, liquidity inflows and
outflows, HQLA, or other elements involved in the
calculation of these measures, which could impact
regulatory capital and liquidity ratios. Further,
because operational risk is currently measured based
not only upon our historical operational loss
experience but also upon ongoing events in the
banking industry generally, our level of operational
RWAs could significantly increase or otherwise
remain elevated and may potentially be subject to
significant volatility, negatively impacting our capital
ratios. The uncertainty caused by these factors could
ultimately impact our ability to meet our goals,
supervisory requirements and regulatory standards.
The Parent is a non-operating holding company
and, as a result, is dependent on dividends from its
subsidiaries and extensions of credit from its IHC to
meet its obligations, including with respect to its
securities, and to provide funds for share
repurchases, payment of income taxes and payment
of dividends to its stockholders.
The Parent is a non-operating holding company,
whose principal assets and sources of income are its
principal U.S. bank subsidiaries—The Bank of New
York Mellon and BNY Mellon, N.A.—and its other
subsidiaries, including Pershing and the IHC. The
Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its
banks, the IHC and other subsidiaries. Therefore, the
Parent primarily relies on dividends, interest,
distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries,
including extensions of credit from the IHC, to meet
its payment obligations, including with respect to its
securities, and to provide funds for share repurchases,
the payment of income taxes and payment of
common and preferred dividends to its stockholders,
to the extent declared by the Board of Directors.
There are various limitations on the extent to which
our banks and other subsidiaries can finance or
otherwise supply funds to the Parent (by dividend or
otherwise) and certain of our affiliates. Each of these
restrictions can reduce the amount of funds available
to meet the Parent’s obligations. Many of our
subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries, are
subject to laws and regulations that restrict dividend
payments or authorize regulatory bodies to block or
reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to
the Parent or other subsidiaries. In addition, our bank
subsidiaries would not be permitted to distribute a
dividend if doing so would constitute an unsafe and
unsound practice or if the payment would reduce their
capital to an inadequate level. Our subsidiaries may
also choose to restrict dividend payments to the
Parent in order to increase their own capital or
liquidity levels. Our bank subsidiaries are also
subject to restrictions on their ability to lend to or
transact with non-bank affiliates, minimum regulatory
capital and liquidity requirements, and restrictions on
their ability to use funds deposited with them in bank
or brokerage accounts to fund their businesses. See
“Supervision and Regulation” and “Results of
Operations – Liquidity and dividends,” as well as
Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. Further, we evaluate and manage
liquidity on a legal entity basis, which may place
legal and other limitations on our ability to utilize
liquidity from one legal entity to satisfy the liquidity
requirements of another, including the Parent.
Risk Factors (continued)
102 BNY
There are also limitations specific to the IHC’s ability
to make distributions or extend credit to the Parent.
The IHC is not permitted to make distributions to the
Parent if certain key capital and liquidity indicators
are breached, and if the resolution of the Parent is
imminent, the committed lines of credit provided by
the IHC to the Parent will automatically terminate,
with all outstanding amounts becoming due.
Because the Parent is a holding company, its rights
and the rights of its creditors, including the holders of
its securities, to a share of the assets of any subsidiary
upon the liquidation or recapitalization of the
subsidiary, will be subject to the prior claims of the
subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of our
banking subsidiaries, their depositors) except to the
extent that the Parent may itself be a creditor with
recognized claims against the subsidiary. The rights
of holders of securities issued by the Parent to benefit
from those distributions will also be junior to those
prior claims. Consequently, securities issued by the
Parent will be effectively subordinated to all existing
and future liabilities of our subsidiaries.
Our ability to return capital to shareholders is
subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors
and may be limited by U.S. banking laws and
regulations, including those governing capital and
capital planning, applicable provisions of Delaware
law and our failure to pay full and timely dividends
on our preferred stock.
Holders of our common and preferred stock are only
entitled to receive such dividends or other
distributions of capital as our Board of Directors may
declare out of funds legally available for such
payments. Although we have historically declared
cash dividends on our common and preferred stock,
we are not required to do so. In addition to the Board
of Directors’ approval, our ability to take certain
actions, including our ability to declare dividends or
repurchase our common stock, may be subject to the
buffers under the Federal Reserve’s capital and
TLAC rules. The buffers under the capital rules are
affected by the results of CCAR. Through the CCAR
process, we may be, and have in the past been,
required to resubmit our capital plan in the event of a
deterioration in the general financial markets or
economy or changes in our risk profile (including a
material change in business strategy or risk
exposure), financial condition or corporate structure.
The Federal Reserve is also able, outside the CCAR
process, to restrict our ability to make capital
distributions and subject us to other supervisory or
enforcement actions.
A Federal Reserve determination that our capital
planning processes were weak or otherwise fail to
meet supervisory expectations could have a variety of
adverse consequences, including, without limitation,
ratings downgrades, ongoing heightened supervisory
scrutiny, expenses associated with remediation
activities and potentially an enforcement action.
A failure to increase dividends along with our
competitors, or any reduction of, or elimination of,
our common stock dividend would likely adversely
affect the market price of our common stock, our
return on equity and market perceptions of BNY.
Our ability to declare or pay dividends on, or
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our
common stock will be prohibited, subject to certain
exceptions, in the event that we do not declare and
pay in full dividends for the then-current dividend
period (in the case of dividends) or most recently
completed dividend period (in the case of
repurchases) of our Series A preferred stock or the
last preceding dividend period (in the case of
dividends) or most recently completed dividend
period (in the case of repurchases) of our Series F,
Series G, Series H or Series I preferred stock.
In addition, regulatory capital rules that are or will be
applicable to us, including the U.S. capital rules riskbased capital requirements, the SLR, the stress capital
buffer, the enhanced SLR, the TLAC rule and the
U.S. G-SIB surcharge, may limit or otherwise restrict
how we utilize our capital, including common stock
dividends and stock repurchases, and may require us
to increase or alter the mix of our outstanding
regulatory capital instruments. Changes in the
composition of our balance sheet, including as a
result of changing economic conditions and market
values, may further require us to increase or alter the
mix of our outstanding regulatory capital, which in
turn could impact our ability to return capital to
shareholders.
Any requirement to increase our regulatory capital
ratios or alter the composition of our capital could
require us to liquidate assets or otherwise change our
business and/or investment plans, which may
negatively affect our financial results. Further, any
requirement to maintain higher levels of capital may
constrain our ability to return capital to shareholders

either in the form of common stock dividends or
stock repurchases.
Any material reduction in our credit ratings or the
credit ratings of our principal bank subsidiaries,
The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A.
or The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, could
increase the cost of funding and borrowing to us
and our rated subsidiaries and have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations and on the value of the
securities we issue.
Our debt and preferred stock and the debt and
deposits of our principal bank subsidiaries, The Bank
of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A. and The
Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV, are currently
rated investment grade by the major rating agencies.
These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and our
rated subsidiaries. Their credit ratings are based on a
number of factors, including our financial strength,
performance, prospects and operations, as well as
factors not entirely within our control, including
conditions affecting the financial services industry
generally and the U.S. government. Rating agencies
employ different models and formulas to assess the
financial strength of a rated company, and from time
to time rating agencies have, in their discretion,
altered these models. Changes to rating agency
models, general economic conditions, regulatory
developments or other circumstances outside our
control could negatively impact a rating agency’s
judgment of the rating or outlook it assigns to us or
our rated subsidiaries. As a result, we or our rated
subsidiaries may not be able to maintain our
respective credit ratings or outlook on our securities.
For further discussion of our and our principal bank
subsidiaries’ credit ratings, see “Results of Operations
– Liquidity and dividends.”
A material reduction in our credit ratings or the credit
ratings of our rated subsidiaries, which can occur at
any time without notice, could have a material
adverse effect on our access to credit markets, the
related cost of funding and borrowing, our credit
spreads, our liquidity and certain trading revenues,
particularly in those businesses where counterparty
creditworthiness is critical. In addition, in connection
with certain over-the-counter derivatives contracts
and other trading agreements, counterparties may
require us or our rated subsidiaries to provide
additional collateral or to terminate these contracts
and agreements and collateral financing arrangements
in the event of a credit ratings downgrade below
certain ratings levels, which could impair our
liquidity. A downgrade by any one rating agency,
depending on the agency’s relative ratings of the
entity at the time of the downgrade, may have an
impact comparable to the impact of a downgrade by
all rating agencies. If a rating agency downgrade or a
review for downgrade were to occur during broader
market instability, our options for responding to
events may be more limited and more expensive,
possibly significantly. An increase in the costs of our
funding and borrowing, or an impairment of our
liquidity, could have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations and financial condition. A
material reduction in our credit ratings also could
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing or permitted to do business with or lend to us
and adversely affect the value of the securities we
have issued or may issue in the future.
We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may
take, or what actions we may elect or be required to
take in response thereto, which may adversely affect
us. For further discussion on the impact of a credit
rating downgrade, see “Disclosure of contingent
features in OTC derivative instruments” in Note 23 of
the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The application of our Title I preferred resolution
strategy or resolution under the Title II orderly
liquidation authority could adversely affect the
Parent’s liquidity and financial condition and the
Parent’s security holders.
In 2017, in connection with our single point of entry
resolution strategy under Title I of the Dodd-Frank
Act, the Parent entered into a binding support
agreement with certain key subsidiaries to facilitate
the provision of capital and liquidity resources to
them in the event of material financial distress or
failure. The support agreement requires the Parent to
transfer cash and other liquid financial assets to the
IHC on an ongoing basis, subject to certain amounts
retained by the Parent to meet its near-term cash
needs, in exchange for unsecured subordinated
funding notes issued by the IHC as well as a
committed line of credit to the Parent to service its
near-term obligations. The Parent’s and the IHC’s
obligations under the support agreement are secured.
If our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so
severely that resolution of the Parent becomes
imminent, the committed line of credit the IHC
Risk Factors (continued)
104 BNY
provided to the Parent will automatically terminate,
with all amounts outstanding becoming due and
payable, and the support agreement will require the
Parent to transfer most of its remaining assets (other
than stock in subsidiaries and a cash reserve to fund
bankruptcy expenses) to the IHC. As a result, during
a period of severe financial stress, the Parent could
become unable to meet its debt and payment
obligations (including with respect to its securities),
causing the Parent to seek protection under
bankruptcy laws earlier than it otherwise would have.
If the Parent were to become subject to a bankruptcy
proceeding and our single point of entry strategy is
successful, our material entities will not be subject to
insolvency proceedings and their creditors would not
be expected to suffer losses, while the Parent’s
security holders, including unsecured debt holders,
could face significant losses, potentially including the
loss of their entire investment. The single point of
entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the only
legal entity to enter resolution proceedings, may
result in greater risk of loss to holders of the Parent’s
unsecured senior debt securities and certain other
securities than would be the case under a different
resolution strategy.
In addition, Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act
established an orderly liquidation process in the event
of the failure of a large systemically important
financial institution, such as BNY, in order to avoid
or mitigate serious adverse effects on the U.S.
financial system. Specifically, if the Parent is in
default or danger of default and certain specified
conditions are met, the FDIC may be appointed
receiver under the orderly liquidation authority, and
we would be resolved under that authority instead of
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
U.S. supervisors have indicated that a single point of
entry strategy may be a desirable strategy to resolve a
large financial institution such as BNY under Title II
in a manner that would, similar to our preferred
strategy under our Title I resolution plan, impose
losses on shareholders, unsecured debt holders and
other unsecured creditors of the Parent, while
permitting the holding company’s subsidiaries to
continue to operate and remain solvent. Under such a
strategy, assuming the Parent entered resolution
proceedings and its subsidiaries remained solvent,
losses at the subsidiary level would be absorbed by
the Parent and ultimately borne by the Parent’s
security holders (including holders of the Parent’s
unsecured debt securities), while third-party creditors
of the Parent’s subsidiaries would not be expected to
suffer losses. Accordingly, the Parent’s security
holders (including holders of unsecured debt
securities and other unsecured creditors) could face
losses in excess of what otherwise would have been
the case.
Strategic Risk
New lines of business, new products and services or
transformational or strategic project initiatives
subject us to new or additional risks, and the failure
to implement these initiatives could affect our
results of operations.
From time to time, we have launched new lines of
business, offered new products and services within
existing lines of business or undertaken
transformational or strategic projects. There are
substantial risks and uncertainties associated with
these efforts, including with respect to projects that
involve the adoption of new and evolving
technologies such as artificial intelligence. We invest
significant time and resources in developing and
marketing new lines of business, products and
services and executing on our transformational and
strategic initiatives. For example, we have devoted
significant resources to developing new technology
solutions for our clients, including our initiatives
related to real-time electronic payments and global
collateral management, as well as Wove, our
integrative wealth management advisory platform. If
these technology solutions do not operate or perform
as expected, are not successful, or do not produce the
anticipated efficiencies, it could adversely impact our
reputation, business and results of operations.
Developing and providing new products and services,
including those relating to digital assets, increases our
operational risk exposures. These risks are often
heightened for projects that rely on third-party service
providers, or in connection with new technologies
and asset classes, such as digital assets, that are not
only new for BNY but also relatively new to the
financial markets more broadly. Compared with our
activities involving traditional assets, digital assetrelated products or services may introduce
incremental or unique risks, particularly those
associated with cybersecurity exposures and thirdparty dependencies, as well as reputational,
technology, legal and regulatory risks.
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 105
Regulatory requirements can affect whether
initiatives are able to be brought to market in a
manner that is timely and attractive to our customers.
Initial timetables for the development and
introduction of new lines of business or new products
or services and price and profitability targets may not
be met. Furthermore, our revenues and costs may
fluctuate because new businesses or products and
services generally require startup costs while
revenues may take time to develop, which may
adversely impact our results of operations. The
introduction of new accounting or regulatory
requirements, or changes in those requirements, can
also limit our ability to pursue strategic initiatives or
result in significant costs. For example, prior to the
repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, we had
devoted considerable resources in analyzing the
impact of such guidance on our existing and potential
digital asset custody offerings.
Significant effort and resources are necessary to
manage and oversee the successful completion of
transformational or strategic project initiatives. If
management makes choices about these initiatives
that prove to be incorrect, are based on incomplete,
inaccurate or fraudulent information, fail to
accurately assess the competitive landscape and
industry trends or are unable to address the
expectations of various stakeholders, then the value
and growth prospects of our business may be
affected. Further, these initiatives often place
significant demands on management and a limited
number of employees with subject matter expertise
and may involve significant costs to implement, as
well as increase operational risk as we develop and
implement related controls, processes and procedures
and employees learn to operate under new systems,
controls, processes and procedures. The failure to
successfully execute or monitor these
transformational or strategic initiatives could
adversely impact our business, reputation and results
of operations.
Legal, regulatory and reputational risks may also
exist in connection with dealing with new products,
technologies or markets, or clients and customers
whose businesses focus on such products,
technologies or markets, where there is regulatory
uncertainty or different or conflicting regulations
depending on the regulator or the jurisdiction. We
may invest significant time and resources into the
expansion of existing or creation of new compliance
and risk management systems with respect to new
products, technologies or markets.
Our strategic transactions present risks and
uncertainties and could have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
From time to time, to achieve our strategic objectives,
we have acquired, disposed of or invested in
(including through joint venture relationships)
companies and businesses and have entered into
strategic alliances or other collaborations with thirdparty service providers to deliver products and
services to clients, and may do so in the future. Our
ability to pursue or complete strategic transactions is
in certain instances subject to regulatory approval and
we cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and
conditions, any required regulatory approvals would
be granted. Moreover, to the extent we pursue a
strategic transaction, there can be no guarantee that
the transaction will close when anticipated, or at all.
If a strategic transaction does not close (including due
to failure to obtain regulatory approval), or if the
strategic transaction fails to deliver anticipated
results, it could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of
operations. Anticipated challenges in obtaining any
required governmental approvals, or uncertainty as to
the prospects for obtaining such approvals, could also
prevent us from pursuing a strategic transaction we
may otherwise view as attractive.
Each acquisition poses integration challenges,
including successfully retaining and assimilating
clients and key employees, capitalizing on certain
revenue synergies and integrating the acquired
company’s employees, culture, control functions,
systems and technology. These risks may be
heightened if we are unable to, or fail to, conduct
sufficient or appropriate due diligence in connection
with a potential acquisition. In some cases,
acquisitions involve entry into new businesses or new
geographic or other markets, and these situations also
present risks and uncertainties in instances where we
may be inexperienced in these new areas. We may be
required to spend a significant amount of time and
resources to integrate these acquisitions. The
anticipated integration benefits may take longer to
achieve than projected and the time and cost needed
to consolidate control functions, platforms and
systems may significantly exceed our estimates. If
we fail to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions,
Risk Factors (continued)
106 BNY
including doing so in a timely and cost-effective
manner, we may not realize the expected benefits,
which could have an adverse impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, we may incur expenses, costs, losses,
penalties, taxes and other liabilities related to the
conduct of the acquired businesses prior to the date of
our ownership (including in connection with the
defense and/or settlement of legal and regulatory
claims, investigations and proceedings) which may
not be recoverable through insurance, indemnification
or otherwise. If the purchase price we pay in an
acquisition exceeds the fair value of assets acquired
less the liabilities we assume, then we may need to
recognize goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill is an intangible asset that is not eligible for
inclusion in regulatory capital under applicable
requirements. Further, if the value of the acquisition
declines, we may be required to record an impairment
charge.
Each disposition also poses challenges, including
separating the disposed businesses, products and
systems in a way that is cost-effective and is not
disruptive to us or our customers. The inherent
uncertainty involved in the process of evaluating,
negotiating or executing a potential sale of one of our
companies or businesses may cause the loss of key
clients, employees, vendors and other business
partners, which could have an adverse impact on our
business, financial condition and results of
operations. In addition, a portion of the purchase
price we expect to receive in a disposition may be
contingent or based on an earnout (e.g., dependent on
the profitability or results of operation of the business
over a period of time after the sale is completed). In
such cases, we may not realize all, or any, contingent
or earnout payments we anticipate receiving if the
future performance of the business does not meet our
expectations or if other contingent payment
conditions are not satisfied.
Joint ventures, noncontrolling investments, strategic
alliances and other collaborations contain potentially
increased financial, legal, reputational, operational,
regulatory and/or compliance risks. We may be
dependent on joint venture partners, firms with which
we collaborate, controlling shareholders or
management who may have business interests,
strategies or goals that are inconsistent with ours.
Such dependencies, particularly in the case of
establishing de novo joint ventures, may delay the
launch of a new venture and result in the loss of a
market opportunity. Business decisions or other
actions or omissions of the joint venture partner, the
firms with which we collaborate, controlling
shareholders or management may adversely affect the
value of our investment (or, in the case of strategic
alliances or other collaborations, the value of our
products or services), impact our results of
operations, result in litigation or regulatory action
against us and otherwise damage our reputation and
brand.
We may not realize some or all of the expected
benefits of our transition to a platforms operating
model.
We are executing on a plan to transition our
organization to a platforms operating model. We
expect such transition to lead to operating
efficiencies, process simplification, cost savings, an
increased focus on clients and improvements to the
client experience, infrastructure improvements to
technology and other systems, among other benefits.
Implementing these changes to our operating model
involves various execution challenges, complexities
and uncertainties, may be costly and disruptive to our
business, may result in litigation, regulatory scrutiny,
or other negative financial, strategic or reputational
impacts. Projections regarding the benefits of the
transition are based on current business operations,
market conditions and management expectations,
among other factors, and are subject to change. We
may not be able to obtain the anticipated benefits,
cost savings and operational improvements within the
projected timing or at all. Additionally, we may
experience unintended and unforeseen consequences
as a result of such transition, including a loss of
continuity, increased complexity, issues concerning
employee retention, labor disputes, decreased
employee morale, loss of institutional knowledge and
expertise of departing employees. Such unintended
consequences may increase as the pace of
implementation of our platforms operating model
accelerates or if we are unsuccessful in executing
organizational change management. If we are unable
to successfully implement our transition to a
platforms operating model, our business, financial
condition and results of operations could be adversely
affected.
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 107
We are subject to competition in all aspects of our
business, which could negatively affect our ability to
maintain or increase our profitability.
The businesses in which we operate are intensely
competitive around the world. Larger and more
geographically diverse companies, and financial
technology firms that invest substantial resources in
developing and designing new technology and that
are not subject to the same level of regulation, may be
able to offer financial products and services at more
competitive prices than we are able to offer. We have
also experienced, and anticipate that we will continue
to experience, pricing and other competitive pressures
in several of our businesses. Pricing pressures, as a
result of the willingness of competitors to offer
comparable or improved products or services at a
lower price, may result in a reduction in the price we
can charge for our products and services, which
could, and in some cases has, negatively affected our
ability to maintain or increase our profitability.
In addition, technological advances have made it
possible for other types of non-depository
institutions, such as financial technology firms,
outsourcing companies and data processing
companies, to offer a variety of products and services
competitive with certain areas of our business,
including with respect to our clearing, settlement,
payments and trading activities. In the future,
financial technology firms may be able to provide
traditional banking products and services by
obtaining a bank-like charter or offer
cryptocurrencies.
Moreover, new or disruptive technologies may
quickly impact markets and the manner in which our
clients interact and transact within markets. For
example, the emergence, adoption and evolution of
new technologies that do not require intermediation,
including distributed ledgers, as well as advances in
robotic process automation, could significantly affect
the competition for payments processing and other
financial services. Our failure to either anticipate, or
participate in, the transformational change within a
given market or adapt these technologies as
successfully as our peers, could make us less
competitive and result in potential negative financial
impact. Increased competition in any of these areas
may require us to make additional capital investments
in our businesses in order to remain competitive.
Furthermore, regulations could impact our ability to
conduct certain of our businesses in a cost-effective
manner or at all. The more restrictive laws and
regulations applicable to the largest U.S. financial
services institutions, including the U.S. capital rules,
can put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to
both our non-U.S. competitors and U.S. competitors
not subject to the same laws and regulations. See
“Supervision and Regulation.”
Additional Risks
Our businesses may be negatively affected by
adverse events, publicity, government scrutiny or
other reputational harm.
We are subject to reputational, legal, compliance and
regulatory risk in the ordinary course of our business.
Harm to our reputation can result from numerous
sources, including adverse publicity or negative
information, whether or not true, arising from events
occurring at BNY, other financial institutions or in
the financial markets, perceived failure to comply
with legal and regulatory requirements or deliver
appropriate standards of service and quality, or a
failure to appropriately describe our products and
services, how we address environmental, social and
sustainability concerns in our business activities or in
our relationships with clients, the purported
inappropriate or unlawful actions of our employees or
the use of social media by our employees, the
consequences of using emerging technologies, such
as generative artificial intelligence or blockchain
technology, alleged financial reporting irregularities
involving ourselves or other large and well-known
companies and perceived or actual conflicts of
interest. For example, a cybersecurity event
impacting us or our customers’ data could have a
negative impact on our reputation and customer
confidence in BNY and our cybersecurity defenses
and business continuity and resiliency capabilities.
Our reputation could also be harmed by the failure of
an affiliate, joint venture or a vendor or other third
party with which we do business to comply with laws
or regulations. Our reputation may be significantly
damaged by adverse publicity or negative information
regarding BNY, whether or not true, that may be
published or broadcast by the media or posted on
social media, non-mainstream news services or other
internet forums. The speed and pervasiveness with
which information, misinformation or rumors can be
disseminated through these channels, in particular
social media, may magnify risks relating to negative
Risk Factors (continued)
108 BNY
publicity or media scrutiny. Damage to our
reputation could affect the confidence of clients,
rating agencies, regulators, employees, stockholders
and other stakeholders and could in turn have an
impact on our business and results of operations.
Additionally, governmental scrutiny from regulators,
tax authorities, legislative bodies and law
enforcement agencies with respect to financial
services companies has remained at elevated levels.
Press coverage and other public statements, including
information posted on social media or other internet
forums, that allege some form of wrongdoing
(including, in some cases, press coverage and public
statements that do not directly involve BNY) often
result in some type of investigation or in lawsuits.
Certain enforcement authorities have recently
required admissions of wrongdoing, and in some
cases, criminal pleas, as part of the resolution of
matters brought by them against financial institutions.
Any such resolution of a matter involving BNY could
lead to increased exposure to civil litigation, could
adversely affect our reputation and ability to do
business in certain products and in certain
jurisdictions and could have other negative effects.
Impacts from geopolitical events, acts of terrorism,
war, natural disasters, the physical effects of climate
change, pandemics and other similar events may
have a negative impact on our business and
operations.
In conducting our business and maintaining and
supporting our global operations, which includes
clients, counterparties, vendors and other third
parties, we are subject to risks of loss from the
outbreak of war, escalation or continuation of
hostilities, global conflicts, acts of terrorism, natural
disasters, the physical effects of climate change,
pandemics and other similar unpredictable or
catastrophic events that could have a negative impact
on our business and operations. For example, in July
2024, a software update by CrowdStrike Holdings,
Inc. (“CrowdStrike”), a cybersecurity technology
company, caused widespread crashes of the Windows
systems into which it was integrated resulting in
operational disruptions to a variety of sectors
including aviation, financial services and healthcare.
Although we have not experienced any material
impacts as a result of the CrowdStrike software
update or similar events, we could in the future
experience similar third-party software-induced
interruptions to our operations, which could adversely
affect our business, results of operations and financial
condition. We may also be impacted by unfavorable
political, economic, legal or other developments, in
addition to social or political instability, changes in
governmental policies or policies of central banks,
sanctions, expropriation, nationalization, confiscation
of assets, price, capital and exchange controls, the
imposition of tariffs, counter tariffs or other
limitations on international trade and travel, which
could disrupt world trade and lead to trade retaliation
and other supply chain complications, and changes in
laws and regulations. These risks may be heightened
as a result of uncertainties about changing rules,
regulations and policies following the outcome of
recent elections and the resulting political
administration transitions in the United States and
internationally.
For example, as a result of Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine in the first quarter of 2022, we ceased
originating new banking business in Russia and
suspended investment management purchases of
Russian securities. An escalation or continuation of
hostilities, the imposition of additional sanctions or
other laws prohibiting or limiting operations in
certain jurisdictions or an elevated volume and
complexity of cyberattacks as a result of the conflict
in Ukraine, or conflicts or tensions in other regions
such as the Middle East, could lead to unexpected
disruptions to our businesses and could adversely
affect the global economy and financial markets
generally, diminish levels of economic activity and
increase volatility in commodity prices, credit and
capital markets. The extent and duration of any such
military action, and the responses to such action by
governments, central banks and the markets, are
difficult to predict and may magnify the impact of
other risks described in this section.
Our operations, business, clients, supply chain and
other stakeholders, as well as the finance sector and
the global economy, could be adversely affected by
the physical manifestations of climate change.
Climate-related physical risks include the increased
frequency or severity of acute weather events, such as
hurricanes, floods, heatwaves and wildfires, and
chronic shifts in the climate, such as increases in
average global temperatures, rising sea levels,
persistent changes in precipitation levels, prolonged
drought, food and water insecurity, and any resulting
population migration. Such changes could have
adverse financial, operational and other impacts on
us, both directly on our business, operations and
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 109
employees, and indirectly as a result of impacts to our
clients, vendors and other third parties on which we
rely or as a result of market volatility. These risks,
and the impact on our business and the business of
our clients and counterparties, are often difficult to
predict or quantify. Climate change risks can also
lead to a deterioration in our credit risk exposures, for
example, in our wealth management mortgage and
commercial real estate portfolios. Further, our
headquarters is located in New York near the Hudson
River waterfront. Such location and the location of
our other properties may subject us to more frequent
or severe weather events, which could lead to
declines in the asset values of our properties and the
reduced availability or increased cost of insurance.
While we have business continuity and disaster
recovery plans in place, catastrophic events, whether
or not caused by climate change, could damage our
facilities, disrupt or delay for prolonged periods
normal business operations (including
communications, technology and physical access to
our facilities) or result in harm to or cause travel
limitations on our employees, with a similar impact
on our clients, suppliers and counterparties.
Notwithstanding our efforts to maintain business
continuity and disaster recovery plans, to the extent a
catastrophic event occurs and our business continuity
and disaster recovery plans fail or are otherwise
impaired, for example, because of an internal or
external failure of our information technology
infrastructure or increased rates of employee illness
or unavailability, our business continuity status would
be adversely impacted, our ability to service and
interact with our clients may suffer and there would
be a disruption to our businesses.
Catastrophic events, including those caused by
climate change, could also negatively impact the
purchase of our products and services if those events
result in reduced capital markets activity, lower asset
price levels or disruptions in general economic
activity, or in financial market settlement functions,
which could negatively impact our business and
results of operations. In addition, such catastrophic
events may lead, and in some cases have led, to
higher market volatility, reduced availability or
increased cost of insurance for our clients, as well as
an increase in delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults
that could result in our experiencing higher levels of
nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions
for credit losses, negatively impacting our business
and operations. Furthermore, we invest in renewable
energy projects, which have been and may in the
future be adversely affected by extreme weather
events, natural disasters and other catastrophic events.
Sustainability concerns, including a focus on
climate change and diversity, could adversely affect
our business, affect client activity levels, subject us
to additional regulatory requirements and damage
our reputation.
Global efforts to mitigate climate damage, support
climate adaptation, slow the loss of biodiverse natural
ecosystems and promote other sustainability causes
and standards have led and are likely to continue to
lead to new legislative and regulatory requirements,
heightened expectations among regulators and
supervisors, and changes in consumers’ and
businesses’ behaviors and business preferences.
Conversely, there has been increasing sentiment
against climate and diversity initiatives in the U.S.,
which has led and is likely to continue to lead to new
policies and legislative and regulatory requirements
discouraging or prohibiting these initiatives. As a
result, we may face heightened, and potentially
conflicting, regulatory, legal and reputational scrutiny
in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions in which
we operate, and our business and financial condition
may be adversely impacted.
The governmental and supervisory focus on these and
other sustainability-related issues has resulted and
could continue to result in our becoming subject to
new, conflicting or heightened regulatory
requirements or supervisory guidance, such as
requirements relating to risk management, operational
resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress
scenarios, or additional, potentially costly, reporting
requirements. In particular, financial institutions
have come under increased scrutiny regarding the
management and disclosure of climate risks, both
directly and indirectly, and new regulations may
expand required disclosure of actual and potential
climate-related impact on suppliers, clients and other
third parties in our value chain. For example, in
October 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the
FDIC jointly issued interagency guidance for large
financial institutions, including BNY, on principles
for climate-related financial risk management, and
California enacted three climate-related laws
imposing extensive new climate-related disclosure
obligations applicable to companies doing business in
California, and in 2024, made updates to two of those
laws. In 2024, the SEC also adopted rules requiring
Risk Factors (continued)
110 BNY
enhanced disclosures of certain climate-related risks,
which was stayed pending litigation. On the other
hand, certain states in which we operate have enacted,
or have proposed to enact, statutes that prohibit
financial institutions from denying or canceling
products or services to a person, or otherwise
discriminating against a person in making available
products or services, on the basis of social credit
scores and certain other factors. There is also shifting
sentiment in the U.S. against climate, sustainability
and diversity programs and initiatives at the federal
level, with executive orders directing federal agencies
to eliminate programs, grants and mandates that
support diversity, equity, inclusion or environmental
goals. Any changes in regulatory requirements,
including as a result of changes in policies from
federal, state or non-U.S. lawmakers and regulators,
could result in increased regulatory, compliance or
other costs or higher capital requirements, and may
subject us to diverging and evolving requirements in
the various jurisdictions in which we operate,
including potentially conflicting sustainability and
anti-sustainability requirements and expectations
from local, state and national governments that may
impact our ability to conduct certain business within
those jurisdictions.
Our Investment Management line of business offers a
range of solutions and advice for professional and
personal investors to better manage risk-adjusted
returns and, where applicable, achieve their
sustainable investment goals and invest responsibly.
Certain lawmakers and public officials have
suggested that sustainability-related investing
practices may result in violations of antitrust laws and
breaches of fiduciary duty. In addition, we may face
compliance risks presented by regulations that are
intended to address “greenwashing” or
“greenhushing,” including the UK FCA Sustainability
Disclosure Requirements and other regulations that
may be promulgated in the future. We have in the
past been, and may in the future become, subject to
enforcement actions and investigations by the SEC
and other regulators and government officials,
including state Attorneys General, regarding our
sustainability-related investing practices.
Governmental enforcement action could also lead to
civil litigation claims by clients, fund shareholders
and other third parties asserting violations of law or
breaches of fiduciary duties and contractual
obligations.
Further, as some regulators seek to mandate
additional disclosure of sustainability-related
information, our ability to comply with such
requirements and to conduct more robust risk-related
analyses may be hampered by lack of information and
reliable data. Climate data, particularly greenhouse
gas emissions for clients and direct and indirect
counterparties, may be limited in availability, based
on estimated or unverified figures, which may have
been derived from information or factors released by
third-party sources, collected and reported on a lag,
and variable in quality and consistency. Moreover,
the methodologies and standards used to measure and
report such data are still in early stages, rapidly
evolving and subject to change. In addition,
modeling capabilities to analyze climate-related risks
remain incomplete and there can be no assurance that
accurate or effective predictive tools or capabilities
will be developed. These and other factors could
cause results to differ materially from those expressed
in the estimates and beliefs made by third parties and
by us, which could also impact our management of
risk in this area and could result in us amending or
restating our sustainability targets or baselines,
including those related to greenhouse gas emissions,
carbon neutrality, diversion of waste from landfills,
paper neutrality and water consumption.
In the transition to a low carbon economy, changes in
public policy, regulatory environment, stakeholder
preferences, market pressures and advancements in
technology may affect our business practices or result
in additional costs or other adverse consequences to
our business operations. Such changes could affect
whether and on what terms and conditions we will
engage in certain activities or offer certain products
or services. Failure to adequately consider transition
risks in developing and executing on our business
strategy could lead to a loss of market share, lower
revenues, decreased asset values and higher credit
costs, as well as regulatory scrutiny.
Views about sustainability are diverse and changing,
and our business, reputation and ability to attract and
retain clients and employees may be harmed if our
actions are perceived to be ineffective, insufficient or
otherwise inappropriate, or if we are unable to
achieve our stated objectives and commitments.
Moreover, our reputation may be damaged as a result
of our association, whether actual or perceived, with,
among others, certain industries, companies,
individuals or products perceived to be causing or
exacerbating climate change or contributing to other
Risk Factors (continued)
BNY 111
sustainability issues. We are also exposed to
reputational risk resulting from potential allegations
of discrimination against companies in certain
sectors, as well as any decisions we make to continue
to conduct or change our activities in response to
considerations relating to climate change or other
sustainability issues. At the same time, certain
financial institutions have also been subject to
criticism and negative publicity as a result of their
decisions to reduce their involvement in certain
industries or projects perceived to be causing or
exacerbating climate change or contributing to other
sustainability issues. Further, political pressure may
be placed upon governmental clients not to use
certain providers, such as us, if the legislators or
governmental officials in such jurisdictions believe
our positions are not consistent with the views of
such legislators or officials. The continuously
evolving societal and political perspectives on
sustainability make the ultimate impact on us difficult
to predict, identify and monitor and may be
detrimental to us.
Tax law changes or challenges to our tax positions
with respect to historical transactions may adversely
affect our net income, effective tax rate and our
overall results of operations and financial condition.
In the course of our business, we receive inquiries
and challenges from both U.S. and non-U.S. tax
authorities on the amount of taxes we owe. If we are
not successful in defending these inquiries and
challenges, we may be required to adjust the timing
or amount of taxable income or deductions or the
allocation of income among tax jurisdictions, all of
which can require a greater provision for taxes or
otherwise negatively affect earnings. Probabilities
and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and
adjustments to the reserves are made, when
necessary, but the reserves may prove inadequate
because we cannot necessarily accurately predict the
outcome of any challenge, settlement or litigation or
the extent to which it will negatively affect us or our
business. Future tax laws or the expiration of or
changes in existing tax laws, or the interpretation of
those laws worldwide, could also have a material
impact on our business or net income. Our actions
taken in response to, or reliance upon, such changes
in the tax laws may impact our tax position in a
manner that may result in lower earnings. In
addition, upon any change in tax law, we must
recognize the effect of the change on our deferred tax
assets and liabilities. An increase in the U.S. tax rate
would likely result in an increase in our net deferred
tax liabilities and a reduction in our net income in the
period of enactment of the change. In addition,
changes in tax rates or tax law could also impact the
method and amount of capital that we return to
shareholders. See Note 12 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements for further
information.
Changes in accounting standards governing the
preparation of our financial statements and future
events could have a material impact on our reported
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and other financial data.
From time to time, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and bank
regulators change the financial accounting and
reporting standards governing the preparation of our
financial statements or the interpretation of those
standards. These changes are difficult to predict and
can materially impact how we record and report our
financial condition, results of operations, cash flows
and other financial data. In some cases, the FASB,
the SEC and bank regulators may change financial
accounting and reporting standards governing the
preparation of our financial statements or the
interpretation of those standards that may require us
to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively,
potentially resulting in the restatement of our prior
period financial statements and our related
disclosures.
Additionally, our accounting policies and methods are
fundamental to how we record and report our
financial condition and results of operations. The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
based upon assumptions and use judgments and
models about future economic and market conditions,
which affect reported amounts and related disclosures
in our financial statements. Amounts subject to
estimates are items such as the allowance for credit
losses, goodwill and other intangibles and litigation
and regulatory contingencies. Among other effects,
such changes in estimates could result in further
impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and
establishment of allowances for credit losses as well
as litigation and regulatory contingencies. In
performing our annual and interim goodwill
impairment tests, we may use an income approach to
estimate the fair values of each reporting unit.
Estimated cash flows used in the income approach are
Risk Factors (continued)

based on management’s projections. Estimated cash
flows extend far into the future, and, by their nature,
are difficult to estimate over such an extended time
frame. Factors that may significantly affect the cash
flow estimates include, among others, market values
of assets we manage, the level and mix of those
assets, customer behaviors and attrition, operating
margins, changes in revenue growth trends, certain
money market fee waiver practices, cost structures
and technology, regulatory and legislative changes,
specific industry or market sector conditions,
competition and changes in interest rates. In the
future, small changes in the assumptions, such as
changes in the cash flow estimates, discount rate or
long-term growth rate, or a prolonged
macroeconomic downturn may produce a material
non-cash goodwill impairment. If actual or
subsequent events occur that are materially different
than the assumptions, judgments and estimates we
used, our results of operation may be materially and
negatively impacted.

The following accounting guidance issued by FASB
has not yet been adopted as of Dec. 31, 2024.
ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740):
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income
Tax Disclosures, which requires a company to
disclose, on an annual basis, additional disaggregated
information related to the existing disclosures for the
effective income tax rate reconciliation and income
taxes paid.
This ASU is effective on a prospective basis, with a
retrospective option, for annual periods beginning
after Dec. 15, 2024, and interim periods within fiscal
years beginning after Dec. 15, 2025. BNY is
currently evaluating this guidance and the impact on
the income tax disclosures.

Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP
financial measures
BNY has included in this Annual Report certain NonGAAP financial measures on a tangible basis as a
supplement to GAAP information, which exclude
goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax
liabilities. We believe that the return on tangible
common equity – Non-GAAP is additional useful
information for investors because it presents a
measure of those assets that can generate income, and
the tangible book value per common share – NonGAAP is additional useful information because it
presents the level of tangible assets in relation to
shares of common stock outstanding.
BNY included revenue measures excluding notable
items, including a net loss from repositioning the
securities portfolio, the reduction in the fair value of a
contingent consideration receivable and disposal
gains and losses. Expense measures, excluding
notable items, including goodwill impairment, FDIC
special assessment, severance expense and litigation
reserves, are also presented. Litigation reserves
represent accruals for loss contingencies that are both
probable and reasonably estimable, but exclude
standard business-related legal fees. Income before
taxes, net income applicable to common shareholders
of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation,
diluted earnings per share, return on common equity,
return on tangible common equity and pre-tax
operating margin, excluding the notable items
mentioned above, are also provided. These measures
are provided to permit investors to view the financial
measures on a basis consistent with how management
views the businesses.
The presentation of the growth rates of investment
management and performance fees on a constant
currency basis permits investors to assess the
significance of changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. Growth rates on a constant currency basis were
determined by applying the current period foreign
currency exchange rates to the prior period revenue.
We believe that this presentation, as a supplement to
GAAP information, gives investors a clearer picture
of the related revenue results without the variability
caused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.
BNY has also included the adjusted pre-tax operating
margin – Non-GAAP, which is the pre-tax operating
margin for the Investment and Wealth Management
business segment, net of distribution and servicing
expense that was passed to third parties who
distribute or service our managed funds. We believe
that this measure is useful when evaluating the
performance of the Investment and Wealth
Management business segment relative to industry
competitors.
Forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures
From time to time we may present or discuss
forward-looking Non-GAAP financial measures, such
as targets for expenses excluding notable items. We
are unable to provide a reconciliation of forwardlooking Non-GAAP financial measures to the
comparable GAAP financial measures because we are
unable to provide, without unreasonable effort, a
meaningful or accurate estimation of amounts that
would be necessary for the reconciliation due to the
inherent difficulty of quantifying future amounts or
when they may occur. Such unavailable information
could be significant to future results.

impacts of trends on our businesses, regulatory,
technology, market, economic or accounting
developments and the impacts of such developments
on our businesses).
In this report, any other report, any press release or
any written or oral statement that BNY or its
executives may make, words, such as “estimate,”
“forecast,” “project,” “anticipate,” “likely,” “target,”
“expect,” “intend,” “continue,” “seek,” “believe,”
“plan,” “goal,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “may,”
“might,” “will,” “strategy,” “synergies,”
“opportunities,” “trends,” “momentum,” “ambition,”
“aspiration,” “objective,” “aim,” “future,”
“potentially,” “outlook” and words of similar
meaning, may signify forward-looking statements.
These forward-looking statements, and other forwardlooking statements contained in other public
disclosures of BNY, are not guarantees of future
results or occurrences, are inherently uncertain and
are based upon current beliefs and expectations of
future events, many of which are, by their nature,
difficult to predict, outside of our control and subject
to change. By identifying these statements in this
manner, we are alerting investors to the possibility
that our actual results may differ, possibly materially,
from the anticipated results expressed or implied in
these forward-looking statements as a result of a
number of important factors, including those factors
described in “Risk Factors,” such as:
• errors or delays in our operational and transaction
processing, or those of third parties, may
materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and reputation;
• our risk management framework, policies and
processes may not be effective in identifying or
mitigating risk and reducing the potential for
losses and any inadequacy or lapse in our risk
management framework, policies and processes
could expose us to unexpected losses that could
materially adversely affect our results of
operations or financial condition;
• limitations of the models we use to measure,
monitor and manage risk could lead to
unexpected losses and adverse business impacts;
• a communications or technology disruption or
failure within our infrastructure or the
infrastructure of third parties that results in a loss
of information, delays our ability to access
information or impacts our ability to provide
services to our clients may materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations;
• a cybersecurity incident, or a failure in our
computer systems, networks and information, or
those of third parties, could result in the theft,
disclosure, use or alteration of information,
unauthorized access to or loss of information, or
system or network failures. Any such incident or
failure could adversely impact our ability to
conduct our businesses, damage our reputation
and cause losses;
• the development and use of artificial intelligence
present risks and challenges that may adversely
impact our business;
• we are subject to extensive government
rulemaking, policies, regulation and supervision
that impact our operations. Changes to and
introduction of new rules and regulations have
compelled, and in the future may compel, us to
change how we manage our businesses, which
could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of
operations;
• regulatory or enforcement actions or litigation
could materially adversely affect our results of
operations or harm our businesses or reputation;

BNY 123
Management of BNY is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting for BNY, as such term is defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
BNY’s management, including its principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, has assessed
the effectiveness of BNY’s internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In
making this assessment, management used the criteria
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in
Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).
Based upon such assessment, management believes
that, as of December 31, 2024, BNY’s internal
control over financial reporting is effective based
upon those criteria.
KPMG LLP, the independent registered public
accounting firm that audited BNY’s 2024 financial
statements included in this Annual Report under
“Financial Statements” and “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements,” has issued a report with
respect to the effectiveness of BNY’s internal control
over financial reporting. This report begins on page

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation:
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and subsidiaries' (BNY) internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated
Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our
opinion, BNY maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of BNY as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each
of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the
consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 27, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion
on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
BNY’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on BNY’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to BNY in accordance with the U.S. federal
securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material
weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in
the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the
company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
BNY 125
and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,
or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the
policies or procedures may deteriorate.

The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (and its subsidiaries)
134 BNY
Note 1–Summary of significant accounting
and reporting policies
In this Annual Report, references to “our,” “we,”
“us,” “BNY,” the “Company” and similar terms refer
to The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation and its
consolidated subsidiaries. The term “Parent” refers to
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation but not
its subsidiaries.
Nature of operations
BNY is a global leader in providing a broad range of
financial products and services in domestic and
international markets. Through our three principal
business segments, Securities Services, Market and
Wealth Services and Investment and Wealth
Management, we serve institutions, corporations and
high-net-worth individuals. See Note 24 for the
primary products and services of our lines of business
and other information.
Basis of presentation
The accounting and financial reporting policies of
BNY, a global financial services company, conform
to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
(“GAAP”) and prevailing industry practices.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments
necessary for a fair presentation of financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented have been made.
Use of estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates based upon assumptions about future
economic and market conditions which affect
reported amounts and related disclosures in our
financial statements. Our most significant estimates
pertain to our allowance for credit losses, goodwill
and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory
contingencies. Although our current estimates
contemplate current conditions and how we expect
them to change in the future, it is reasonably possible
that actual conditions could be worse than anticipated
in those estimates, which could materially affect our
results of operations and financial condition.
Foreign currency translation
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign
currencies are translated to U.S. dollars at the rate of
exchange on the balance sheet date. Translation gains
and losses on investments in foreign entities with
functional currencies that are not the U.S. dollar are
recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments
in other comprehensive income (“OCI”). Revenue
and expense transactions are translated at the
applicable daily rate or the weighted average monthly
exchange rate when applying the daily rate is not
practical. For transactions that are denominated in a
currency other than the functional currency, the
effects of exchange rate changes are included in
foreign exchange revenue in the income statement.
Acquisitions and divestitures
The income statement and balance sheet include
results of acquired businesses accounted for under the
acquisition method of accounting pursuant to
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805,
Business Combinations, and equity investments from
the dates of acquisition. Contingent purchase
consideration is measured at its fair value and
recorded on the purchase date. Any subsequent
changes in the fair value of a contingent consideration
liability are recorded to other noninterest expense.
Gains or losses on divested business are reflected in
investment and other revenue. For businesses that are
determined to be held-for-sale and the fair value less
costs to sell is less than its carrying value, a loss is
recognized for that difference. Contingent
consideration received is measured at fair value and
recorded at the date of sale. Any subsequent changes
in the fair value of a contingent consideration
receivable are recorded to investment and other
revenue.
Consolidation
We evaluate an entity for possible consolidation in
accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation. We first
determine whether or not we have variable interests
in the entity, which are investments or other interests
that absorb portions of an entity’s expected losses or
receive portions of the entity’s expected returns. Our
variable interests may include decision-maker or
service provider fees, direct and indirect investments
and investments made by related parties, including
related parties under common control. If it is
determined that we do not have a variable interest in
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
BNY 135
the entity, no further analysis is required and the
entity is not consolidated.
If we hold a variable interest in the entity, further
analysis is performed to determine if the entity is a
variable interest entity (“VIE”) or a voting model
entity (“VME”).
We consider the underlying facts and circumstances
of individual entities when assessing whether or not
an entity is a VIE. An entity is determined to be a
VIE if the equity investors:
• do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity
to finance its activities without additional
subordinated financial support; or
• lack one or more of the following characteristics
of a controlling financial interest:
• the power, through voting rights or similar
rights, to direct the activities of an entity that
most significantly impact the entity’s
economic performance;
• the obligation to absorb the expected losses
of the entity; and
• the right to receive the expected residual
returns of the entity.
We reconsider and reassess whether or not we are the
primary beneficiary of a VIE when governing
documents or contractual arrangements are changed
that would reallocate the obligation to absorb
expected losses or receive expected residual returns
between BNY and the other investors. This could
occur when BNY disposes of any portion of its
variable interests in the VIE, when we acquire
additional variable interests in the VIE, when
additional variable interests are issued to other
investors or when other investors liquidate their
variable interest in the VIE.
We consolidate a VIE if it is determined that we have
a controlling financial interest in the entity. We have
a controlling financial interest in a VIE when we have
both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE
that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or
the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could
potentially be significant to that VIE.
For entities that do not meet the definition of a VIE,
the entity is considered a VME. We consolidate these
entities if we can exert control over the financial and
operating policies of an investee, which typically
occurs if we have a 50% or more voting interest in the
entity.
See Note 14 for additional disclosures related to our
variable interests.
Equity method investments
Equity investments of less than a majority but at least
20% ownership or where we are deemed to have
significant influence are accounted for by the equity
method and included in other assets. Earnings on
these investments are reflected as investment services
fees, investment management and performance fees
or investment and other revenue, as appropriate, in
the period earned.
A loss in value of an equity investment that is
determined to be other-than-temporary is recognized
by reducing the carrying value of the equity
investment to its fair value.
Effective in 2024, but applied retrospectively, the
Company’s investments in renewable energy projects
through limited liability companies are accounted for
using the proportional amortization method, when
certain established criteria are met. Previously, these
investments were accounted for as equity method
investments utilizing the hypothetical liquidation at
book value approach. See “Tax credit investments”
below for information on the proportional
amortization method. See Note 2 for additional
information on the impact of adopting the new
accounting guidance for the amount of our renewable
energy investments.
Below are our most significant equity method
investments.

bearing deposits with banks on the balance sheet and
with cash and due from banks when reconciling the
beginning and end-of-period balances on the
consolidated statement of cash flows.
Securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities sold under repurchase agreements
Securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities sold under repurchase agreements are
accounted for as collateralized financings. Generally,
these agreements are recorded at the amounts at
which the securities will be subsequently resold or
repurchased, plus accrued interest.
Securities purchased under resale agreements are
fully collateralized with high-quality liquid securities.
Collateral requirements are monitored and additional
collateral is received or provided, as required. As
such, these transactions carry minimal credit risk and
are generally not allocated an allowance for credit
losses.
Where an enforceable netting agreement exists, resale
and repurchase agreements executed with the same
counterparty and the same maturity date are reported
on a net basis on the balance sheet.
Securities – Debt
Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale,
held-to-maturity or trading securities when they are
purchased. Debt securities are classified as availablefor-sale when we intend to hold them for an indefinite
period of time or when they may be used for tactical
asset/liability purposes and may be sold from time to
time to effectively manage interest rate exposure,
prepayment risk and liquidity needs. Debt securities
are classified as held-to-maturity when we intend and
have the ability to hold them until maturity. Debt
securities are classified as trading when we intend to
resell them.
Available-for-sale securities are measured at fair
value. The difference between fair value and
amortized cost representing unrealized gains or losses
is recorded net of tax as an addition to, or deduction
from, OCI, unless an expected credit loss is
recognized. Realized gains and losses on sales of
available-for-sale securities are reported in
investment and other revenue on the income
statement. The cost of debt securities sold is
determined on a specific identification method. Heldto-maturity securities are measured at amortized cost,
net of expected credit loss, if any.
From time to time our intention to hold available-forsale securities has changed such that we intend, and
have the ability, to hold the securities to maturity.
Transfers of securities from available-for-sale to heldto-maturity are accounted for at fair value and create
a new cost basis. The unrealized gains or losses at
date of transfer continue to be recorded in
accumulated OCI and are subsequently amortized
into net interest income over the contractual lives of
the securities.
The Company’s policy for recognition of expected
credit losses for securities available-for-sale and
securities held-to-maturity is contained within
“Allowance for credit losses – Securities – Debt” and
“Allowance for credit losses – Other” below.
Trading securities are measured at fair value and
included in trading assets on the balance sheet.
Trading revenue, which is reflected in investment and
other revenue, includes both realized and unrealized
gains and losses. The liability incurred on short-sale
transactions, representing the obligation to deliver
securities, is included in trading liabilities at fair
value.
Income on securities purchased is adjusted for
amortization of premium and accretion of discount on
a level yield basis, generally over their contractual
life.
Debt securities that are beneficial interests in
securitized financial assets and are not high credit
quality are discounted at the current yield used to
accrete the beneficial interest. A credit loss is
recognized when there is an adverse change in
expected cash flows.
If we intend to sell a debt security or it is more likely
than not that we will be required to sell a debt
security prior to recovery of its cost basis, the security
is written down to fair value and the credit and noncredit components of the unrealized loss are
recognized in earnings and subsequently accreted to
interest income on an effective yield basis over the
life of the security. Subsequent increases in the fair
value of the security after the write-down are
included in OCI.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 137
Securities – Equity
Investments in equity securities that do not result in
consolidation and are not accounted for under the
equity method are measured at fair value with
changes in the fair value recognized through earnings,
unless one of two available exceptions applies. The
first exception, a scope exception, allows Federal
Reserve Bank stock, Federal Home Loan Bank stock
and exchange memberships to remain accounted for
at cost, less impairment. The second practicability
exception is an election available for equity
investments that do not have readily determinable fair
values. For certain investments where the Company
has chosen the practicability exception, such
investments are accounted for in other assets on the
balance sheet at cost adjusted for impairment, if any,
plus or minus observable price changes in orderly
transactions for an identical or similar investment of
the same issuer with any such changes reflected in
investment and other revenue. Equity securities with
readily determinable fair values are classified in
trading assets with changes in fair value reflected in
other trading revenue, which is included in
investment and other revenue in the consolidated
income statement.
Loans
Loans are reported at amortized cost, net of any
unearned income and deferred fees and costs. Certain
loan origination and upfront commitment fees, as
well as certain direct loan origination and
commitment costs, are deferred and amortized as a
yield adjustment over the lives of the related loans.
Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or
fair value.
Loan modifications
A loan may be modified if the debtor is experiencing
financial difficulties and the modification results in
more than an insignificant delay in payment. A
determination of whether a debtor is experiencing
financial difficulty is based on payment status, and
for commercial borrowers, the determination also
considers debtor risk ratings. The determination of
whether the modification results in more than an
insignificant delay in payment is based on analysis of
the payment amount subject to delay, the time span of
the modified terms, as well as a review of
modification activity in the previous 12-month
period.
Credit losses related to modified loans are generally
accounted for under an individual evaluation
methodology (see “Allowance for credit losses”
below).
Nonperforming assets
Commercial loans are placed on nonaccrual status
when principal or interest is past due 90 days or more,
or when there is reasonable doubt that interest or
principal will be collected.
When a first or second lien residential mortgage loan
reaches 90 days delinquent, it is subject to an
individual evaluation of credit loss and placed on
nonaccrual status.
When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status,
previously accrued and uncollected interest is
reversed against current period interest income.
Interest receipts on nonaccrual loans are recognized
as interest income or are applied to principal when we
believe the ultimate collectability of principal is in
doubt. Nonaccrual loans generally are restored to an
accrual basis when principal and interest become
current and remain current for a specified period.
“Allowance for credit losses” below provides
additional information regarding the individual
evaluation of credit losses for nonperforming loans.
Allowance for credit losses
The accounting policy for determining the allowances
has been identified as a “critical accounting estimate”
as it requires us to make numerous complex and
subjective estimates and assumptions relating to
amounts which are judgmental and inherently
uncertain.
The allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the expected contractual life of the financial
instruments as of the balance sheet date. The
allowance methodology is designed to provide
procedural discipline in assessing the appropriateness
of the allowance.
A quantitative methodology and qualitative
framework is used to estimate the allowance for
credit losses. The qualitative framework is described
in further detail within “Allowance for credit losses –
Other” below. The quantitative component of our
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
138 BNY
estimate uses models and methodologies that
categorize financial assets based on product type,
collateral type, and other credit trends and risk
characteristics, including relevant information about
past events, current conditions and reasonable and
supportable forecasts of future economic conditions
that affect the collectability of the recorded amounts.
The allowance may be determined using various
methods, including discounted cash flow methods,
loss-rate methods, probability of default methods or
other methods that we determine to be appropriate.
We estimate our expected credit losses using the
probability of default method for the majority of our
financial assets. We measure expected credit losses
of financial assets on a collective (pool) basis when
similar risk characteristics exist. For a financial asset
that does not share risk characteristics with other
assets, expected credit losses are measured based on
an individual evaluation method.
In our estimate, with the exception of our small home
equity line of credit portfolio, available-for-sale debt
securities, and individually evaluated financial assets,
we utilize a multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast
which includes a weighting of three scenarios: a
baseline and upside and downside scenarios and
allows us to develop our estimate using a wide span
of economic variables. Our baseline scenario reflects
a view on likely performance of each global region
and the other two scenarios are designed relative to
the baseline scenario. This approach incorporates a
reasonable and supportable forecast period spanning
the life of the asset, and this period includes both an
initial estimated economic outlook component as well
as a reversion component for each economic input
variable. The length of each of the two components
depends on the underlying financial instrument,
scenario and underlying economic input variable. In
general, the initial economic outlook period for each
economic input variable under each scenario ranges
between several months and two years. The speed at
which the scenario-specific forecasts revert to longterm historical mean is based on observed historical
patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable
input level that are reflected in our model parameter
estimates. Certain macroeconomic variables such as
unemployment or home prices take longer to revert
after a contraction, though specific recovery times are
scenario-specific. Reversion will usually take longer
the further away the scenario-specific forecast is from
the historical mean. On a quarterly basis, within a
developed governance structure, we update these
scenarios for current economic conditions and may
adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic
outlook.
Allowance for credit losses – Loans and lendingrelated commitments
The allowance for credit losses on loans is presented
as a valuation allowance to loans, and the allowance
for credit losses on lending-related commitments is
recorded in other liabilities. The components of the
allowance for credit losses on loans and lendingrelated commitments consist of the following three
elements:
• a pooled allowance component for higher riskrated and pass-rated commercial and institutional
credits and loans secured by commercial real
estate;
• a pooled allowance component for residential
mortgage loans; and
• an asset-specific allowance component involving
individually evaluated credits of $1 million or
greater which no longer share risk characteristics
with other loans.
The first element, a pooled allowance component for
higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and
institutional credits and loans secured by commercial
real estate, is based on our expected credit loss model
using the probability of default method, which has
been adjusted for the forecast of economic conditions.
Individual credit analyses are performed on such
loans before being assigned a credit rating.
Segmentation is established based on risk
characteristics of the loans and how risk is monitored.
In estimating the terms of the exposures and resulting
effect on the measurement of expected credit loss, we
consider the impact of potential prepayments as well
as the effect of borrower extension options. Borrower
ratings are reviewed at least annually and are mapped
to third-party databases, including rating agency and
default and recovery databases, to support ongoing
consistency and validity. Higher risk-rated loans and
lending-related commitments are reviewed quarterly.
For the higher-risk rated and pass-rated commercial
and institutional credits, the loss expected in each
loan incorporates the borrower’s credit rating, facility
rating and maturity. The loss given default, derived
from the facility rating, incorporates a recovery
expectation, and for unfunded lending exposures, an
estimate of the use of the facility at default (usage
given default). The borrower’s probability of default
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 139
is derived from the associated credit rating. The
probability of default and the loss given default are
applied to the estimated facility amount at default to
determine the quantitative component of the
allowance. For each of the different parameters,
specific credit models are developed for each segment
of our portfolio, including commercial loans and
lease financing, financial institutions and other. We
use both internal and external data in the development
of these parameters.
For loans secured by commercial real estate, a
separate modeled approach is used that considers
collateral specific data and loan maturity, as well as
commercial real estate market factors by geographical
region and property type under different
macroeconomic scenarios. A statistical method is
used to simulate the property value and income of
each property, and to estimate the probability of
default, loss given default and expected credit loss for
each loan. The model outputs are established by
using a baseline, upside and downside
macroeconomic scenario to generate projected
property values and incomes.
The second element, a pooled allowance component
for residential mortgage loans, is determined by first
segregating our mortgage pools into two categories:
(i) our wealth management mortgages and other
residential mortgages purchased primarily in 2023
and (ii) our legacy mortgage portfolio disclosed as
other residential mortgages. We then apply models to
each portfolio to predict prepayments, default rates
and loss severity. We consider historical loss
experience and use a loan-level, multi-period default
model which further segments each portfolio by
product type, including first lien fixed rate mortgages,
first lien adjustable rate mortgages, second lien
mortgages and interest-only mortgages. We calculate
the mortgage loss up to loan contractual maturity and
embed a reasonable and supportable forecast and
macroeconomic variable inputs which are described
above. For home equity lines of credit, probability of
default and loss given default are based on external
data from third-party databases due to the small size
of the portfolio and limited internal data. Our legacy
mortgage portfolio and home equity line of credit
portfolios represent small sub-segments of our
mortgage loans.
The third element, individually evaluated credits, is
based on individual analysis of loans of $1 million
and greater which no longer share risk characteristics
with other loans. Factors we consider in measuring
the extent of expected credit loss include the payment
status, collateral value, the borrower’s financial
condition, guarantor support, the probability of
collecting scheduled principal and interest payments
when due, modifications of payment structure or term
for troubled borrowers, and recoveries if they can be
reasonably estimated. We measure the expected
credit loss as the difference between the amortized
cost basis of the loan and the present value of the
expected future cash flows from the borrower which
is generally discounted at the loan’s effective interest
rate, or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is
collateral dependent. We generally individually
evaluate nonperforming loans as well as loans that
have been modified given the risk characteristics of
such loans.
Allowance for credit losses – Securities – Debt
When estimating expected credit losses, we segment
our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity debt
securities portfolios by major asset class. This is
influenced by whether the security is structured or
non-structured (i.e., direct obligation), as well as the
issuer type.
For available-for-sale debt securities with an
unrealized loss at the balance sheet date, if we
determine that a credit loss exists, the amount is
recognized as an allowance for credit losses in
securities – available-for-sale, with a corresponding
adjustment to the provision for credit losses. We
evaluate credit losses at the individual security level
and do not recognize credit losses if the fair value
exceeds amortized cost, and if we determine that a
credit loss exists, we limit the recognition of the loss
to the difference between fair value and amortized
cost. In our determination of whether an expected
credit loss exists for a non-structured security, we
routinely conduct periodic reviews and examine
various quantitative and qualitative factors that are
unique to each portfolio, including the severity of the
unrealized loss position, agency rating, credit
enhancement, cash flow deterioration and other
factors. For a structured security, a credit loss model
is utilized and the components of the credit loss
calculation for each major portfolio or asset class
include a probability of default and loss given default
(severity). These values depend on forecasted
behavior of variables in the macroeconomic
environment that are incorporated into our baseline
forecast scenario described in “Allowance for credit
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
140 BNY
losses” above. Generally, cash flows are discounted
at the effective interest rate implicit in the debt
security. Changes to the present value of cash flows
due to the passage of time are recognized within the
allowance for credit losses.
We estimate expected credit losses for held-tomaturity debt securities using a similar multi-scenario
macroeconomic forecast methodology as described in
“Allowance for credit losses” above. The allowance
for credit losses on held-to-maturity debt securities is
recorded in securities – held-to-maturity. The
components of the modeled credit loss calculation for
each major portfolio or asset class include a
probability of default and loss given default and their
values depend on the forecast behavior of variables in
the macroeconomic environment. For structured debt
securities, we estimated expected credit losses at the
individual security level and use a cash flow model to
project principal losses. Generally, cash flows are
discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the
debt security. The difference is reflected in the
allowance for credit losses, and changes to the present
value of cash flows due to the passage of time are
recognized within the allowance for credit losses.
We currently do not require an estimate of expected
credit losses to be measured and recorded for U.S.
Treasury securities, agency debt securities, and other
debt securities that meet certain conditions that are
based on a combination of factors such as guarantees,
credit ratings and other credit quality factors. These
assets are monitored within our established
governance structure on a recurring basis to
determine if any changes are warranted.
Allowance for credit losses – Other financial
instruments
We also estimate expected credit losses associated
with margin loans, reverse repurchase agreements,
security lending indemnifications, and deposits with
third-party financial institutions using a similar risk
rating-based modeling approach as described in the
first allowance element within “Allowance for credit
losses – Loans and lending-related commitments”
above. The allowance for credit losses on reverse
repurchase agreements is recorded in federal funds
sold and securities purchased under resale
agreements; the allowance for credit losses on
securities lending indemnifications is recorded in
other liabilities and the allowance for credit losses on
deposits with third-party financial institutions is
recorded in cash and due from banks or interestbearing deposits with banks. Our reverse repurchase
agreements are short term and subject to continuous
over-collateralization by our counterparties and
timely collateral replenishment, when necessary. As
a result, we estimate the expected credit loss related
to the uncollateralized portion of the asset at the
balance sheet date, if any, and when there is a
reasonable expectation that the counterparty will not
replenish the collateral in compliance with the terms
of the repurchase agreement. This method is also
applied to margin lending arrangements and securities
lending indemnifications.
Allowance for credit losses – Other
We do not apply our credit loss measurement
methodologies to accrued interest receivable balances
related to our loan, debt securities and deposits with
third-party financial institution assets given our
nonaccrual policy that requires charge-off of interest
receivable when deemed uncollectible. Accrued
interest receivable related to these instruments, along
with other interest-bearing instruments, is included on
the consolidated balance sheet. Accrued interest
receivable related to each major loan class is
disclosed in our credit quality disclosure in Note 5.
Our policy for credit losses related to purchased
financial assets requires an evaluation to be
performed prior to the effective purchase date to
determine if more than an insignificant decline in
credit quality has occurred during the period between
the origination and purchase date, or, in the case of
debt securities, the period between the issuance and
purchase date. If we purchase a financial asset with
more than insignificant deterioration in credit quality,
the measurement of expected credit loss is performed
using the methodologies described above, and the
credit loss is recorded as an allowance for credit
losses on the purchase date. Subsequent to purchase,
changes (favorable and unfavorable) in expected cash
flows are recognized immediately in net income by
adjusting the allowance. We evaluate various factors
in the determination of whether a more than an
insignificant decline in credit quality has occurred
and these factors vary depending upon the type of
asset purchased. Such factors include changes in risk
rating and/or agency rating, collateral deterioration,
payment status, purchase price, credit spreads and
other factors. We did not purchase any such assets in
2024 or 2023 and did not own such assets as of Dec.
31, 2024 or Dec. 31, 2023.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 141
We apply a separate credit loss methodology to
accounts receivables to estimate the expected credit
losses associated with these short-term receivables
which historically have not resulted in significant
credit losses. The allowance for credit losses on
accounts receivables is reflected in other assets.
The qualitative component of our estimate for the
allowance for credit losses is intended to capture
expected losses that may not have been fully captured
in the quantitative component. Through an
established governance structure, management
determines the qualitative allowance each period
based on an evaluation of various internal and
environmental factors that include: scenario
weighting and sensitivity risk, credit concentration
risk, economic conditions and other considerations.
We may also make adjustments for idiosyncratic
risks. Once determined in the aggregate, our
qualitative allowance is then allocated to each of our
financial instrument portfolios except for debt
securities and those instruments carried in other assets
based on the respective instruments’ quantitative
allowance balances. The allocation of this additional
allowance for credit losses is inherently judgmental,
and the entire allowance for credit losses is available
to absorb credit losses regardless of the nature of the
loss.
The credit quality of our financial assets is assessed
on an ongoing basis. Write-offs of financial assets,
which may be full or partial, are deducted from the
allowance for credit losses and are recorded in the
period in which the financial asset(s) are deemed
uncollectible.
Premises and equipment
Premises and equipment are carried at cost less
accumulated depreciation and amortization.
Depreciation and amortization is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful life of
the owned asset and, for leasehold improvements,
over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased
facility or the estimated economic life of the
improvement. For owned and capitalized assets,
estimated useful lives range from two to 40 years.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred, while major improvements are capitalized
and amortized to operating expense over their
identified useful lives.
Leasing
We determine if an arrangement is a lease at
inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our
right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and
lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease
payments. The ROU assets and lease liabilities are
recognized based on the present value of the future
minimum lease payments over the lease term at
commencement date or at lease modification date for
certain lease modifications. For all leases, we use a
discount rate that represents a collateralized
borrowing rate based on similar terms and
information available at lease commencement date or
at the modification date for certain lease
modifications in determining the present value of
lease payments. In addition to the lease payments,
the determination of an ROU asset may also include
certain adjustments related to lease incentives and
initial direct costs incurred. Options to extend or
terminate a lease are included in the determination of
the ROU asset and lease liability only when it is
reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.
Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the lease term, while the lease
expense for finance leases is recognized using the
effective interest method. ROU assets are reviewed
for impairment when events or circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For
operating leases, if deemed impaired, the ROU asset
is written down and the remaining balance is
subsequently amortized on a straight-line basis which
results in lease expense recognition that is similar to
finance leases.
For all leases, we have elected to account for the
contractual lease and non-lease components as a
single lease component and include them in the
calculation of the lease liability. The non-lease
variable components, such as maintenance expense
and other variable costs, including non-index or rate
escalations, have been excluded from the calculation
and disclosed separately. Additionally, for certain
equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to
account for the operating lease ROU assets and
liabilities.
For subleasing activities, the rental income is reported
as part of net occupancy expense, as this activity is
not a significant business activity and is part of the
Company’s customary business practice.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
142 BNY
For direct finance leases, unearned revenue is
accreted over the lives of the leases in decreasing
amounts to provide a constant rate of return on the net
investment in the leases. We have leveraged lease
transactions that were entered into prior to Dec. 31,
2018. These leases are grandfathered under ASC
842, Leases, which became effective Jan. 1, 2019,
and will continue to be accounted for under the prior
guidance unless the leases are subsequently modified.
Revenue on leveraged leases is recognized on a basis
to achieve a constant yield on the outstanding
investment in the lease, net of the related deferred tax
liability, in the years in which the net investment is
positive. Gains and losses on residual values of
leased equipment sold are included in investment and
other revenue. Impairment of leveraged lease
residual values that is deemed other-than-temporary
is reflected in net interest income. Considering the
nature of these leases and the number of significant
assumptions, there is risk associated with the income
recognition on these leases should any of the
assumptions change materially in future periods.
Software
We capitalize costs relating to acquired software and
internal-use software development projects that
provide new or significantly improved functionality.
We capitalize projects that are expected to result in
longer-term operational benefits, such as replacement
systems or new applications that result in
significantly increased operational efficiencies or
functionality. All other costs incurred in connection
with an internal-use software project are expensed as
incurred. Capitalized software is recorded in other
assets on the balance sheet. We record amortization
of capitalized software in software and equipment
expense on the income statement.
Identified intangible assets and goodwill
Identified intangible assets with estimable lives are
amortized in a pattern consistent with the assets’
identifiable cash flows or using a straight-line method
over their remaining estimated benefit periods if the
pattern of cash flows is not estimable. Intangible
assets with estimable lives are reviewed for possible
impairment when events or changed circumstances
may affect the underlying basis of the asset.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are not
amortized, but are assessed annually for impairment,
or more often if events and circumstances indicate it
is more likely than not they may be impaired and to
determine if the lives are no longer indefinite and
should be amortized. The amount of goodwill
impairment, if any, is determined by the excess of the
carrying value of the reporting unit over its fair value.
The accounting policy for valuing and impairment
testing of identified intangible assets and goodwill
has been identified as a “critical accounting estimate”
as it requires us to make numerous complex and
subjective estimates.
Tax credit investments
Investments in renewable energy projects and
investments in qualified affordable housing projects
through a limited liability entity are accounted for
utilizing the proportional amortization method.
Under the proportional amortization method, the
initial cost of the investment is amortized to the
provision for income taxes in proportion to the tax
credits and other tax benefits received. The net
investment performance, including tax credits and
other benefits received, is recognized in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes. Additionally, the value of the commitments to
fund renewable energy projects and qualified
affordable housing projects is included in other assets
on the balance sheet and a liability is recorded for the
unfunded portion.
Seed capital
Seed capital investments are generally classified as
other assets and carried at fair value unless we are
required to consolidate the investee due to having a
controlling financial interest. Unrealized gains and
losses on seed capital investments are recorded in
investment and other revenue.
Noncontrolling interests
Noncontrolling interests represent the portion of
consolidated entities that are owned by parties other
than BNY. Noncontrolling interests included in
permanent equity are adjusted for the income or loss
attributable to the noncontrolling interest holders and
any distributions to those shareholders. Redeemable
noncontrolling interests are reported as temporary
equity and represent the redemption value resulting
from equity-classified share-based payment
arrangements that are currently redeemable or are
expected to become redeemable. We recognize
changes in the redemption value of the redeemable
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 143
noncontrolling interests as they occur and adjust the
carrying value to be equal to the redemption value.
Fee revenue
Investment services fee revenue and investment
management and performance fee revenue are based
on terms specified in a contract with a customer and
are shown net of fee waivers and exclude any
amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue
is recognized when, or as, a performance obligation is
satisfied by transferring control of a good or service
to a customer. A performance obligation may be
satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue
from a performance obligation satisfied over time is
recognized by measuring our progress in satisfying
the performance obligation in a manner that reflects
the transfer of goods and services to the customer.
Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a
point in time is recognized at the point in time the
customer obtains control of the promised good or
service. The amount of revenue recognized reflects
the consideration we expect to be entitled to in
exchange for the promised goods and services. Taxes
assessed by a governmental authority, that are both
imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenueproducing transaction, are collected from a customer
and are excluded from revenue.
Performance fees are recognized in the period in
which the performance fees are earned and become
determinable. Performance fees are constrained until
all uncertainties are resolved and reversal of
previously recorded amounts is not probable.
Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of the applicable portfolio’s performance
in excess of a benchmark index or a peer group’s
performance. When a portfolio underperforms its
benchmark or fails to generate positive performance,
subsequent years’ performance must generally exceed
this shortfall prior to fees being earned. Amounts
billable, which are subject to a clawback if future
performance thresholds in current or future years are
not met, are not recognized since the fees are
potentially uncollectible. These fees are recognized
when it is determined that they will be collected.
When a multi-year performance contract provides
that fees earned are billed ratably over the
performance period, only the portion of the fees
earned that are non-refundable are recognized.
Additionally, we recognize revenue from nonrefundable, implementation fees under outsourcing
contracts using a straight-line method, commencing
in the period the ongoing services are performed
through the expected term of the contractual
relationship. Incremental direct set-up costs of
implementation, up to the related customer margin or
minimum fee revenue amount, are deferred and
amortized over the same period that the related
implementation fees are recognized. If a client
terminates an outsourcing contract prematurely, the
unamortized deferred incremental direct set-up costs
and the unamortized deferred implementation fees
related to that contract are recognized in the period
the contract is terminated.
We record foreign exchange revenue, financingrelated fees and other revenue when the services are
provided and earned based on contractual terms,
when amounts are determined and collectability is
reasonably assured.
Net interest income
Revenue on interest-earning assets and expense on
interest-bearing liabilities are recognized based on the
effective yield of the related financial instrument.
The amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts are included in interest income and are
adjusted for prepayments when they occur, such that
the effective yield remains constant throughout the
contractual life of the security. Negative interest
incurred on assets or charged on liabilities is
presented as contra interest income and contra interest
expense, respectively.
Pension
The measurement date for BNY’s pension plans is
December 31. Plan assets are determined based on
fair value generally representing observable market
prices. The projected benefit obligation is determined
based on the present value of projected benefit
distributions at an assumed discount rate. The
discount rate utilized is based on the yield curves of
high-quality corporate bonds available in the
marketplace. The net periodic pension expense or
credit includes service costs (if applicable), interest
costs based on an assumed discount rate, an expected
return on plan assets based on an actuarially derived
market-related value, amortization of prior service
cost and amortization of prior years’ actuarial gains
and losses.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
144 BNY
Actuarial gains and losses include gains or losses
related to changes in the amount of the projected
benefit obligation or plan assets resulting from
demographic or investment experience different than
assumed, changes in the discount rate or other
assumptions. To the extent an actuarial gain or loss
exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit
obligation or the market-related value of plan assets,
the excess is generally recognized over the future
service periods of active employees. Benefit accruals
under the U.S. pension plans and the largest foreign
pension plan in the UK are frozen. Future
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses for these
frozen plans that exceed a threshold amount are
amortized over the average future life expectancy of
plan participants with a maximum of 15 years.
Our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
is based on anticipated returns for each applicable
asset class. Anticipated returns are weighted for the
expected allocation for each asset class and are based
on forecasts for prospective returns in the equity and
fixed-income markets, which should track the longterm historical returns for these markets. We also
consider the growth outlook for U.S. and global
economies, as well as current and prospective interest
rates.
The market-related value utilized to determine the
expected return on plan assets is based on the fair
value of plan assets adjusted for the difference
between expected returns and actual performance of
plan assets. The difference between actual
experience and expected returns on plan assets is
included as an adjustment in the market-related value
over a five-year period.
Stock-based compensation
Compensation expense relating to share-based
payments is generally recognized in staff expense on
the income statement, on a straight-line basis, over
the applicable vesting period.
Certain stock compensation grants vest when the
employee retires. New grants with this feature are
expensed by the first date the employee is eligible to
retire. We estimate forfeitures when recording
compensation cost related to share-based payment
awards.
A portion of performance share unit awards are
granted with performance conditions and for which
the ultimate payout is subject to the discretion of the
Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
These awards are classified as equity and marked-tomarket to earnings over the vesting period due to this
discretion. A portion of performance share unit
awards contain market conditions. The grant date fair
value of this portion of the awards is recognized on a
straight-line-basis to staff expense unless the requisite
service period is not rendered.
Severance
BNY provides separation benefits to eligible U.S.-
based employees separated from their jobs for
business reasons not related to individual
performance. Basic separation benefits are generally
based on the employee’s years of continuous
benefited service. Severance expense for employees
based outside of the U.S. is determined in accordance
with local agreements and legal requirements.
Severance expense is recorded when management
commits to an action that will result in separation and
the amount of the liability can be reasonably
estimated.
Income taxes
We record current tax liabilities or assets through
charges or credits to the current tax provision for the
estimated taxes payable or refundable for the current
year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded
for future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income
in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. A deferred tax
valuation allowance is established if it is more likely
than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. A tax position that fails to meet
a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold will
result in either reduction of current or deferred tax
assets, and/or recording of current or deferred tax
liabilities. Interest and penalties related to income
taxes are recorded as income tax expense.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair
value and include futures, forwards, interest rate
swaps, foreign currency swaps, options and similar
products. Derivatives in an unrealized gain position
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 145
are recognized as assets while derivatives in an
unrealized loss position are recognized as liabilities.
Derivatives are reported net by counterparty and after
consideration of cash collateral, to the extent subject
to legally enforceable netting agreements.
Derivatives designated and effective in qualifying
hedging relationships are classified in other assets or
other liabilities on the balance sheet. All other
derivatives are classified within trading assets or
trading liabilities on the balance sheet. Gains and
losses on trading derivatives are generally included in
foreign exchange revenue or investment and other
revenue, as applicable.
We enter into various derivative financial instruments
for non-trading purposes primarily as part of our
asset/liability management process. These nontrading derivatives are designated as one of three
types of hedge activities: fair value, cash flow or net
investment hedges.
To qualify for hedge accounting, each hedge
relationship is required to be highly effective at
reducing the risk associated with the exposure being
hedged, both prospectively and retrospectively. We
formally document all relationships, including
hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our
risk management objectives and strategy for
undertaking each hedging transaction. At inception,
the potential cause of ineffectiveness related to each
of our hedges is assessed to determine if we can
expect the hedge to be highly effective over the life of
the hedging relationship. At hedge inception, we
document the methodology to be utilized for
evaluating effectiveness on an ongoing basis, and we
monitor ongoing hedge effectiveness at least
quarterly.
For qualifying fair value hedges, changes in the fair
value of the derivative, and changes in the value of
the hedged item associated with the designated risks
being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain
amounts excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in
earnings through an amortization approach over the
life of the derivative. We discontinue hedge
accounting prospectively when we determine that the
hedge is no longer effective or the derivative expires,
is sold, or management discontinues the derivative’s
hedge designation. Subsequent gains and losses on
these derivatives are included in foreign exchange
revenue or other trading revenue, as applicable. For
discontinued fair value hedges, the accumulated gain
or loss on the hedged item is amortized on a yield
basis over the remaining life of the hedged item.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the fair
value of the derivative are recorded in OCI, until
reclassified into earnings in the same period the
hedged item impacts earnings. If the hedge
relationship is terminated, then the change in value
will be reclassified from OCI to earnings when the
cash flows that were previously hedged affect
earnings. If cash flow hedge accounting is
discontinued as a result of a forecasted transaction no
longer being probable to occur, then the amount
reported in OCI is immediately reclassified to current
earnings.
Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized
in the same income statement line as the hedged item
affects earnings, principally interest income, interest
expense, foreign exchange revenue and staff expense.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related
to qualifying hedges of net investments in a foreign
operation are recorded with cumulative foreign
currency translation adjustments within OCI net of
their tax effect. We evaluate the effectiveness of
foreign currency derivatives designated as hedges of
net investments utilizing the forward rate method.
Earnings per common share
Basic earnings per common share is calculated by
dividing net income allocated to common
shareholders of BNY by the weighted average
common shares outstanding and vested stock-based
compensation awards where recipients have satisfied
either the explicit vesting terms or retirementeligibility requirements.
Diluted earnings per common share is computed
under the treasury stock method by dividing net
income allocated to common shareholders of BNY by
the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding for the period plus the shares representing
the dilutive effect of equity-based awards.
Prior to 2024, we had stock-based awards that were
considered participating securities. As a result,
earnings per common share was calculated using the
two-class method under which earnings are allocated
to common shareholders and holders of participating
securities. Unvested stock-based compensation
awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
146 BNY
dividends or dividend equivalents are considered
participating securities under the two-class method.
Under the two-class method, we increased the
average number of shares of common stock
outstanding by the assumed number of shares of
common stock that would be issued assuming the
exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares
related to stock-based compensation awards using the
treasury stock method, if dilutive. Diluted earnings
per share was calculated by dividing net income
allocated to common shareholders of BNY by the
adjusted average number of common shares
outstanding.
Statement of cash flows
We have defined cash as cash and due from banks.
Distributions received from equity method investees
are classified as cash inflows from operating activities
on the statement of cash flows. Excess returns on
investments of equity method investments are
classified as cash flows from investing activities on
the statement of cash flows.
Note 2–Accounting changes and new
accounting guidance
The following accounting guidance was adopted in
2024.
ASU 2023-02, Investments—Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in
Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional
Amortization Method
In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-02, Investments—
Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323):
Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures
Using the Proportional Amortization Method, which
permits reporting entities to elect to account for their
tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit
program from which the income tax credits are
received, using the proportional amortization method
if certain conditions are met. Under the proportional
amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial
cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax
credits and other income tax benefits received, and
recognizes the net amortization and income tax
credits and other income tax benefits in the income
statement as a component of the provision for income
taxes.
We adopted this guidance on Jan. 1, 2024. The
impact of adopting this new guidance for our
renewable energy investments that met the eligibility
criteria was an increase in investment and other
revenue and an increase in the provision for income
taxes on the consolidated income statement.
Renewable energy investments are recorded in other
assets on the balance sheet. In 2024, we restated the
prior period financial statements to reflect the impact
of the retrospective application of the new accounting
guidance. The required disclosures are included in
Note 8.
The table below presents the impact of the new accounting guidance on our previously reported income statement
amounts.

ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):
Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07,
Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to
Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a
public entity to disclose, on an annual and interim
basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly
provided to the chief operating decision maker
(“CODM”) and included within each reported
measure of segment profit or loss (collectively
referred to as the “significant expense principle”). In
addition, disclosure will be required of the title and
position of CODM, and how the CODM uses the
reported measure of segment profit or loss in
assessing segment performance and deciding how to
allocate resources.
We adopted this guidance as of Dec. 31, 2024. The
impact of adopting this ASU did not have a material
effect on BNY’s business segment disclosures. The
required disclosures are included in Note 24.
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 122
In January 2025, the SEC staff released Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 122 (“SAB 122”), which
rescinds the interpretative guidance included in SAB
121 which had expressed the staff’s views regarding
the accounting for entities that have obligations to
safeguard “crypto-assets” held for their platform
users. SAB 121 provided that these entities should
present a liability and corresponding asset in respect
of the crypto-assets safeguarded for their platform
users. We have elected to early adopt SAB 122 on a
retrospective basis as of and for the year-ended Dec.
31, 2024. Adopting SAB 122 had no impact to our
balance sheet. We will continue to determine
whether to recognize a liability related to the risk of
loss related to our obligation to safeguard client assets
based on incurring a loss contingency that is both
probable and reasonably estimable.
Note 3–Acquisitions and dispositions
We sometimes structure our acquisitions and
divestitures with both an initial payment or receipt
and later contingent payments or receipts tied to postclosing revenue or income growth.
At Dec. 31, 2024, we are potentially obligated to pay
additional consideration which is recorded at fair
value totaling approximately $5 million and, using
reasonable assumptions and estimates, could range
from $0 million to $5 million over the next year.
During 2024, we made contingent payments that
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
148 BNY
totaled $14 million. We recorded a decrease of $3
million to contingent earnout payables reflected in
other expense in 2024.
At Dec. 31, 2024, we could potentially receive
additional consideration which is recorded at fair
value totaling approximately $15 million and, using
reasonable assumptions and estimates, could range
from $5 million to $25 million over the next three
years. During 2024, contingent receipts totaled $18
million.
Transactions in 2024
On Nov. 1, 2024, we acquired all of the outstanding
ownership interests in Archer Holdco, LLC, a leading
technology-enabled service provider of managed
account solutions to the asset and wealth management
industry, for cash. Non-tax deductible goodwill,
software and a customer contract intangible asset
were recorded related to this acquisition, and are
included in the Securities Services business segment.
Transactions in 2022
On Nov. 1, 2022, BNY completed the sale of BNY

and related to other debt securities.
(d) Represents fair value hedge basis adjustments related to active
portfolio layer method hedges of available-for-sale securities,
which are not allocated to individual securities in the portfolio.
See Note 23 for additional information on our hedging
activities.
(e) Held-to-maturity securities transferred from available-for-sale
are initially recorded at fair value as of the date of transfer.
The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities includes the
net unamortized portion of unrealized gains and losses related
to securities transferred, which are offset in OCI. See Note 16
for additional information.

In 2024, U.S. Treasury securities and CLOs with an
aggregate amortized cost of $4.0 billion and fair value
of $3.7 billion were transferred from available-forsale securities to held-to-maturity securities. This
transfer reduced the impact of changes in interest
rates on accumulated OCI.
Allowance for credit losses – Securities
The allowance for credit losses related to securities
was less than $1 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and related
to other debt securities. The allowance for credit
losses related to securities was $1 million at Dec. 31,
2023, and related to non-agency RMBS and other
debt securities.
Credit quality indicators – Securities
At Dec. 31, 2024, the gross unrealized losses on the
securities portfolio were primarily attributable to an
increase in interest rates from the date of purchase,
and for certain securities that were transferred from
available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, an increase in
interest rates through the date they were transferred.
As the transfers created a new cost basis for the
securities, if these securities have experienced
unrealized losses since the date of transfer, the
corresponding unrealized losses would be reflected in
the held-to-maturity securities portfolio in the
following tables.

Pledged assets
At Dec. 31, 2024, BNY had pledged assets of $138
billion, including $88 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $10 billion pledged as collateral for
borrowing at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The
components of the assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2024
included $117 billion of securities, $15 billion of
loans, $5 billion of trading assets and $1 billion of
interest-bearing deposits with banks.
If there has been no borrowing at the Federal Reserve
Discount Window, the Federal Reserve generally
allows banks to freely move assets in and out of their
pledged assets account to sell or repledge the assets
for other purposes. BNY regularly moves assets in
and out of its pledged assets account at the Federal
Reserve.
At Dec. 31, 2023, BNY had pledged assets of $134
billion, including $93 billion pledged as collateral for
potential borrowing at the Federal Reserve Discount
Window and $9 billion pledged as collateral for
borrowing at the Federal Home Loan Bank. The
components of the assets pledged at Dec. 31, 2023
included $116 billion of securities, $13 billion of
loans, $4 billion of trading assets and $1 billion of
interest-bearing deposits with banks.
At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, pledged assets
included $23 billion and $24 billion, respectively, for
which the recipients were permitted to sell or
repledge the assets delivered.
We also obtain securities as collateral, including
receipts under resale agreements, securities borrowed,
derivative contracts and custody agreements, on terms
which permit us to sell or repledge the securities to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 153
others. At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the
market value of the securities received that can be
sold or repledged was $300 billion and $212 billion,
respectively. We routinely sell or repledge these
securities through delivery to third parties. As of
Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the market value of
securities collateral sold or repledged was $264
billion and $180 billion, respectively.
Restricted cash and securities
Cash and securities may be segregated under federal
and other regulations or requirements. At Dec. 31,
2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, cash segregated under
federal and other regulations or requirements was $1
billion and $3 billion, respectively. Restricted cash is
primarily included in interest-bearing deposits with
banks on the consolidated balance sheet. Securities
segregated under federal and other regulations or
requirements were $5 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $3
billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Restricted securities were
sourced from securities purchased under resale
agreements and securities borrowings and are

Loan modifications
Modified loans are evaluated to determine whether a
modification or restructuring with a borrower
experiencing financial difficulty results in principal
forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, an other-thaninsignificant payment delay, or a term extension. The
modification could result in a new loan or a
continuation of the existing loan.
In 2024, we modified five commercial real estate
loans, with an aggregate recorded investment of
$212 million and unfunded lending commitments of
$20 million, by extending the maturity dates, and, in
certain instances, changing the interest rate or
providing other payment modifications. Commercial
real estate loans of $118 million were repaid prior to
Dec. 31, 2024, and unfunded lending commitments of
$16 million were canceled prior to Dec. 31, 2024.
Also in 2024, we also modified four other residential
mortgage loans, with an aggregate recorded
investment of $1 million, by providing payment
modifications.
At Dec. 31, 2024, other residential mortgage loans
that were modified in the previous 12 months and that
are now past due by more than 90 days totaled $1
million.
In 2023, we modified two commercial real estate
loans, with an aggregate recorded investment of
$71 million and an unfunded lending commitment of
$15 million, by extending the maturity dates. One of
these loans matured in 2023 after the modification.
Also in 2023, we modified six other residential
mortgage loans, with an aggregate recorded
investment of $2 million, by providing payment
modifications, extending maturity dates, reducing the
interest rate, or a combination of these modifications.

Credit quality indicators
Our credit strategy is to focus on investment-grade clients that are active users of our non-credit services. Each
customer is assigned an internal credit rating, which is mapped to an external rating agency grade equivalent, if
possible, based upon a number of dimensions, which are continually evaluated and may change over time.
The tables below provide information about the credit profile of the loan portfolio by the period of origination.

(b) The gross write-offs related to other residential mortgage loans were $3 million in 2023.
Commercial loans
The commercial loan portfolio is divided into
investment grade and non-investment grade
categories based on the assigned internal credit
ratings, which are generally consistent with those of
the public rating agencies. Customers with ratings
consistent with BBB- (S&P)/Baa3 (Moody’s) or
better are considered to be investment grade. Those
clients with ratings lower than this threshold are
considered to be non-investment grade.
Commercial real estate
Our income-producing commercial real estate
facilities are focused on experienced owners and are
structured with moderate leverage based on existing
cash flows. Our commercial real estate lending
activities also include construction and renovation
facilities.
Financial institutions
Financial institution exposures are high-quality, with
96% of the exposures meeting the investment grade
equivalent criteria of our internal credit rating
classification at Dec. 31, 2024. In addition, 67% of
the financial institutions exposure is secured. For
example, securities industry clients and asset
managers often borrow against marketable securities
held in custody. The exposure to financial
institutions is generally short-term, with 84% expiring
within one year.
Wealth management loans
Wealth management loans are not typically rated by
external rating agencies. A majority of the wealth
management loans are secured by the customers’
investment management accounts or custody
accounts. Eligible assets pledged for these loans are
typically investment grade fixed-income securities,
equities and/or mutual funds. Internal ratings for this
portion of the wealth management loan portfolio,
therefore, would equate to investment grade external
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
158 BNY
ratings. Wealth management loans are provided to
select customers based on the pledge of other types of
assets. For the loans collateralized by other assets,
the credit quality of the obligor is carefully analyzed,
but we do not consider this portion of wealth
management loan portfolio to be investment grade.
Wealth management mortgages
Credit quality indicators for wealth management
mortgages are not correlated to external ratings.
Wealth management mortgages are typically loans to
high-net-worth individuals, which are secured
primarily by residential property. These loans are
primarily interest-only, adjustable rate mortgages
with a weighted-average loan-to-value ratio of 61% at
origination. Delinquency rate is a key indicator of
credit quality in the wealth management portfolio. At
Dec. 31, 2024, less than 1% of the mortgages were
past due.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the wealth management mortgage
portfolio consisted of the following geographic
concentrations: California – 21%; New York – 14%;
Florida – 11%; Massachusetts – 8%; and other –
46%.
Lease financings
At Dec. 31, 2024, all of leasing exposure was
investment grade, or investment grade equivalent and
consisted of exposures backed by well-diversified
assets. The largest components of our lease residual
value exposure related to real estate and large-ticket
transportation equipment. Assets are both foreign
and domestic-based, with primary concentrations in
Germany and the U.S.
Other residential mortgages
The other residential mortgage portfolio primarily
consists of 1-4 family residential mortgage loans and
totaled $1.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $1.2 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023. These loans are not typically
correlated to external ratings.
Capital call financing
Capital call financing includes loans to private equity
funds that are secured by the fund investors’ capital
commitments and the funds’ right to call capital.
Other loans
Other loans primarily include loans to consumers that
are fully collateralized with equities, mutual funds
and fixed-income securities.
Margin loans
We had $19.1 billion of secured margin loans at Dec.
31, 2024, compared with $18.0 billion at Dec. 31,
2023. Margin loans are collateralized with
marketable securities, and borrowers are required to
maintain a daily collateral margin in excess of 100%
of the value of the loan. We have rarely suffered a
loss on these types of loans.
Overdrafts
Overdrafts primarily relate to custody and securities
clearance clients and totaled $3.5 billion at Dec. 31,
2024 and $3.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2023. Overdrafts
occur on a daily basis and are generally repaid within
two business days.
Reverse repurchase agreements
Reverse repurchase agreements at Dec. 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023 were fully secured with high-quality
collateral. As a result, there was no allowance for
credit losses related to these assets at Dec. 31, 2024
and Dec. 31, 2023.

Note 6–Leasing
We have operating leases for corporate offices, data
centers and certain equipment. Our leases have
remaining lease terms up to 14 years, some of which
include options to extend or terminate the lease. In

into sublease arrangements for portions or all of the
space and/or lease term.

Goodwill impairment testing
The goodwill impairment test is performed at least
annually at the reporting unit level. BNY’s business
segments include seven reporting units for which
goodwill impairment testing is performed. An
interim goodwill impairment test is performed when
events or circumstances occur that may indicate that
it is more likely than not that the fair value of any
reporting unit may be less than its carrying value.
In each quarter of 2024, we completed an interim
goodwill impairment test of the Investment
Management reporting unit, which had $6.0 billion of
allocated goodwill as of Dec. 31, 2024. In all cases,
we determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit exceeded its carrying
value and no goodwill impairment was recorded.
For the Dec. 31, 2024 test, the fair value of the
Investment Management reporting unit exceeded its
carrying value by approximately 11%. We
determined the fair value of the Investment
Management reporting unit using an income approach
based on management’s projections as of Dec. 31,
2024. The discount rate applied to these cash flows
was 10.5%.
The cash flow estimates for the Investment
Management reporting unit are impacted by
projections of the level and mix of assets under
management, market values, operating margins and
long-term growth rates.
In the second quarter of 2024, we performed our
annual goodwill impairment test on the remaining six
reporting units using an income approach to estimate
the fair values of each reporting unit. Estimated cash
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 161
flows used in the income approach were based on
management’s projections as of April 1, 2024. The
discount rate applied to these cash flows was 10%.
As a result of the annual goodwill impairment test, no
goodwill impairment was recognized. The fair values
of the Company’s remaining six reporting units were
substantially in excess of the respective reporting
units’ carrying value.
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is
subject to uncertainty as it is reliant on estimates of
cash flows that extend far into the future, and, by
their nature, are difficult to estimate over such an
extended time frame. In the future, changes in the
assumptions or the discount rate could produce a
material non-cash goodwill impairment.
In the third quarter 2022, based on results of an
interim goodwill impairment test we recorded an
impairment charge of $680 million. This goodwill
impairment represents a non-cash charge and did not
affect BNY’s liquidity position, tangible common
equity or regulatory capital ratios.

Non-readily marketable equity securities
Non-readily marketable equity securities do not have
readily determinable fair values. These investments
are valued using a measurement alternative where the
investments are carried at cost, less any impairment,
and plus or minus changes resulting from observable
price changes in orderly transactions for an identical
or similar investment of the same issuer. The
observable price changes are recorded in investment
and other revenue on the consolidated income
statement. Our non-readily marketable equity
securities totaled $413 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and
$479 million at Dec. 31, 2023, and are included in

Tax credits and other tax benefits recognized were
$418 million in 2024, $373 million in 2023 and $325
million in 2022.
Amortization expense included in the provision for

Investments valued using net asset value (“NAV”) per
share
In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. We also hold private equity
investments, primarily small business investment
companies (“SBICs”), which are compliant with the
Volcker Rule, and certain other corporate
investments. Seed capital, private equity and other
corporate investments are included in other assets on
the consolidated balance sheet. The fair value of
certain of these investments was estimated using the
NAV per share for our ownership interest in the
funds.
The table below presents information on our investments valued using NAV.

(a) Seed capital investments at Dec. 31, 2024 are generally redeemable on request. Distributions are received as the underlying
investments in the funds, which have redemption notice periods of up to seven days, are liquidated.
(b) Private equity investments primarily include Volcker Rule-compliant investments in SBICs that invest in various sectors of the economy.
Private equity investments do not have redemption rights. Distributions from such investments will be received as the underlying
investments in the private equity investments, which have a life of 10 years, are liquidated.
Note 9–Deposits
Time deposits in denominations of $250,000 or more
totaled $2.1 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $1.5 billion
at Dec. 31, 2023.
At Dec. 31, 2024, the scheduled maturities of total
time deposits are $4.1 billion in 2025, $557 million in
2026, $330 million in 2027, $361 million in 2028 and
$251 million in 2029. No time deposits are scheduled
to mature after 2029.
Note 10–Contract revenue
Fee and other revenue in the Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and
Wealth Management business segments is primarily
variable, based on levels of assets under custody and/
or administration (“AUC/A”), AUM and the level of
client-driven transactions, as specified in fee
schedules.
Investment services fees are based primarily on the
market value of AUC/A; client accounts, balances
and the volume of transactions; securities lending
volume and spreads; and fees for other services.
Certain fees based on the market value of assets are
calculated in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Investment services fees also include transactionbased fees, which are driven by customer actions and
are delivered at a point-in-time. These transactionbased fees are generally recognized on trade date.
Other contractual investment services fees are driven
by the amount of AUC/A or the number of accounts
or securities positions and are billed on a monthly or
quarterly basis.
Substantially all services within the Securities
Services and Market and Wealth Services business
segments are provided over time. Revenue on these
services is recognized using the time elapsed method,
equal to the expected invoice amount, which typically
represents the value provided to the customer for our
performance completed to date.
Investment management fees are dependent on the
overall level and mix of AUM. The management
fees, expressed in basis points, are charged for
managing those assets. Management fees are
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
164 BNY
typically subject to fee schedules contained in an
investment management agreement or fund
documents based on the overall level of assets
managed and products in which those assets are
invested.
Investment management fee revenue also includes
transactional- and account-based fees. These fees,
along with distribution and servicing fees, are
recognized when the services have been completed.
Clients are generally billed for services performed on
a monthly or quarterly basis.
Performance fees are generally calculated as a
percentage of the applicable portfolio’s performance
in excess of a benchmark index or a peer group’s
performance. Performance fees are recognized at the
end of the measurement period when they are
determinable.
See Note 24 for additional information on our
principal business segments, Securities Services,
Market and Wealth Services and Investment and
Wealth Management, and the primary services
provided.
Disaggregation of contract revenue
Contract revenue is included in fee and other revenue on the consolidated income statement. The following tables
present fee and other revenue related to contracts with customers, disaggregated by type of fee revenue, for each

Contract balances
Our clients are billed based on fee schedules that are
agreed upon in each customer contract. Receivables
from customers were $2.5 billion at Dec. 31, 2024
and $2.6 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
Contract assets represent accrued revenues that have
not yet been billed to the customers due to certain
contractual terms other than the passage of time and
were $34 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $27 million at
Dec. 31, 2023. Accrued revenues recorded as
contract assets are usually billed on an annual basis.
Both receivables from customers and contract assets
are included in other assets on the consolidated
balance sheet.
Contract liabilities represent payments received in
advance of providing services under certain contracts
and were $171 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $172
million at Dec. 31, 2023. Contract liabilities are
included in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet. Revenue recognized in 2024 relating
to contract liabilities as of Dec. 31, 2023 was $116
million.
Changes in contract assets and liabilities primarily
relate to either party’s performance under the
contracts.
Contract costs
Incremental costs for obtaining contracts that are
deemed recoverable are capitalized as contract costs.
Such costs result from the payment of sales
incentives, primarily in the Wealth Management
business, and totaled $44 million at Dec. 31, 2024
and $46 million at Dec. 31, 2023. Capitalized sales
incentives are amortized based on the transfer of
goods or services to which the assets relate. The
amortization of capitalized sales incentives, which is
primarily included in staff expense on the
consolidated income statement, totaled $14 million in
2024, $16 million in 2023 and $19 million in 2022.
Costs to fulfill a contract are capitalized when they
relate directly to an existing contract or a specific
anticipated contract, generate or enhance resources
that will be used to fulfill performance obligations,
and are recoverable. Such costs generally represent
set-up costs, which include any direct cost incurred at
the inception of a contract which enables the
fulfillment of the performance obligation, and totaled
$98 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $90 million at Dec.
31, 2023. These capitalized costs are amortized on a
straight-line basis over the expected contract period.
Unsatisfied performance obligations
We do not have any unsatisfied performance
obligations other than those that are subject to a
practical expedient election under ASC 606, Revenue
From Contracts With Customers. The practical
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
166 BNY
expedient election applies to (i) contracts with an
original expected length of one year or less, and (ii)
contracts for which we recognize revenue at the
amount to which we have the right to invoice for
services performed.

As of Dec. 31, 2024, BNY had $101 million of U.S.
foreign tax credit carryforwards which will begin to
expire in 2029. In addition, we have an unrealized
capital loss of $34 million. We believe it is more
likely than not that the benefit from these items will
not be realized. Accordingly, we have recorded a
valuation allowance of $135 million. We believe it is
more likely than not that we will fully realize our
remaining deferred tax assets. This conclusion is
based on historical financial results and profit
forecasts.
As of Dec. 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.4
billion of earnings attributable to foreign subsidiaries
that have been permanently reinvested abroad and for
which no local distribution tax provision has been
recorded. If these earnings were to be repatriated, the
estimated tax liability as of Dec. 31, 2024 would be
up to $170 million.

We recognize accrued interest and penalties, if
applicable, related to income taxes in income tax
expense. Included in the balance sheet at Dec. 31,
2024 is accrued interest, where applicable, of $41
million. The additional tax expense related to interest
for the year ended Dec. 31, 2024 was $2 million,
compared with $6 million for the year ended Dec. 31,

It is reasonably possible the total reserve for uncertain
tax positions could decrease within the next 12

Note 14–Variable interest entities
We have variable interests in VIEs, which include
investments in retail, institutional and alternative
investment funds.
We earn management fees from these funds, as well
as performance fees in certain funds, and may also
provide start-up capital for new funds. The funds are
primarily financed by our customers’ investments in
the funds’ equity or debt.
Additionally, we invest in qualified affordable
housing and renewable energy projects, which are
designed to generate a return primarily through the
realization of tax credits. The projects, which are
structured as limited partnerships and limited liability
companies, are also VIEs, but are not consolidated.
The following table presents the incremental assets
and liabilities included on the consolidated balance
sheet as of Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023. The net
assets of any consolidated VIE are solely available to
settle the liabilities of the VIE and to settle any
investors’ ownership liquidation requests, including
any seed capital we invested in the VIE.

Common stock
BNY has 3.5 billion authorized shares of common
stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. At Dec. 31,
2024, 717,680,268 shares of common stock were
outstanding.
In July 2024, our Board of Directors approved a 12%
increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common
stock, from $0.42 to $0.47 per share. We began
paying the increased quarterly cash dividend in the
third quarter of 2024.
Common stock repurchase program
In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This share
repurchase plan replaced all previously authorized
share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity
under the existing January 2023 authorization.
In 2024, we repurchased 48.9 million common shares
at an average price of $62.70 per common share for a
total of $3.1 billion.
Share repurchases may be executed through open
market repurchases, in privately negotiated
transactions or by other means, including through
repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule
10b5-1 and other derivative, accelerated share
repurchase and other structured transactions. The
timing and exact amount of any common stock
repurchases will depend on various factors, including
market conditions and the common stock trading
price; the Company’s capital position, liquidity and
financial performance; alternative uses of capital; and
legal and regulatory limitations and considerations.
Preferred stock
The Parent has 100 million authorized shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.01 per share. The following

BNY’s ability to declare or pay dividends on, or
purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire, shares of our
common stock or any of our shares that rank junior to
the preferred stock as to the payment of dividends
and/or the distribution of any assets on any
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Parent
will be prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, in
the event that we do not declare and pay in full
preferred dividends for the then-current dividend
period (in the case of dividends) or most recently
completed dividend period (in the case of
repurchases) of the Series A preferred stock or the
last preceding dividend period (in the case of
dividends) or most recently completed dividend

All of the outstanding shares of the Series A preferred
stock are owned by Mellon Capital IV, a 100%
owned financing subsidiary of the Parent, which will
pass through any dividend on the Series A preferred
stock to the holders of its Normal Preferred Capital
Securities. The Parent’s obligations under the trust
and other agreements relating to Mellon Capital IV
have the effect of providing a full and unconditional
guarantee, on a subordinated basis, of payments due
on the Normal Preferred Capital Securities. No other
subsidiary of the Parent guarantees the securities of
Mellon Capital IV. All of the outstanding shares of
the Series F, Series G, Series H and Series I preferred
stock are held by the depositary of the depositary
shares, which will pass through the applicable portion
of any dividend on the Series F, Series G, Series H
and Series I preferred stock to the holders of record of
their respective depositary shares.
In December 2023, the Parent redeemed all
outstanding shares of its Series D preferred stock,
$100,000 liquidation preference per share. Deferred
fees of approximately $10 million were realized as
preferred stock dividends upon redemption.

Temporary equity
Temporary equity was $87 million at Dec. 31, 2024
and $85 million at Dec. 31, 2023. Temporary equity
represents the redemption value recorded for
redeemable noncontrolling interests resulting from
equity-classified share-based payment arrangements
that are currently redeemable or are expected to
become redeemable.
Capital adequacy
Regulators establish certain levels of capital for bank
holding companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including
BNY and our bank subsidiaries, in accordance with
established quantitative measurements. For the
Parent to maintain its status as a financial holding
company, our U.S. bank subsidiaries and BNY must,
among other things, qualify as “well capitalized.” As
of Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, BNY and our
U.S. bank subsidiaries were “well capitalized.”
The regulatory capital ratios of our consolidated and
largest bank subsidiary, The Bank of New York
Mellon, are shown below.
Consolidated and largest bank
subsidiary regulatory capital ratios (a) Dec. 31,
2024 2023
Consolidated regulatory capital ratios:
Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) ratio 11.2% 11.5%
Tier 1 capital ratio 13.7 14.2
Total capital ratio 14.8 14.9
Tier 1 leverage ratio 5.7 6.0
Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) (b) 6.5 7.3
The Bank of New York Mellon
regulatory capital ratios:
CET1 ratio 16.1% 16.2%
Tier 1 capital ratio 16.1 16.2
Total capital ratio 16.3 16.3
Tier 1 leverage ratio 6.3 6.6
SLR (b) 7.6 8.5
(a) For our CET1, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratios, our
effective capital ratios under U.S. capital rules are the lower
of the ratios as calculated under the Standardized and
Advanced Approaches. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is based
on Tier 1 capital and quarterly average total assets. For
BNY to qualify as “well capitalized,” its Tier 1 capital and
Total capital ratios must be at least 6% and 10%,
respectively. For The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest
bank subsidiary, to qualify as “well capitalized,” its CET1,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios must
be at least 6.5%, 8%, 10% and 5%, respectively.
(b) The SLR is based on Tier 1 capital and total leverage
exposure, which includes certain off-balance sheet
exposures. For The Bank of New York Mellon to qualify as
“well capitalized,” its SLR must be at least 6%.
Failure to satisfy regulatory standards, including
“well capitalized” status or capital adequacy rules
more generally, could result in limitations on our
activities and adversely affect our financial condition.
If a BHC such as BNY, or a bank such as The Bank
of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A., fails to
satisfy minimum capital requirements or qualify as
“adequately capitalized,” regulatory sanctions and
limitations will be imposed.

Note 17–Stock-based compensation
Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the
issuance of restricted stock, restricted stock units
(“RSUs”) and other stock-based awards, including
options, to employees and directors of BNY. At Dec.
31, 2024, under the Long-Term Incentive Plan
approved in April 2023, we may issue 37,099,283
new stock-based awards, all of which may be issued
as restricted stock or RSUs. Stock-based
compensation expense related to retirement eligibility
vesting totaled $77 million in 2024, $81 million in
2023 and $72 million in 2022.
RSUs and Performance share units
RSUs are granted under our long-term incentive plans
at no cost to the recipient. These awards are subject
to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed,
including continued employment, for a specified
period. An RSU entitles the recipient to receive a
share of common stock after the applicable
restrictions lapse. The recipient generally is entitled
to receive cash payments equivalent to any dividends
paid on the underlying common stock during the
period the RSU is outstanding but does not receive
voting rights. The cash dividends are paid at the time
of vesting.
The fair value of RSUs is equal to the fair market
value of our common stock on the date of grant. The
expense is recognized over the vesting period, which
is generally zero to four years. The total
compensation expense recognized for RSUs was
$386 million in 2024, $332 million in 2023 and $293
million in 2022. The total income tax benefit
recognized in the consolidated income statement
related to compensation costs was $92 million in
2024, $79 million in 2023 and $69 million in 2022.
BNY’s Executive Committee members were granted
a target award of 851,939 performance share units
(“PSUs”) in 2024, 577,549 in 2023 and 513,101 in
2022. The Executive Committee PSUs will vest
based on two separate and distinct measurements, a
performance condition and a market condition split
70% based on return on tangible common
shareholders’ equity (“ROTCE”) and 30% on Total
Shareholder Return (“TSR”). The ROTCE portion
was measured based on the fair market value on the
date of the grant, while the TSR portion was valued
using a Monte Carlo simulation method. Each
condition only impacts its applicable portion
(70%/30%) of the total PSU award. The performance
and market conditions are measured after three years
to determine the final percentage of the total PSUs to
vest. The final total amount of vested PSUs will be
the sum of the two separate and distinct performance
and market-based portions of the PSU awards, but
will be capped at 150% of the total PSUs awarded.
The ultimate payout is subject to the discretion of the
Human Resources and Compensation Committee.
These awards are classified as equity and the ROTCE
portion is marked-to-market to earnings as a result of
this discretion. The TSR portion of the award
contains a market condition, and as a result the grant
date fair value is recognized over the service period
unless the requisite service is not rendered.
The following table summarizes our non-vested PSU
and RSU activity for 2024.

As of Dec. 31, 2024, $434 million of total
unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested PSUs and RSUs is expected to be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.
The total fair value of RSUs and PSUs that vested
was $347 million in 2024, $305 million in 2023 and
$264 million in 2022. The actual excess tax benefit
realized for the tax deductions from shares vested
totaled $7 million in 2024, $3 million in 2023 and
$16 million in 2022. The tax impacts were
recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Subsidiary Long-Term Incentive Plans
BNY also has several subsidiary Long-Term
Incentive Plans which have issued restricted
subsidiary shares to certain employees. These share
awards are subject to forfeiture until certain
restrictions have lapsed, including continued
employment for a specified period of time. The
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 175
shares are generally non-voting and non-dividend
paying. Once the restrictions lapse, which generally
occurs in three to five years, the shares can only be
sold, at the option of the employee, to BNY at a price
based generally on the fair value of the subsidiary at
the time of repurchase. In certain instances, BNY has
an election to call the shares.
Stock options
Our Long-Term Incentive Plans provide for the
issuance of stock options at fair market value at the
date of grant to officers and employees of BNY. No
stock options were granted in 2024, 2023 or 2022,
and no stock options were outstanding at Dec. 31,
2024, Dec. 31, 2023 or Dec. 31, 2022.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $15
million in 2022. Cash received from option exercises
totaled $9 million in 2022. The actual excess tax
benefit realized for the tax deductions from options
exercised totaled $3 million in 2022 and was
recognized in the provision for income taxes.
Note 18–Employee benefit plans
BNY has defined benefit and/or defined contribution
retirement plans and other post-retirement plans
providing healthcare benefits.
The defined benefit pension plans cover
approximately 6,400 U.S. employees and
approximately 18,400 non-U.S. employees.
BNY has one qualified and several non-qualified
defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and several
pension plans overseas.
Effective June 30, 2015, the benefit accruals under
the U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit
plans were frozen. This change resulted in no
additional benefits being earned by participants in
those plans based on service or pay after June 30,
2015. These plans were previously closed to new
participants effective Dec. 31, 2010.
Effective Dec. 31, 2018, the benefit accruals were
frozen under our largest foreign plan, which covers
certain UK employees. This change resulted in no
additional benefits being earned by participants in
that plan based on service or pay after Dec. 31, 2018.
Most UK employees currently earn benefits only on a
defined contribution basis. UK employees impacted
by the pension plan freeze began earning benefits on
a defined contribution basis on Jan. 1, 2019.

N/A – Not applicable.
A number of key assumptions and measurement date
values determine pension expense. The key elements
include the long-term rate of return on plan assets, the
discount rate, the market-related value of plan assets
and the price used to value stock in the Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”).
The discount rate for U.S. pension plans was
determined after reviewing equivalent rates obtained
by discounting the pension plans’ expected cash
flows using various high-quality, long-term corporate
bond yield curves. We also reviewed the results of
several models that matched bonds to our pension
cash flows. After reviewing the various indices and
models, we selected a discount rate of 5.72% as of
Dec. 31, 2024.
The discount rates for foreign pension plans are based
on high-quality corporate bond rates in countries that
have an active corporate bond market. In those
countries with no active corporate bond market,
discount rates are based on local government bond
rates plus a credit spread.
Actuarial gains on the benefit obligation for the
domestic and foreign pension plans in 2024 are
primarily attributable to increases in discount rates.
Actuarial losses on the benefit obligation for the
domestic pension plans in 2023 are primarily
attributable to decreases in discount rates. Actuarial
losses on the benefit obligation for the foreign
pension plans in 2023 are primarily attributable to
decreases in discount rates and increases in assumed
inflation rates.

Assumed healthcare cost trend
The assumed healthcare cost trend rate used in
determining domestic benefit expense for 2025 is
8.90%, decreasing to 4.50% in 2035 for pre-Medicare
costs and 9.80% decreasing to 4.50% in 2035 for
Medicare costs. The initial trend rate assumption
represents an estimate of short-term cost increases
based on recent health care marketplace experience,
and taking into consideration the cost characteristics
of plans available to retirees. Annual increases in
national health expenditures have exceeded the
general growth in GDP for many years. However,
there are practical limitations to how long these
trends can continue. It is unrealistic to assume that
health care expenditures will be allowed to consume
the majority of the economy. Therefore, over the
long term we expect that health care costs will be
constrained by the public’s ability and willingness to
pay the higher cost of health care coverage. This
assumption implies that the ultimate trend rate should
be related to the expected long-term growth in the
economy. Therefore, we assume the ultimate rate to
be comprised of real growth in per capita GDP, longterm growth attributable to technology innovations,
and the assumed long-term inflation rate. The initial
trend is assumed to decrease to this ultimate rate over
time.
The following benefit payments for the pension and
healthcare plans, which reflect expected future
service as appropriate, are expected to be paid over
the next 10 years:

Plan contributions
We expect to make cash contributions to fund our

for the domestic plans and $6 million for the foreign
plans.
We expect to make cash contributions to fund our
post-retirement healthcare plans in 2025 of $9 million
for the domestic plans and less than $1 million for the
foreign plans.
Investment strategy and asset allocation
We are responsible for the administration of various
employee pension and healthcare post-retirement
benefits plans, both domestically and internationally.
The domestic plans are administered by BNY’s
Benefits Administration Committee, a named
fiduciary. Subject to the following, at all relevant
times, BNY’s Benefits Investment Committee,
another named fiduciary to the domestic plans, is
responsible for the investment of plan assets. The
Benefits Investment Committee’s responsibilities
include the investment of all domestic defined benefit
plan assets, as well as the determination of investment
options offered to participants in all domestic defined
contribution plans. The Benefits Investment
Committee conducts periodic reviews of investment
performance, asset allocation and investment
manager suitability. In addition, the Benefits
Investment Committee has oversight of the Regional
Governance Committees for the foreign defined
benefit plans.
Our investment objective for U.S. and foreign plans is
to maximize total return while maintaining a broadly
diversified portfolio for the primary purpose of
satisfying obligations for future benefit payments.
Our plans are primarily invested in fixed income and
equity securities. In general, for the domestic plan’s
portfolio, fixed income securities can range from 35%
to 100% of plan assets, equity securities and
alternative investments can range from 0% to 65% of
plan assets and cash equivalents can be held in
amounts ranging from 0% to 10% of plan assets.
Actual asset allocation within the approved ranges
varies from time to time based on economic
conditions (both current and forecast), the timing of
transitional reallocations and the advice of
professional advisors.

Fair value measurement of plan assets
We have established a three-level hierarchy for fair
value measurements of our pension plan assets based
upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an
asset as of the measurement date.
The following is a description of the valuation
methodologies used for assets measured at fair value,
as well as the general classification of such assets
pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Cash and currency
This category consists primarily of foreign currency
balances and is included in Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy. Foreign currency is translated monthly
based on current foreign exchange rates.
Common and preferred stock and exchange-traded
funds
These investments include equities and are valued at
the closing price reported in the active market in
which the individual securities are traded, if available.
Common and preferred stock and exchange-traded
funds are included in Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy.
Collective trust funds
Collective trust funds include commingled and U.S.
equity funds that have no readily available market
quotations. The fair value of the funds is based on
the securities in the portfolio, which typically are the
amount that the fund might reasonably expect to
receive for the securities upon a sale. These funds are
valued using observable inputs on either a daily or
monthly basis. Collective trust funds are included in
Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Fixed-income investments
Fixed-income investments include U.S. Treasury
securities, U.S. government agencies, non-U.S.
government securities, sovereign government
obligations, state and political subdivisions, U.S.
corporate bonds and foreign corporate debt funds.
U.S. Treasury and certain non-U.S. government
securities that are actively traded in highly liquid
over-the-counter (“OTC”) markets are valued at the
closing price reported in the active market in which
the individual security is traded and included as Level
1 of the valuation hierarchy. U.S. government
agencies, non-U.S. government securities, sovereign
government obligations, state and political
subdivisions, U.S. corporate bonds and foreign
corporate debt funds are valued based on quoted
prices for comparable securities with similar yields
and credit ratings. When quoted prices are not
available for identical or similar bonds, the bonds are
valued using discounted cash flows that maximize
observable inputs, such as current yields of similar
instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks
that may not be observable, such as credit and
liquidity risks. U.S. government agencies, non-U.S.
government securities, sovereign government
obligations, state and political subdivisions, U.S.
corporate bonds and foreign corporate debt funds are
primarily included in Level 2 of the valuation
hierarchy.
Other assets measured at NAV per share, as a
practical expedient
Other assets measured at NAV, as a practical
expedient, include funds of funds, venture capital and
partnership interests and other funds. There are no
readily available market quotations for these funds.
The fair value of the funds of funds is based on
NAVs of the funds in the portfolio, which reflect the
value of the underlying investments held by the fund,
less its liabilities. The fair value of the underlying
investments is typically the amount that the fund
might reasonably expect to receive upon selling those
hard to value or illiquid investments within the
portfolios. These funds are either valued on a daily or
monthly basis. The fair value of the venture capital
and partnership interests is based on the pension
plan’s ownership percentage of the fair value of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
180 BNY
underlying funds as provided by the fund managers.
These funds are typically valued on a quarterly basis.
The following tables present the fair value of each
major category of plan assets as of Dec. 31, 2024 and

Defined contribution plans
We sponsor defined contribution plans in the U.S.
and in certain non-U.S. locations, all of which are
administered in accordance with local laws. The
most significant defined contribution plan is The
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation 401(k)
Savings Plan sponsored by the Company in the U.S.
and covers substantially all U.S. employees.
Under The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
401(k) Savings Plan for 2024, 2023 and 2022, the
Company matched 100% of participant contributions
up to 7% of an employee’s eligible base pay with a
monetary limit of $16,000 per participant. In
addition, an annual non-elective contribution of $750
was made in 2024, 2023 and 2022 to each participant
with eligible base pay of less than $100,000 a year
and who are credited with at least one year of service.
At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, The Bank of
New York Mellon Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan
owned 7.8 million and 8.7 million shares of our
common stock, respectively. The fair value of total
assets was $10.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $8.8
billion at Dec. 31, 2023. We recorded expenses of
$264 million in 2024, $282 million in 2023 and $276
million in 2022, primarily for contributions to our
defined contribution plans.
We also have an ESOP covering certain domestic
full-time employees hired on or before July 1, 2008.
The ESOP works in conjunction with the defined
benefit pension plan. Employees are entitled to the
higher of their benefit under the ESOP or such
defined benefit pension plan at retirement. Benefits
payable under the defined benefit pension plan are
offset by the equivalent value of benefits earned
under the ESOP.
At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, the ESOP
owned 3.1 million and 3.5 million shares of our
common stock, respectively. The fair value of total
ESOP assets was $244 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and
$185 million at Dec. 31, 2023. The Company is not
permitted to make contributions to the ESOP.
The Benefits Investment Committee appointed
Fiduciary Counselors Inc. to serve as the independent
fiduciary to (i) make all fiduciary decisions related to
the continued prudence of offering the common stock
of BNY or its affiliates as an investment option under
the plans, other than plan sponsor decisions, and (ii)
select and monitor any actively or passively managed
investments that are managed by BNY or its affiliates
to be offered to participants as investment options
under the plans, excluding self-directed accounts.
Note 19–Company financial information
(Parent Corporation)
In connection with our single point of entry resolution
strategy, we have established an intermediate holding
company (“IHC”) to facilitate the provision of capital
and liquidity resources to certain key subsidiaries in
the event of material financial distress or failure. In
2017, we entered into a binding support agreement
with those key subsidiaries and other related entities
that requires the IHC to provide that support. The
support agreement requires the Parent to transfer cash
and other liquid financial assets to the IHC on an
ongoing basis, subject to certain amounts retained by
the Parent to meet its near-term cash needs. The
Parent’s and the IHC’s obligations under the support
agreement are secured. The IHC has provided
unsecured subordinated funding notes to the Parent as
well as a committed line of credit that allows the
Parent to draw funds necessary to service near-term
obligations. As a result, during business-as-usual
circumstances, the Parent is expected to continue to
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
182 BNY
have access to the funds necessary to pay dividends,
repurchase common stock, service its debt and satisfy
its other obligations. If our projected financial
resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the
Parent becomes imminent, the committed line of
credit the IHC provided to the Parent will
automatically terminate, with all amounts outstanding
becoming due and payable, and the support
agreement will require the Parent to transfer most of
its remaining assets (other than stock in subsidiaries
and a cash reserve to fund bankruptcy expenses) to
the IHC. As a result, during a period of severe
financial stress, the Parent could become unable to
meet its debt and payment obligations (including with
respect to its securities), causing the Parent to seek
protection under bankruptcy laws earlier than it
otherwise would have.
Our bank subsidiaries are subject to dividend
limitations under the federal and state banking laws.
Under these statutes, prior regulatory consent is
required for dividends in any year that would exceed
the bank’s net profits for such year combined with
retained net profits for the prior two years.
Additionally, such bank subsidiaries may not declare
dividends in excess of net profits on hand, as defined,
after deducting the amount by which the principal
amount of all loans, on which interest is past due for a
period of six months or more, exceeds the allowance
for credit losses.
The payment of dividends also is limited by
minimum capital requirements and buffers imposed
on banks. As of Dec. 31, 2024, our bank subsidiaries
exceeded these requirements.
Subsequent to Dec. 31, 2024, our U.S. bank
subsidiaries could declare dividends to the Parent of
approximately $82 million, without the need for a
regulatory waiver. In addition, at Dec. 31, 2024, nonbank subsidiaries of the Parent had liquid assets of
approximately $3.8 billion.
The bank subsidiaries declared dividends of $4.3
billion in 2024, $3.5 billion in 2023 and $1.0 billion
in 2022. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency have issued additional
guidelines that require BHCs and national banks to
continually evaluate the level of cash dividends in
relation to their respective operating income, capital
needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
The Federal Reserve policy with respect to the
payment of cash dividends by BHCs provides that, as
a matter of prudent banking, a BHC should not
maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net
income available to common shareholders has been
sufficient to fully fund the dividends, and the
prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be
consistent with the holding company’s capital needs,
asset quality and overall financial condition. The
Federal Reserve can also prohibit a dividend if
payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound
banking practice.
In January 2023, we announced a share repurchase
program approved by our Board of Directors
providing for the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of
common shares beginning Jan. 1, 2023. This new
share repurchase plan replaced all previously
authorized share repurchase plans.
In April 2024, we announced a new authorization
providing for the repurchase of $6.0 billion of
common shares in addition to any remaining capacity
under the existing January 2023 authorization.
The Federal Reserve Act limits, and requires
collateral for, extensions of credit by our insured
subsidiary banks to the Parent and certain of its nonbank affiliates. Also, there are restrictions on the
amounts of investments by such banks in stock and
other securities of BNY and such affiliates, and
restrictions on the acceptance of their securities as
collateral for loans by such banks. Extensions of
credit by the banks to each of our affiliates are limited
to 10% of such bank’s regulatory capital, and in the
aggregate for BNY and all such affiliates to 20%, and
collateral must be between 100% and 130% of the
amount of the credit, depending on the type of
collateral.
In the event of impairment of the capital stock of one
of the Parent’s national banks or The Bank of New
York Mellon, the Parent, as the banks’ stockholder,
could be required to pay such deficiency.
The Parent guarantees the uncommitted lines of credit
of Pershing LLC and Pershing Limited subsidiaries.
The Parent guarantees described above are full and
unconditional and contain the standard provisions
relating to parent guarantees of subsidiary debt.
Additionally, the Parent guarantees or indemnifies
obligations of its consolidated subsidiaries as needed.
Generally, there are no stated notional amounts
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 183
included in these indemnifications and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for
indemnification are not expected to occur. As a
result, we are unable to develop an estimate of the
maximum payout under these indemnifications.
However, we believe the possibility is remote that we
will have to make any material payment under these
guarantees and indemnifications.

Note 20–Fair value measurement
Fair value is defined as the price that would be
received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability,
in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy for
fair value measurements is utilized based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or
liability as of the measurement date. BNY’s own
creditworthiness is considered when valuing
liabilities.
Fair value focuses on exit price in an orderly
transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or
distressed sale) between market participants at the
measurement date under current market conditions.
If there has been a significant decrease in the volume
and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change
in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation
techniques may be appropriate. In such instances,
determining the price at which willing market
participants would transact at the measurement date
under current market conditions depends on the facts
and circumstances and requires the use of significant
judgment. The objective is to determine from
weighted indicators of fair value a reasonable point
within the range that is most representative of fair
value under current market conditions.
Determination of fair value
We have established processes for determining fair
values. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices
in active markets, where available. For financial
instruments where quotes from recent exchange
transactions are not available, we determine fair value
based on discounted cash flow analysis, comparison
to similar instruments and the use of financial models.
Discounted cash flow analysis is dependent upon
estimated future cash flows and the level of interest
rates. Model-based pricing uses inputs of observable
prices, where available, for interest rates, foreign
exchange rates, option volatilities and other factors.
Models are benchmarked and validated by an
independent internal risk management function. Our
valuation process takes into consideration factors
such as counterparty credit quality, liquidity,
concentration concerns and observability of model
parameters. Valuation adjustments may be made to
record financial instruments at fair value.
Most derivative contracts are valued using models
which are calibrated to observable market data and
employ standard market pricing theory for their
valuations. Valuation models incorporate
counterparty credit risk by discounting each trade’s
expected exposures to the counterparty using the
counterparty’s credit spreads, as implied by the credit
default swap market. We also adjust expected
liabilities to the counterparty using BNY’s own credit
spreads, as implied by the credit default swap market.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 185
Accordingly, the valuation of our derivative positions
is sensitive to the current changes in our own credit
spreads, as well as those of our counterparties.
In certain cases, recent prices may not be observable
for instruments that trade in inactive or less active
markets. Upon evaluating the uncertainty in valuing
financial instruments subject to liquidity issues, we
make an adjustment to their value. The determination
of the liquidity adjustment includes the availability of
external quotes, the time since the latest available
quote and the price volatility of the instrument.
Certain parameters in some financial models are not
directly observable and, therefore, are based on
management’s estimates and judgments. These
financial instruments are normally traded less
actively. We apply valuation adjustments to mitigate
the possibility of error and revision in the modelbased estimate value. Examples include products
where parameters such as correlation and recovery
rates are unobservable.
The methods described above for instruments that
trade in inactive or less active markets may produce a
current fair value calculation that may not be
indicative of net realizable value or reflective of
future fair values. We believe our methods of
determining fair value are appropriate and consistent
with other market participants. However, the use of
different methodologies or different assumptions to
value certain financial instruments could result in a
different estimate of fair value.
Valuation hierarchy
A three-level valuation hierarchy is used for
disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the
transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or
liability as of the measurement date. The three levels
are described below.
Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are
quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets. Level 1 assets and
liabilities include certain debt and equity securities,
derivative financial instruments actively traded on
exchanges and highly liquid government bonds.
Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices,
for example, quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that
are not active, and inputs that are observable or can
be corroborated, either directly or indirectly, for
substantially the full term of the financial instrument.
Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt instruments
that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded
securities and derivative financial instruments whose
model inputs are observable in the market or can be
corroborated by market-observable data.
Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are
unobservable and significant to the fair value
measurement.
A financial instrument’s categorization within the
valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Valuation methodology
Following is a description of the valuation
methodologies used for instruments measured at fair
value, as well as the general classification of such
instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.
Securities
We determine fair value primarily based on pricing
sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
Where quoted prices are available in an active
market, we classify the securities within Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. Securities include both long
and short positions. Level 1 securities include U.S.
Treasury and certain non-U.S. government debt
securities that are actively traded in highly liquid
OTC markets, money market funds and exchangetraded equities.
If quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are primarily determined using pricing models using
observable trade data, market data, quoted prices of
securities with similar characteristics or discounted
cash flows. Examples of such instruments, which
would generally be classified within Level 2 of the
valuation hierarchy, include RMBS, MBS, certain
non-U.S. government debt, foreign covered bonds
and CLOs.
Specifically, the pricing sources obtain recent
transactions for similar types of securities (e.g.,
vintage, position in the securitization structure) and
ascertain variables such as discount rate and speed of
prepayment for the types of transaction and apply
such variables to similar types of bonds. We view
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
186 BNY
these as observable transactions in the current
marketplace and classify such securities as Level 2.
Pricing sources discontinue pricing any specific
security whenever they determine there is insufficient
observable data to provide a good-faith opinion on
price.
At Dec. 31, 2024, approximately 99% of our
securities were valued by pricing sources with
reasonable levels of price transparency. The
remaining securities were generally valued using
observable inputs. Additional disclosures of
securities are provided in Note 4.
In certain cases where there is limited activity or less
transparency around inputs to the valuation, we
classify those securities in Level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy. As of Dec. 31, 2024, we have no
instruments included in Level 3 of the valuation
hierarchy.
Derivative financial instruments
We classify exchange-traded derivative financial
instruments valued using quoted prices in Level 1 of
the valuation hierarchy. Examples include exchangetraded equity options and interest rate futures and
options. Since few other classes of derivative
contracts are listed on an exchange, most of our
derivative positions are valued using models that use
as their basis readily observable market parameters,
and we classify them in Level 2 of the valuation
hierarchy. Such derivative financial instruments
include swaps and options, foreign exchange spot and
forward contracts and credit default swaps.
Derivatives valued using models with significant
unobservable market parameters in markets that lack
two-way flow are classified in Level 3 of the
valuation hierarchy. Examples may include longdated swaps and options, where parameters may be
unobservable for longer maturities; and certain highly
structured products, where correlation risk is
unobservable. As of Dec. 31, 2024, we have no
Level 3 derivatives. Additional disclosures of
derivative instruments are provided in Note 23.
Seed capital
In our Investment and Wealth Management business
segment, we make seed capital investments in certain
funds we manage. Seed capital is generally included
in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.
When applicable, we value seed capital based on the
published NAV of the fund.
For other types of investments in funds, we consider
all of the rights and obligations inherent in our
ownership interest, including the reported NAV as
well as other factors that affect the fair value of our
interest in the fund.
Other assets measured at NAV
We hold private equity investments, primarily SBICs,
which are compliant with the Volcker Rule. There
are no readily available market quotations for these
investment partnerships. The fair value of the SBICs
is based on our ownership percentage of the fair value
of the underlying investments as provided by the
partnership managers. These investments are
typically valued on a quarterly basis. Our SBIC
private equity investments are valued at NAV as a
practical expedient for fair value.
The following tables present the financial instruments
carried at fair value at Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023, by caption on the consolidated balance sheet
and by the three-level valuation hierarchy. We have
included credit ratings information in certain of the
tables because the information indicates the degree of
credit risk to which we are exposed, and significant
changes in ratings classifications could result in
increased risk for us.

Note 21–Fair value option
We elected fair value as an alternative measurement
for selected financial assets and liabilities that are not
otherwise required to be measured at fair value,
including the assets and liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds and subordinated notes
associated with certain equity investments.
The following table presents the assets and liabilities
of consolidated investment management funds, at fair
value.
Assets and liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds, at fair value
Dec. 31,
(in millions) 2024 2023
Assets of consolidated investment
management funds:
Trading assets $ 846 $ 510
Other assets 45 16
Total assets of consolidated
investment management funds $ 891 $ 526
Liabilities of consolidated investment
management funds:
Other liabilities $ 5 $ 1
Total liabilities of consolidated
investment management funds $ 5 $ 1
The assets and liabilities of the consolidated
investment management funds are included in other
assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the
consolidated balance sheet. We value the assets and
liabilities of consolidated investment management
funds using quoted prices for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets or observable inputs such
as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities.
Quoted prices for either identical or similar assets or
liabilities in inactive markets may also be used.
Accordingly, fair value best reflects the interests
BNY holds in the economic performance of the
consolidated investment management funds.
Changes in the fair value of the assets and liabilities
are recorded as income (loss) from consolidated
investment management funds, which is included in
investment and other revenue in the consolidated
income statement.
We elected the fair value option on subordinated
notes associated with certain equity investments. The
fair value of these subordinated notes was $26 million
at Dec. 31, 2024 and $4 million at Dec. 31, 2023, and
are included in other assets on the consolidated
balance sheet. The subordinated notes were valued
using observable market inputs and included in Level
2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Note 22–Commitments and contingent
liabilities
Off-balance sheet arrangements
In the normal course of business, various
commitments and contingent liabilities are
outstanding that are not reflected in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Our significant trading and off-balance sheet risks are
securities, foreign currency and interest rate risk
management products, commercial lending
commitments, letters of credit and securities lending
indemnifications. We assume these risks to reduce
interest rate and foreign currency risks, to provide
customers with the ability to meet credit and liquidity
needs and to hedge foreign currency and interest rate
risks. These items involve, to varying degrees, credit,
foreign currency and interest rate risks not recognized
on the balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet risks are
managed and monitored in manners similar to those
used for on-balance sheet risks.
The following table presents a summary of our offbalance sheet credit risks.
Off-balance sheet credit risks Dec. 31,
2024
Dec. 31,
(in millions) 2023
Lending commitments $ 52,581 $ 46,518
Standby letters of credit (“SBLC”) (a) 1,641 1,816
Commercial letters of credit 24 41
Securities lending indemnifications (b)(c) 544,601 492,739
(a) Net of participations totaling $192 million at Dec. 31, 2024
and $163 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
(b) Excludes the indemnification for securities for which BNY
acts as an agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, which
totaled $60 billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $59 billion at Dec.
31, 2023.
(c) Includes cash collateral, invested in indemnified repurchase
agreements, held by us as securities lending agent of $59
billion at Dec. 31, 2024 and $45 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
The total potential loss on undrawn lending
commitments, standby and commercial letters of
credit, and securities lending indemnifications is
equal to the total notional amount if drawn upon,
which does not consider the value of any collateral.
Since many of the lending commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total amount
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
192 BNY
does not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. A summary of lending commitment
maturities is as follows: $32.7 billion in less than one
year, $19.4 billion in one to five years and $440
million over five years.
SBLCs principally support obligations of corporate
clients and were collateralized with cash and
securities of $173 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $158
million at Dec. 31, 2023. At Dec. 31, 2024, $1.3
billion of the SBLCs will expire within one year and
$298 million in one to five years. No SBLCs expire
in over five years.
We must recognize, at the inception of an SBLC and
foreign and other guarantees, a liability for the fair
value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
guarantee. The fair value of the liability, which was
recorded with a corresponding asset in other assets,
was estimated as the present value of contractual
customer fees. The estimated liability for losses
related to SBLCs and foreign and other guarantees, if
any, is included in the allowance for lending-related
commitments.
Payment/performance risk of SBLCs is monitored
using both historical performance and internal ratings
criteria. BNY’s historical experience is that SBLCs
typically expire without being funded. SBLCs below
investment grade are monitored closely for payment/
performance risk. The table below shows SBLCs by
investment grade:
Standby letters of credit Dec. 31,
2024
Dec. 31,
2023
Investment grade 67% 74%
Non-investment grade 33% 26%
A commercial letter of credit is normally a short-term
instrument used to finance a commercial contract for
the shipment of goods from a seller to a buyer.
Although the commercial letter of credit is contingent
upon the satisfaction of specified conditions, it
represents a credit exposure if the buyer defaults on
the underlying transaction. As a result, the total
contractual amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. Commercial letters of
credit totaled $24 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and $41
million at Dec. 31, 2023.
We expect many of the lending commitments and
letters of credit to expire without the need to advance
any cash. The revenue associated with guarantees
frequently depends on the credit rating of the obligor
and the structure of the transaction, including
collateral, if any. The allowance for lending-related
commitments was $72 million at Dec. 31, 2024 and
$87 million at Dec. 31, 2023.
A securities lending transaction is a fully
collateralized transaction in which the owner of a
security agrees to lend the security (typically through
an agent, in our case, The Bank of New York Mellon)
to a borrower, usually a broker-dealer or bank, on an
open, overnight or term basis, under the terms of a
prearranged contract.
We typically lend securities with indemnification
against borrower default. We generally require the
borrower to provide collateral with a minimum value
of 102% of the fair value of the securities borrowed,
which is monitored on a daily basis, thus reducing
credit risk. Market risk can also arise in securities
lending transactions. These risks are controlled
through policies limiting the level of risk that can be
undertaken. Securities lending transactions are
generally entered into only with highly rated
counterparties. Securities lending indemnifications
were secured by collateral of $574 billion at Dec. 31,
2024 and $518 billion at Dec. 31, 2023.
CIBC Mellon, a joint venture between BNY and the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”),
engages in securities lending activities. CIBC
Mellon, BNY and CIBC jointly and severally
indemnify securities lenders against specific types of
borrower default. At Dec. 31, 2024 and Dec. 31,
2023, $60 billion and $59 billion, respectively, of
borrowings at CIBC Mellon, for which BNY acts as
agent on behalf of CIBC Mellon clients, were secured
by collateral of $64 billion and $62 billion,
respectively. If, upon a default, a borrower’s
collateral was not sufficient to cover its related
obligations, certain losses related to the
indemnification could be covered by the indemnitors.
Unsettled repurchase and reverse repurchase
agreements
In the normal course of business, we enter into
repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase
agreements that settle at a future date. In repurchase
agreements, BNY receives cash from and provides
securities as collateral to a counterparty at settlement.
In reverse repurchase agreements, BNY advances
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
BNY 193
cash to and receives securities as collateral from the
counterparty at settlement. These transactions are
recorded on the consolidated balance sheet on the
settlement date. At Dec. 31, 2024, we had no
unsettled repurchase agreements and $96.1 billion of
unsettled reverse repurchase agreements. At Dec. 31,
2023, we had no unsettled repurchase agreements and
$77.9 billion of unsettled reverse repurchase
agreements.
Industry concentrations
We have significant industry concentrations related to
credit exposure at Dec. 31, 2024. The tables below

Major concentrations in securities lending are

Sponsored member repo program
BNY is a sponsoring member in the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) sponsored member
program, where we submit eligible repurchase and
reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. Treasury and
agency securities (“Sponsored Member
Transactions”) between BNY and our sponsored
member clients for novation and clearing through
FICC pursuant to the FICC Government Securities
Division rulebook (the “FICC Rules”). We also
guarantee to FICC the prompt and full payment and
performance of our sponsored member clients’
respective obligations under the FICC Rules in
connection with such clients’ Sponsored Member
Transactions. We minimize our credit exposure
under this guaranty by obtaining a security interest in
our sponsored member clients’ collateral and rights
under Sponsored Member Transactions. See
“Offsetting assets and liabilities” in Note 23 for
additional information on our repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements.
Indemnification arrangements
We have provided standard representations for
underwriting agreements, acquisition and divestiture
agreements, sales of loans and commitments, and
other similar types of arrangements and customary
indemnification for claims and legal proceedings
related to providing financial services that are not
otherwise included above. Insurance has been
purchased to mitigate certain of these risks.
Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts
included in these indemnifications and the
contingencies triggering the obligation for
indemnification are not expected to occur.
Furthermore, often counterparties to these
transactions provide us with comparable
indemnifications. We are unable to develop an
estimate of the maximum payout under these
indemnifications for several reasons. In addition to
the lack of a stated or notional amount in a majority
of such indemnifications, we are unable to predict the
nature of events that would trigger indemnification or
the level of indemnification for a certain event. We
believe, however, that the possibility that we will
have to make any material payments for these
indemnifications is remote. At Dec. 31, 2024 and
Dec. 31, 2023, we have not recorded any material
liabilities under these arrangements.
Clearing and settlement exchanges
We are a noncontrolling equity investor in, and/or
member of, several industry clearing or settlement
exchanges through which foreign exchange,
securities, derivatives or other transactions settle.
Certain of these industry clearing and settlement
exchanges require their members to guarantee their
obligations and liabilities and/or to provide liquidity
support in the event other members do not honor their
obligations. We believe the likelihood that a clearing
or settlement exchange (of which we are a member)
would become insolvent is remote. Additionally,
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
194 BNY
certain settlement exchanges have implemented loss
allocation policies that enable the exchange to
allocate settlement losses to the members of the
exchange. It is not possible to quantify such mark-tomarket loss until the loss occurs. Any ancillary costs
that occur as a result of any mark-to-market loss
cannot be quantified. In addition, we also sponsor
clients as members on clearing and settlement
exchanges and guarantee their obligations. At Dec.
31, 2024 and Dec. 31, 2023, we did not record any
material liabilities under these arrangements.
Legal proceedings
In the ordinary course of business, The Bank of New
York Mellon Corporation and its subsidiaries are
routinely named as defendants in or made parties to
pending and potential legal actions. We also are
subject to governmental and regulatory examinations,
information-gathering requests, investigations and
proceedings (both formal and informal). Claims for
significant monetary damages are often asserted in
many of these legal actions, while claims for
disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other
remedial actions or sanctions may be sought in
governmental and regulatory matters. It is inherently
difficult to predict the eventual outcomes of such
matters given their complexity and the particular facts
and circumstances at issue in each of these matters.
However, on the basis of our current knowledge and
understanding, we do not believe that judgments,
settlements or orders, if any, arising from these
matters (either individually or in the aggregate, after
giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance
coverage) will have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or liquidity of BNY,
although they could have a material effect on our
results of operations in a given period.
In view of the inherent unpredictability of outcomes
in litigation and regulatory matters, particularly where
(i) the damages sought are substantial or
indeterminate, (ii) the proceedings are in the early
stages, or (iii) the matters involve novel legal theories
or a large number of parties, as a matter of course
there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the
timing or ultimate resolution of litigation and
regulatory matters, including a possible eventual loss,
fine, penalty or business impact, if any, associated
with each such matter. In accordance with applicable
accounting guidance, we establish accruals for
litigation and regulatory matters when those matters
proceed to a stage where they present loss
contingencies that are both probable and reasonably
estimable. In such cases, there may be a possible
exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued.
We regularly monitor such matters for developments
that could affect the amount of the accrual, and will
adjust the accrual amount as appropriate. If the loss
contingency in question is not both probable and
reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual
and the matter continues to be monitored for any
developments that would make the loss contingency
both probable and reasonably estimable. We believe
that our accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate
and, in the aggregate, are not material to the
consolidated financial position of BNY, although
future accruals could have a material effect on the
results of operations in a given period. In addition, if
we have the potential to recover a portion of an
estimated loss from a third party, we record a
receivable up to the amount of the accrual that is
probable of recovery.
For certain of those matters described here for which
a loss contingency may, in the future, be reasonably
possible (whether in excess of a related accrued
liability or where there is no accrued liability), BNY
is currently unable to estimate a range of reasonably
possible loss. For those matters described here where
BNY is able to estimate a reasonably possible loss,
the aggregate range of such reasonably possible loss
is up to $690 million in excess of the accrued liability
(if any) related to those matters. For matters where a
reasonably possible loss is denominated in a foreign
currency, our estimate is adjusted quarterly based on
prevailing exchange rates. We do not consider
potential recoveries when estimating reasonably
possible losses.
The following describes certain judicial, regulatory
and arbitration proceedings involving BNY:
Mortgage-Securitization Trusts Proceedings
BNY has been named as a defendant in a number of
legal actions brought by MBS investors alleging that
the trustee has expansive duties under the governing
agreements, including the duty to investigate and
pursue breach of representation and warranty claims
against other parties to the MBS transactions. Two
actions commenced in December 2015 and February
2017 are pending in New York federal court. In New
York state court, five actions are pending: two related
cases commenced in September 2021 and October
2022; and three related cases commenced in October
2021, December 2021 and February 2022.

Matters Related to R. Allen Stanford
In late December 2005, Pershing LLC became a
clearing firm for Stanford Group Co. (“SGC”), a
registered broker-dealer that was part of a group of
entities ultimately controlled by R. Allen Stanford
(“Stanford”). Stanford International Bank, also
controlled by Stanford, issued certificates of deposit
(“CDs”). Some investors allegedly wired funds from
their SGC accounts to purchase CDs. In 2009, the
Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Stanford with operating a Ponzi scheme in connection
with the sale of CDs, and SGC was placed into
receivership. Alleged purchasers of CDs have filed
two putative class action proceedings against
Pershing LLC: one in November 2009 in Texas
federal court, and one in May 2016 in New Jersey
federal court. On Nov. 5, 2021, the court dismissed
the class action filed in New Jersey. Both matters
have concluded. Three lawsuits remain against
Pershing LLC in Louisiana and New Jersey federal
courts, which were filed in January 2010, October
2015 and May 2016. The purchasers allege that
Pershing LLC, as SGC’s clearing firm, assisted
Stanford in a fraudulent scheme and assert
contractual, statutory and common law claims. In
March 2019, a group of investors filed a putative
class action against The Bank of New York Mellon in
New Jersey federal court, making the same
allegations as in the prior actions brought against
Pershing LLC. On Nov. 12, 2021, the court
dismissed the class action against The Bank of New
York Mellon; on Dec. 15, 2022, an appeals court
reversed the dismissal and returned the case to the
trial court for further proceedings. On June 28, 2024,
an unincorporated association that claims to represent
the interests of Stanford investors filed a lawsuit in
New Jersey federal court against The Bank of New
York Mellon, making the same allegations as prior
cases. All of the cases that have been brought in
federal court have been consolidated in Texas federal
court for discovery purposes. Various alleged
Stanford CD purchasers asserted similar claims in
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.
(“FINRA”) arbitration proceedings.
Brazilian Postalis Litigation
BNY Servicos Financeiros DTVM S.A. (“DTVM”), a
subsidiary that provides asset services in Brazil, acts
as administrator for certain investment funds in which
a public pension fund for postal workers called
Postalis-Instituto de Seguridade Social dos Correios e
Telégrafos (“Postalis”) invested. On Aug. 22, 2014,
Postalis sued DTVM in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for
losses related to a Postalis fund for which DTVM is
administrator. Postalis alleges that DTVM failed to
properly perform duties, including to conduct due
diligence of and exert control over the manager. On
March 12, 2015, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de
Janeiro against DTVM and BNY Administração de
Ativos Ltda. (“Ativos”) alleging failure to properly
perform duties relating to another fund of which
DTVM is administrator and Ativos is manager. On
Dec. 14, 2015, Associacão dos Profissionais dos
Correios (“ADCAP”), a Brazilian postal workers
association, filed a lawsuit in São Paulo against
DTVM and other defendants alleging that DTVM
improperly contributed to Postalis investment losses.
On March 20, 2017, the lawsuit was dismissed
without prejudice, and ADCAP appealed. On Aug. 4,
2021, the appellate court overturned the dismissal and
sent the lawsuit to a state lower court. On March 2,
2023, DTVM appealed the August 4 decision to
Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice. On Dec. 17, 2015,
Postalis filed three lawsuits in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM and Ativos alleging failure to properly
perform duties with respect to investments in several
other funds. On May 20, 2021, the court in one of
those lawsuits entered a judgment of approximately
$3 million against DTVM and Ativos. DTVM
appealed and, on June 7, 2022, the appellate court
partially granted and partially denied the appeal,
reducing the judgment to approximately $2 million.
On July 13, 2023, DTVM and Ativos filed a further
appeal to Brazil’s Superior Court of Justice, which
was denied on Sept. 20, 2024. DTVM and Ativos
further appealed, but their appeal was denied on Dec.
3, 2024. On Aug. 24, 2022, the court dismissed one
of the other lawsuits. Postalis appealed that decision,
but Postalis’s appeal was denied on Oct. 24, 2023.
Postalis further appealed; that further appeal was
denied on Oct. 22, 2024. On Feb. 4, 2016, Postalis
filed a lawsuit in Brasilia against DTVM, Ativos and
BNY Alocação de Patrimônio Ltda. (“Alocação de
Patrimônio”), an investment management subsidiary,
alleging failure to properly perform duties and
liability for losses with respect to investments in
various funds of which the defendants were
administrator and/or manager. On Jan. 16, 2018, the
Brazilian Federal Prosecution Service filed a civil
lawsuit in São Paulo against DTVM alleging liability
for Postalis losses based on alleged failures to
properly perform certain duties as administrator to
certain funds in which Postalis invested or as
controller of Postalis’s own investment portfolio. On
April 18, 2018, the court dismissed the lawsuit
without prejudice. On Aug. 4, 2021, the appellate
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
196 BNY
court overturned the dismissal and returned the
lawsuit to the lower court. DTVM appealed, but that
appeal was denied on Aug. 21, 2023. In addition, the
Tribunal de Contas da União (“TCU”), an
administrative tribunal, has initiated proceedings with
the purpose of determining liability for losses to four
investment funds administered by DTVM in which
Postalis was an investor. On Sept. 9, 2020, TCU
rendered a decision in one of the proceedings, finding
DTVM and two former Postalis directors jointly and
severally liable for approximately $50 million. TCU
also imposed on DTVM a fine of approximately $2
million. DTVM’s administrative appeal of the
decision was denied. On Feb. 25, 2022, DTVM filed
a lawsuit in Brazil federal court in Brasilia seeking
annulment of TCU’s decision and an injunction
preventing TCU from enforcing the judgment. On
Aug. 24, 2022, the Brazilian Federal Attorneys filed
an action in Rio de Janeiro court seeking to enforce
the fine portion of the judgment. On Nov. 8, 2022,
the Brasilia federal court in the annulment action
granted DTVM’s request for an injunction,
suspending the Sept. 9, 2020, TCU decision until the
annulment action is decided. On Oct. 4, 2019,
Postalis and another pension fund filed a request for
arbitration in São Paulo against DTVM and Ativos
alleging liability for losses to an investment fund for
which DTVM was administrator and Ativos was
manager. On March 26, 2021, DTVM and Ativos
filed a lawsuit in São Paulo challenging the
Arbitration Court’s jurisdiction over the case. On
Feb. 24, 2023, the São Paulo court annulled the
Arbitration Court’s decision that it had jurisdiction,
and Postalis and the other pension fund appealed. On
April 8, 2024, the appellate court reversed the São
Paulo court’s decision and found that the Arbitration
Court did have jurisdiction. DTVM and Ativos
appealed; that appeal was denied on April 8, 2024.
DTVM and Ativos have further appealed. The
arbitration continues during the further appeal. On
Oct. 25, 2019, Postalis filed a lawsuit in Rio de
Janeiro against DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio,
alleging liability for losses in another fund for which
DTVM was administrator and Alocação de
Patrimônio and Ativos were managers. On May 9,
2022, the court found DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio jointly and severally liable for
approximately $20 million. On Aug. 12, 2022,
DTVM and Alocação de Patrimônio appealed the
decision. On April 30, 2024, the appeals court
reversed the finding against DTVM and Alocação de
Patrimônio. Postalis appealed that reversal and, on
Oct. 3, 2024, its appeal was denied. Postalis has filed
a further appeal. On June 19, 2020, a lawsuit was
filed in federal court in Rio de Janeiro against
DTVM, Postalis, and various other defendants
alleging liability against DTVM for certain Postalis
losses in an investment fund of which DTVM was
administrator. On Feb. 10, 2021, Postalis and another
pension fund served DTVM in a lawsuit filed in Rio
de Janeiro, alleging liability for losses in another
investment fund for which DTVM was administrator
and the other defendant was manager.
Brazilian Silverado Litigation
DTVM acts as administrator for the Fundo de
Investimento em Direitos Creditórios Multisetorial
Silverado Maximum (“Silverado Maximum Fund”),
which invests in commercial credit receivables. On
June 2, 2016, the Silverado Maximum Fund sued
DTVM in its capacity as administrator, along with
Deutsche Bank S.A. - Banco Alemão in its capacity
as custodian and Silverado Gestão e Investimentos
Ltda. in its capacity as investment manager. The
Fund alleges that each of the defendants failed to
fulfill its respective duty, and caused losses to the
Fund for which the defendants are jointly and
severally liable. On March 21, 2024, the São Paulo
court issued a decision finding DTVM, Deutsche
Bank and Silverado Gestão e Investimentos jointly
liable for losses to the Fund in an amount to be
determined during a later calculation phase. On Sept.
12, 2024, DTVM filed an appeal.
German Tax Matters
German authorities are investigating past “cum/ex”
trading, which involved the purchase of equity
securities on or shortly before the dividend date, but
settled after that date, potentially resulting in an
unwarranted refund of withholding tax. German
authorities have taken the view that past cum/ex
trading may have resulted in tax avoidance or
evasion. European subsidiaries of BNY have been
informed by German authorities about investigations
into potential cum/ex trading by certain third-party
investment funds, where one of the subsidiaries had
acquired entities that served as depositary and/or fund
manager for those third-party investment funds. We
have received information requests from the
authorities relating to pre-acquisition activity and are
cooperating fully with those requests. In August
2019, the District Court of Bonn ordered that one of
these subsidiaries be joined as a secondary party in
connection with the prosecution of unrelated
individual defendants. Trial commenced in

it would refrain from taking action against the
subsidiary in order to expedite the conclusion of the
trial. The court convicted the unrelated individual
defendants, and determined that the cum/ex trading
activities of the relevant third-party investment funds
were unlawful. In November and December 2020
and February 2023, we received secondary liability
notices from the German tax authorities totaling
approximately $150 million (at then-prevailing
exchange rates) related to pre-acquisition activity in
various funds for which the entities we acquired were
depositary and/or fund manager. We have appealed
the notices. In connection with the acquisition of the
subject entities, we obtained an indemnity for
liabilities from the sellers that we intend to pursue as
necessary.
Off-Channel Business-Related Communications
The Company has been responding to requests for
information from the SEC and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission concerning compliance
with recordkeeping obligations relating to business
communications transmitted on unapproved
electronic communication platforms. SEC and CFTC
have been conducting similar inquiries into
recordkeeping practices at other financial institutions.
On Aug. 14, 2024, the SEC issued an order under
which the Company agreed to pay a $40 million
penalty and to certain undertakings to resolve the
SEC matter. The fine has been paid, and the
Company is complying with the other settlement
terms. The Company continues to cooperate with the
CFTC’s inquiry.
Pershing LLC Rule 15c3-3 Matter
The Company has been responding to investigative
requests for information and records from the SEC
concerning Pershing LLC’s compliance with its
obligations under SEC Rule 15c3-3, among other
regulatory rules and statutes. The Company
continues to cooperate with the inquiry.
Note 23–Derivative instruments
We use derivatives to manage exposure to market
risk, including interest rate risk, equity price risk and
foreign currency risk, as well as credit risk. Our
trading activities are focused on acting as a marketmaker for our customers and facilitating customer
trades in compliance with the Volcker Rule.
The notional amounts for derivative financial
instruments express the dollar volume of the
transactions; however, credit risk is much smaller.
We perform credit reviews and enter into netting
agreements and collateral arrangements to minimize
the credit risk of derivative financial instruments. We
enter into offsetting positions to reduce exposure to
foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risk.
Use of derivative financial instruments involves
reliance on counterparties. Failure of a counterparty
to honor its obligation under a derivative contract is a
risk we assume whenever we engage in a derivative
contract. There were no counterparty default losses
recorded in 2024.
Hedging derivatives
We utilize interest rate swap agreements, including
forward starting swaps, to manage our exposure to
interest rate fluctuations. We enter into fair value
hedges as an interest rate risk management strategy to
reduce fair value variability by converting certain
fixed rate interest payments associated with availablefor-sale securities, loans and long-term debt to
floating interest rates. We also utilize interest rate
swaps and forward exchange contracts as cash flow
hedges to manage our exposure to interest rate and
foreign exchange rate changes. In designating
interest rate swaps as hedges, we utilize both partialterm and full-term hedge strategies.
The available-for-sale securities hedged consist of
U.S. Treasury, agency and non-agency commercial
MBS, agency and non-agency RMBS, non-U.S.
government and foreign covered bonds. At Dec. 31,
2024, $36.9 billion par value of available-for-sale
securities were hedged with interest rate swaps
designated as fair value hedges that had notional
values of $36.9 billion.
At Dec. 31, 2024, $1.4 billion of interest rate swaps
was designated as portfolio layer method fair value
hedges of loans against a closed portfolio of fixed rate
loans of $3.2 billion, essentially converting $1.4
billion of such fixed rate loans to a floating rate.
The fixed rate long-term debt instruments hedged
generally have original maturities of five to 30 years.
In fair value hedging relationships, fixed rate debt is
hedged with “receive fixed rate, pay variable rate”
swaps. At Dec. 31, 2024, $28.5 billion par value of
debt was hedged with interest rate swaps designated
as fair value hedges that had notional values of $28.5
billion.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
198 BNY
In addition, we utilize forward foreign exchange
contracts as hedges to mitigate foreign exchange
exposures. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts as cash flow hedges to convert certain
forecasted non-U.S. dollar revenue and expenses into
U.S. dollars. We use forward foreign exchange
contracts with maturities of 15 months or less as cash
flow hedges to hedge our foreign exchange exposure
to currencies such as the Indian rupee, Polish zloty,
Hong Kong dollar, Singapore dollar, British pound
and euro used in revenue and expense transactions for
entities that have the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. As of Dec. 31, 2024, the hedged forecasted
foreign currency transactions and designated forward
foreign exchange contract hedges were $765 million
(notional), with a pre-tax loss of $4 million recorded
in accumulated OCI. Over the next 12 months, a loss
of $6 million will be reclassified into earnings.
From time-to-time, we have utilized forward foreign
exchange contracts as fair value hedges of the foreign
exchange risk associated with available-for-sale
securities. Forward points are designated as an
excluded component and amortized into earnings
over the hedge period. At Dec. 31, 2024, there were
no remaining foreign exchange contracts.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are also used to
hedge the value of our net investments in foreign
subsidiaries. These forward foreign exchange
contracts have maturities of less than one year. The
derivatives employed are designated as hedges of
changes in value of our foreign investments due to
exchange rates. The change in fair market value of
these forward foreign exchange contracts is reported
within foreign currency translation adjustments in
shareholders’ equity, net of tax. At Dec. 31, 2024,
forward foreign exchange contracts with notional
amounts totaling $11.3 billion were designated as net
investment hedges.
From time-to-time, we also designate non-derivative
financial instruments as hedges of our net investments
in foreign subsidiaries. At Dec. 31, 2024, there were
no non-derivative financial instruments hedging our
net investments in foreign subsidiaries.

Trading activities (including trading derivatives)
Our trading activities are focused on acting as a
market-maker for our customers, facilitating customer
trades and risk-mitigating economic hedging in
compliance with the Volcker Rule. The change in the
fair value of the derivatives utilized in our trading
activities is recorded in foreign exchange revenue and
investment and other revenue on the consolidated
income statement.
The following table presents our foreign exchange
revenue and other trading revenue.
Foreign exchange revenue and
other trading revenue Year ended Dec. 31,
(in millions) 2024 2023 2022
Foreign exchange revenue $ 688 $ 631 $ 822
Other trading revenue 314 231 149
Foreign exchange revenue includes income from
purchasing and selling foreign currencies, currency
forwards, futures and options, as well as foreign
currency remeasurement. Other trading revenue
reflects results from trading in cash instruments,
including fixed income and equity securities, and
trading and economic hedging activity with nonforeign exchange derivatives.
We also use derivative financial instruments as riskmitigating economic hedges, which are not formally
designated as accounting hedges. This includes
hedging the foreign currency, interest rate or market
risks inherent in some of our balance sheet exposures,
such as seed capital investments and deposits, as well
as certain investment management fee revenue
streams. We also use total return swaps to
economically hedge obligations arising from the
Company’s deferred compensation plan whereby the
participants defer compensation and earn a return
linked to the performance of investments they select.
The gains or losses on these total return swaps are
recorded in staff expense on the consolidated income
statement and were gains of $18 million in 2024 and
$22 million in 2023 and a loss of $43 million in 2022.
We manage trading risk through a system of position
limits, a value-at-risk (“VaR”) methodology based on
historical simulation and other market sensitivity
measures. Risk is monitored and reported to senior
management by a separate unit, independent from
trading, on a daily basis. Based on certain
assumptions, the VaR methodology is designed to
capture the potential overnight pre-tax dollar loss
from adverse changes in fair values of all trading
positions. The calculation assumes a one-day holding
period, utilizes a 99% confidence level and
incorporates non-linear product characteristics. The
VaR model is one of several statistical models used to
develop economic capital results, which are allocated
to lines of business for computing risk-adjusted
performance.
VaR methodology does not evaluate risk attributable
to extraordinary financial, economic or other
occurrences. As a result, the risk assessment process
includes a number of stress scenarios based upon the
risk factors in the portfolio and management’s
assessment of market conditions. Additional stress
scenarios based upon historical market events are also
performed. Stress tests may incorporate the impact of
reduced market liquidity and the breakdown of
historically observed correlations and extreme
scenarios. VaR and other statistical measures, stress
testing and sensitivity analysis are incorporated into
other risk management materials.
Counterparty credit risk and collateral
We assess the credit risk of our counterparties
through regular examination of their financial
statements, confidential communication with the
management of those counterparties and regular
monitoring of publicly available credit rating
information. This and other information is used to
develop proprietary credit rating metrics used to
assess credit quality.
Collateral requirements are determined after a
comprehensive review of the credit quality of each
counterparty. Collateral is generally held or pledged
in the form of cash and/or highly liquid government
securities. Collateral requirements are monitored and
adjusted daily.
Additional disclosures concerning derivative financial
instruments are provided in Note 20.
Disclosure of contingent features in OTC derivative
instruments
Certain OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements contain credit risk-contingent features
triggered upon a rating downgrade in which the
counterparty has the right to request additional

collateral or the right to terminate the contracts in a
net liability position.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of
OTC derivative contracts in net liability positions that
contained credit risk-contingent features and the
value of collateral that has been posted.

The aggregate fair value of OTC derivative contracts
containing credit risk-contingent features can
fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to changes in
market conditions, composition of counterparty
trades, new business or changes to the contingent
features.
The Bank of New York Mellon, our largest banking
subsidiary, enters into the substantial majority of our
OTC derivative contracts and/or collateral
agreements. As such, the contingent features may be
triggered if The Bank of New York Mellon’s longterm issuer rating were downgraded.
The following table shows the fair value of contracts
falling under early termination provisions that were in
net liability positions for three key ratings triggers.

collateral pledged for these transactions, we could be
required to provide additional collateral to the
counterparty, therefore decreasing the amount of
assets available for other liquidity needs that may
arise. BNY also offers tri-party collateral agency
services in the tri-party repo market where we are
exposed to credit risk. In order to mitigate this risk,
we require dealers to fully secure intraday credit.
Note 24–Business segments
We have an internal information system that produces
performance data along product and service lines for
our three principal business segments and the Other
segment.
The primary products and services and types of
revenue in each line of business and a description of

Business accounting principles
Our business segment data has been determined on an
internal management basis of accounting, rather than
GAAP, which is used for consolidated financial
reporting. These measurement principles are
designed so that reported results of the businesses
will track their economic performance.
Our business segments are consistent with the
structure used by the President and Chief Executive
Officer, our Chief Operating Decision Maker
(“CODM”), to make key operating decisions and
assess performance. Our CODM evaluates the
business segments’ operating performance primarily
based on fee and other revenue, total revenue, income
before income taxes, and pre-tax operating margin.
The significant expense information regularly
provided to and reviewed by the CODM is total
noninterest expense. The CODM considers this
information when evaluating the performance of each
business segment and making decisions about
allocating capital and other resources to each business
segment.
Business segment results are subject to
reclassification when organizational changes are
made, or for refinements in revenue and expense
allocation methodologies. Refinements are typically
reflected on a prospective basis. In 2024, we made
certain realignments of similar products and services
within our lines of business. The largest change was
the movement of Institutional Solutions from
Pershing to Clearance and Collateral Management,
both in the Market and Wealth Services business
segment. We made other smaller changes that moved
activity from Asset Servicing in the Securities
Services business segment to Treasury Services in the
Market and Wealth Services business segment, and
from Wealth Management in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment and Pershing
in the Market and Wealth Services business segment
to Investment Management in the Investment and
Wealth Management business segment. The Other
segment was not impacted by the changes. Business
segment results for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022
have been revised to reflect these changes.
The accounting policies of the businesses are the
same as those described in Note 1.
The results of our business segments are presented
and analyzed on an internal management reporting
basis.
• Revenue amounts reflect fee and other revenue
generated by each business and include revenue
for services provided between the segments that
are also provided to third parties. Fee and other
revenue transferred between businesses under
revenue transfer agreements is included within
other fees in each segment.
• Revenues and expenses associated with specific
client bases are included in those businesses. For
example, foreign exchange activity associated
with clients using custody products is included in
the Securities Services segment.
• Net interest income is allocated to businesses
based on the yields on the assets and liabilities
generated by each business. We employ a funds
transfer pricing system that matches funds with
the specific assets and liabilities of each business
based on their interest sensitivity and maturity
characteristics.
• The provision for credit losses associated with the
respective credit portfolios is reflected in each
segment.
• Incentives expense related to restricted stock and
RSUs is allocated to the segments.
• Support and other indirect expenses, including
services provided between segments that are not
provided to third parties or not subject to a
revenue transfer agreement, are allocated to
businesses based on internally developed
methodologies and reflected in noninterest
expense.
• Recurring FDIC expense is allocated to the
businesses based on average deposits generated
within each business.
• Severance expense is recorded in the segments
based on the business or function the impacted
employees reside, with severance expense related
to corporate staff, technology and operations
reflected in the Other segment.
• Litigation expense is generally recorded in the
business in which the charge occurs.
• Management of the securities portfolio is a shared
service contained in the Other segment. As a
result, gains and losses associated with the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)
206 BNY
valuation of the securities portfolio are generally
included in the Other segment.
• Client deposits serve as the primary funding
source for our securities portfolio. We typically
allocate all interest income to the businesses
generating the deposits.
• Balance sheet assets and liabilities and their
related income or expense are specifically
assigned to each business. Segments with a net
liability position have been allocated assets.
• Goodwill and intangible assets are reflected
within individual businesses.
The following consolidating schedules present the contribution of our segments to our overall profitability.

Note 25–International operations
International activity includes investment services fee
revenue and investment management and
performance fee revenue generating businesses,
foreign exchange trading activity, loans and other
revenue producing assets and transactions in which
the customer is domiciled outside of the U.S. and/or
the international activity is resident at an international
entity. Due to the nature of our international and
domestic activities, it is not possible to precisely
distinguish our international operations between
internationally and domestically domiciled customers.
As a result, it is necessary to make certain subjective
assumptions such as:
• Income from international operations is
determined after internal allocations for interest
income, taxes, expenses and provision for credit
losses.
• Expense charges to international operations
include those directly incurred in connection with
such activities, as well as an allocable share of
general support and overhead charges.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors
The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation:
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Bank of New York Mellon
Corporation and subsidiaries (BNY) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of
income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In
our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
BNY as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the
years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States) (PCAOB), BNY’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of BNY’s internal control over financial reporting.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of BNY’s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting
firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to BNY in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to
assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or
fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test
basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the
consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit
committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial
statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication
of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as
a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the
critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
210 BNY
Quantitative component of BNY’s pooled allowance for credit losses for loans and lending-related
commitments related to higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans
secured by commercial real estate
As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, BNY’s allowance for credit losses
for loans and lending-related commitments (ACL), is presented as a valuation allowance to loans and is
recorded in other liabilities for lending-related commitments. At December 31, 2024, BNY had an allowance
for loan losses of $294 million and an allowance for lending-related commitments of $72 million. BNY
utilizes a quantitative methodology and qualitative framework for determining the ACL for loans and
lending-related commitments that share similar risk characteristics (pooled allowance). In estimating the
quantitative component, BNY uses models and methodologies that categorize financial assets based on
product type, collateral type, and other credit trends and risk characteristics, including relevant information
about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic
conditions that affect the collectability of the recorded amounts. The quantitative component of the ACL for
loans and lending-related commitments consists of the following three elements: (1) a pooled allowance for
higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real
estate; (2) a pooled allowance for residential mortgage loans; and (3) an asset-specific allowance involving
individually evaluated credits of $1 million or greater. In estimating the quantitative component of the
pooled allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans
secured by commercial real estate, BNY uses a methodology that applies the probability of default (PD)
and loss given default (LGD) to the estimated facility amount at default. In order to capture the unique risks
of the portfolios within the PD and LGD models, and the model used to estimate the facility amount at
default, BNY segments the portfolio into major components based on risk characteristics of the loans and
how risk is monitored. For each commercial and institutional credit, the expected loss considers the credit’s
risk rating. For each loan secured by commercial real estate, the expected loss considers collateral
specific data and loan maturity, as well as commercial real estate market factors by geographical region
and property type. The methodology incorporates a multi-scenario macroeconomic forecast of economic
input variables over a reasonable and supportable forecast period spanning the life of the asset. The
reasonable and supportable forecast period includes both an initial estimated economic outlook component
as well as a reversion component for each economic input variable. A portion of the ACL is comprised of
qualitative adjustments, based on various internal and external factors, intended to capture expected
losses not reflected in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit
losses.
We identified the assessment of the quantitative component of the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated
and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate as a
critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective
and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated
and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate due to
significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the
methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD and LGD, the macroeconomic
forecast scenarios and weighting of each scenario used in the reasonable and supportable forecast, and
credit risk ratings for commercial and institutional credits. The assessment also included an evaluation of
the conceptual soundness and performance of the PD and LGD models as well as the macroeconomic
forecast assumptions. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit
evidence obtained.
BNY 211
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to BNY’s measurement
of the quantitative component of the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and
institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate, including controls related to the:
● development and approval of the ACL methodology
● development of certain PD and LGD models
● continued use and appropriateness of certain PD and LGD models and macroeconomic forecasts
● performance monitoring of the PD and LGD models and macroeconomic forecast methodology
● determination and measurement of the significant factors and assumptions used in the PD and LGD
models and macroeconomic forecasts
● determination of the multi-scenario macroeconomic forecasts and their respective weights
● assessment of credit risk ratings
● computation, analysis, and approval of the ACL results, trends, and ratios.
We evaluated BNY’s process to develop the quantitative component of the pooled allowance for higher
risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate
by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that BNY used, and considered the relevance
and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with
specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
● evaluating the quantitative component of BNY’s pooled allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated
commercial and institutional credits and loans secured by commercial real estate for compliance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
● evaluating judgments made by BNY relative to the development and performance monitoring of the PD
and LGD models and macroeconomic forecasts by comparing them to relevant company-specific
metrics and trends and the applicable industry and regulatory practices
● assessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of the PD and LGD models and
macroeconomic forecast methodology by inspecting the model documentation to determine whether
they are suitable for their intended use
● testing the reasonable and supportable forecast period to evaluate the length of the period by
comparing to specific portfolio risk characteristics and trends
● testing individual loan risk ratings for a selection of higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and
institutional credits by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and
any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral.
We also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the quantitative component of
the pooled allowance for higher risk-rated and pass-rated commercial and institutional credits and loans
secured by commercial real estate by evaluating the:
● Cumulative results of the audit procedures
212 BNY
● Qualitative aspects of BNY’s accounting practices
● Potential bias in the accounting estimate.
Identification and measurement of accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies
As discussed in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements, BNY establishes accruals for litigation
and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and
reasonably estimable. BNY has disclosed that for those matters described where BNY is able to estimate
reasonably possible losses, the aggregate range of such reasonably possible losses at December 31,
2024, is up to $690 million in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters.
We identified the assessment of the identification and measurement of BNY’s accruals for litigation and
regulatory contingencies as a critical audit matter. Due to the measurement uncertainty, subjective and
complex auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. Specifically,
this assessment included the evaluation of the subjective estimates used to determine the range of
possible exposure and the probability of the predicted outcome based on the particular facts and
circumstances at issue in each of the matters.
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to BNY’s process to
identify, evaluate and measure accruals for litigation and regulatory contingencies and the reasonably
possible losses. We performed inquiries of BNY to gain an understanding of any asserted or unasserted
litigation, claims and assessments, and significant changes in individual accruals for litigation and
regulatory contingencies. We performed inquiries of BNY’s regulators and examined regulatory reports to
gain an understanding of developments of regulatory activity and related matters that may result in the
assessment of regulatory fines or penalties. We obtained and read letters received directly from BNY’s
internal legal counsel and a selection of external legal counsel that identified and described BNY’s potential
exposure to certain legal or regulatory proceedings. For cases that have settled, we performed back-testing
analyses of BNY’s litigation and regulatory contingency accruals recorded compared to amounts paid. We
assessed the accrual for litigation and regulatory contingencies and evaluated the cumulative results of the
procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. We also evaluated the
information included within the disclosures.
Valuation of goodwill for the Investment Management reporting unit
As discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the goodwill balance as of
December 31, 2024, was $16.6 billion, of which $6.0 billion is allocated to the Investment Management
reporting unit. BNY performs goodwill impairment testing on an annual basis and an interim test is
performed when events or circumstances occur that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair
value of any reporting unit may be less than its carrying value. This involves estimating the fair value of the
reporting units using an income approach which discounts estimated future cash flows that incorporate
various assumptions including a long-term growth rate.
We identified the assessment of the valuation of goodwill for the Investment Management reporting unit as
a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and
subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the evaluation of goodwill and determination of
fair value for the Investment Management reporting unit due to significant measurement uncertainty relating
to specific assumptions used in the valuation. Specifically, these assumptions included the discount rate
and the long-term growth rate.
BNY 213
The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated
the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to BNY’s determination
of the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions for the Investment Management reporting unit.
We evaluated the reasonableness of BNY’s long-term growth rate for the Investment Management
reporting unit, by comparing BNY’s growth rates within historical revenue forecasts to actual results to
assess BNY’s ability to accurately forecast. In addition, we involved valuation professionals with specialized
skills and knowledge, who assisted in:
● Assessing the reasonableness of the valuation approach including the discount rate and long-term
growth rate assumptions used by BNY to calculate the fair value of the Investment Management
reporting unit for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
● Evaluating the discount rate by developing an independent range for the discount rate used in the
valuation and comparing the inputs to the discount rate to publicly available data and assessing the
resulting discount rate
● Testing the long-term growth rate by developing an independent assumption of the long-term growth
rate and comparing the long-term growth rate to publicly available data
We have served as BNY’s auditor since 2007.

This graph shows The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation’s cumulative total shareholder returns over the fiveyear period from Dec. 31, 2019 to Dec. 31, 2024. We utilize the S&P 500 Financials Index as a benchmark against
our performance. The graph shows the cumulative total returns for the same five-year period of the S&P 500
Financials Index and the S&P 500 Index. The comparison assumes a $100 investment on Dec. 31, 2019 in The
Bank of New York Mellon Corporation common stock, in the S&P 500 Financials Index and in the S&P 500 Index
and assumes that all dividends were reinvested.
